Warehouse district PERSONA People often assume that Blackwall’s citizens are dour and grim, weighted down by a military life. This is true to an extent. Military service is mandatory for all who come of age in the city, though they are required to serve only a few years. Citizens do take their duties seriously and train hard, ready to defend Blackwall and Kaddas against any invader. In all other respects, Blackwall’s people are a cheer-ful, fun-loving folk. They welcome travelers who have proven themselves trustworthy. They shop at the bazaar for foreign goods, they laugh with delight at the antics of traveling entertainers, and they enjoy the camaraderie of a night with friends in a tavern. Crime in Blackwall is common, but it is made up mostly of petty, mild offenses that draw fines or short prison sentences. The infrequent violent criminal receives harsh punishment, almost always involving exile or execution. FOUR WINDS (THE TRADING HUB)",

Four Winds stands at the crossroads of two major highways that enable trade and travel between four great nations. The city exists for commerce, and it has grown to its current size as the literal center of its economic region. The city operates undr a tra-ditional, aristocratic government that is supported by all four of the nearby kingdoms, each of which is pleased to see the nobility in charge of so vital a mer-cantile center. Four Winds has a higher gp limit than most cities its size due to the constant inﬂ  ux of travelers and mer- chant caravans from all over the world. It frequently houses more than 8,000 travelers in addition to its usual population. Both an increased spending limit and a high transient population are common features of major trading cities. ARCHITECTURE The major structures of Four Winds are large and impressive, yet lack any single unifying style. The city’s architects are torn between the conﬂ  icting desires of impressing merchants and dignitaries from distant lands and avoiding the appearance of bias toward any one cul-ture. As a result, public buildings reach for a grandiosity they fail to attain, conveying a sense of pomposity without any real majesty. They appear to be based on descriptions of other great structures never actually seen by residents of the city. Unimportant buildings, such as small shops and the private homes of less prominent citizens, are simple, built of inexpensive wood. Most are plain and unadorned, but some feature gaudy decor in a feeble effort to appear more important than they are. LAYOUT Four Winds is surrounded by a single defensive wall, 20 feet tall and 10 feet thick. The wall is wide enough for guards to patrol and strong enough to withstand at least a brief siege (hardness 8, 450 hp, break DC 55). Yet a trading hub cannot afford to make access difficult, and the city has never needed to repulse invaders. Thus, vast gates pierce the wall at many points, including on each of the four main roads. Though they normally stand open day and night, the gates are solid and defensible, constructed of heavy wood (hardness 5, 20 hp, break DC 23). Each gate has a standing guard of two city watch soldiers (5th-level human warriors).  The city government spares no expense in road maintenance, even when cutting costs in other services. The cobblestone streets are built to accommodate feet, hooves, and wheels. The main roads are abnormally wide, allowing even the largest wagon to pass unhindered. Intersections have clearly marked street names, and most major thoroughfares are lit at night by lanterns or—in the richest portions of town—by continual ﬂ  ame  effects. The layout of the minor streets is a simple grid, so visi- tors can easily ﬁ  nd their way around. Smaller roads and alleys are hidden from the main roads behind buildings, ensuring that merchants are not inconvenienced by trash or beggars. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   12620_95386_Ch1.indd   12 8/21/06   4:43:50 PM8/21/06   4:43:50 PM13CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY 620_95386_Ch1.indd   13620_95386_Ch1.indd   13 8/21/06   4:43:59 PM8/21/06   4:43:59 PM14 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYFour Winds Map Key The keyed locations on the Four Winds map indicate various districts of the city.

Warehouse district PERSONA Ironically, Four Winds’ attempts to remain culturally neutral have produced a unique personality. Styles and fashions from nearby kingdoms and farther lands blend to create a riot of colors, garish to visitors but considered the height of taste by the inhabitants. Foods, music, games, and languages from the world over are equally mingled—Four Winds has a scent and an accent all its own. The people of Four Winds have an overdeveloped sense of their own importance to the region, but they try to hide that attitude from travelers. Citizens believe them- selves to be cosmopolitan and declare their tolerance of others, but they actually hold fairly provincial attitudes. They scoff at unfamiliar beliefs and often mock the dress and behavior of foreigners—but only out of earshot, since they want visitors to feel comfortable and thus be willing spend money in the city. This facade manifests as a sense of brittle politeness, a pseudo-friendliness that visitors notice. Merchants ﬂ  ock to Four Winds to trade—or at least to stop over on their journeys to other markets—but few foreigners stay long.  In order to make merchants feel safe and secure, the city government makes a show of rigidly enforcing the law. In truth, Four Winds has an exceptionally high crime rate, but so long as miscreants limit their activi-ties to picking pockets and other petty thefts, the guard grants them some latitude in the name of maintaining the peace. Should a foreign merchant be harmed or murdered, however, the guard turns Four Winds upside-down in the search for the perpetrator. DRAGONPORT (THE PORT CITY)",

Kaddastrei is the grand capital of Kaddas, the last remnant of an ancient empire and still a rich and power- ful nation. Many state capitals follow the models of military cities or trading hubs (as presented earlier), but Kaddastrei is a city built for no other purpose than to be its nation’s capital. Kaddastrei and Kaddas proper are currently ruled by King Rumeius IV. The monarchy of Kaddas is passed on to the oldest child in a commonly seen system of succes- sion; at the same time, custom demands that the ruler be versed in the arts of wizardry. Thus, Kaddastrei’s power center is both conventional and magical. ARCHITECTURE The ofﬁ  cial ediﬁ  ces of Kaddastrei are grand and tower- ing showcases, with sweeping arches and tall spires crowned by bright pennants. Though built primarily of granite, these structures bear white marble facades. The lower levels have bright windows of stained glass, while the upper stories are pierced by arrow slits. The palace itself is as large as a small village. It contains not only the king’s living and working quarters, but most of the city’s governmental ofﬁ  ces, an entire military garrison, and a magical laboratory used by King Rumeius and the other royal wizards. Nongovernment buildings, such as shops and private homes, are also of far nicer construction than in many other cities. Citizens keep their property clean, and many whitewash their houses. Even modest homes likely have at least two stories, with some boasting as many as four or five. As often seen in a military city, many of Kaddastrei’s roofs are flat. They can serve as archery platforms should the city ever face invasion, but they more often function as vantage points from which citizens can view the monarch and other nobles passing in procession. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   18620_95386_Ch1.indd   18 8/21/06   4:45:37 PM8/21/06   4:45:37 PM19CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY 620_95386_Ch1.indd   19620_95386_Ch1.indd   19 8/21/06   4:45:47 PM8/21/06   4:45:47 PM20 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYLAYOUT Kaddastrei is surrounded by a layered defensive wall rivaling that of any military stronghold, 32 feet in height and 15 feet thick. It has hardness 8, 1,170 hp, and a break DC of 70. The city’s gates are larger and more numerous than those in most fortified cities, the better to allow entry for royal or ambassadorial processions. Constructed of iron (hardness 10, 60 hp, break DC 28), each gate is normally open but guarded by six royal soldiers (5th-level human warriors). A second, smaller wall surrounds the palace, which sits atop a small rise. This wall is 10 feet high and 1 foot thick, constructed of stone (hardness 8, 180 hp, break DC 40). Each of its heavy wooden gates (hard-ness 5, 20 hp, break DC 23 ) is normally guarded by four royal soldiers. The main roads of the city form an off-center circular grid. Impossibly wide avenues stab straight from the palace to the many city gates, like beams from a sun, while perpendicular roads ring it in concentric circles. Smaller streets and alleys connect the larger ways like strands of a cobweb. No beggars haunt the main thoroughfares, and every building lining them is whitewashed and clean. These cobbled avenues are scrupulously maintained. In many places, arched bridges leap overhead, making the entire city feel like an enormous palace. The main avenues are lit by continual ﬂ  ame lampposts, all streets are clearly labeled, and major intersections boast per-manent guards.

Warehouse district PERSONA The people of Kaddastrei know the importance of their city, and they can be arrogant and pompous as a result. Visitors often find them tiresome. Nevertheless, the population is quite cosmopolitan. Citizens view other races, unusual cultures, and strange magic with tolerance, if not outright welcome. Crime in Kaddastrei falls under the purview of several accredited thieves guilds, all of which have standing arrangements with the city guard and with the crown. So long as they keep a tight leash on their mem- bers and avoid robbing or assaulting anyone important, the criminal guilds operate with minimal interference. While many in power dislike this arrangement, they recognize that the alternative would be a larger number of independent, unrestricted criminals. The guilds enforce the protection of individuals designated as off limits and eliminate competition by outside thieves, performing both functions far more efficiently than the city watch could manage. This situation perpetu-ates a belief, at least among the capital’s wealthy, that this “ultimate city” is practically free of crime, while it alienates the poor who suffer the depredations of the guilds.

Named for the way in which the city is built into the side of a mountain, Cliffside is a thriving community perched on the very edge of an ocean coastline. The ar e a ’ s  n a ti v e  r e s i d e n t s ,  a  c o n gl o m e ra ti o n  o f  n a tur e-worshiping halﬂ  ing tribes, built their ﬁ  rst homes here in comfortable caves located higher up on the mountain, 620_95386_Ch1.indd   20620_95386_Ch1.indd   20 8/21/06   4:46:13 PM8/21/06   4:46:13 PM21CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY away from the sea. When expansion began in earnest, the tribes invited skilled builders from neighboring dwarf and human communities to help plan and produce a true city in the mountain. In exchange, the foreign workers were allowed to stay and live in peace among the grateful residents. The dwarves’ knack for construction, coupled with the humans’ sense of style and efﬁ  ciency, turned Cliffside into a fascinating example of unusual urban design. Cliffside’s ofﬁ  cial government is a council of druids, harking back to the halﬂ  ings’ forebears, but their rule doesn’t go unchallenged. An inﬂ  uential cult exists within the city, dedicated to an ancient sea deity—a goddess said to have shaped Cliffside’s original caves with the power of wind and rain. Some followers of this cult cooperate with the dominant faiths, merely encouraging the occa- sional bit of “tribute to the sea” (which accomplishes their goals without insulting anyone’s beliefs). Other folowers campaign for a return to living sacriﬁ  ce to appease the sea deity, lest she return and send destruction against the now developed city. ARCHITECTURE Cliffside is unusual in that most of its foundation was laid by nature. Millennia of seasonal storms blowing in from the ocean eroded vast openings in the moun- 620_95386_Ch1.indd   21620_95386_Ch1.indd   21 8/21/06   4:46:23 PM8/21/06   4:46:23 PM22 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYtainside, resulting in something resembling a massive insect hive fashioned of stone. Most structures are primarily carved from the native rock, working artiﬁ  cial elements smoothly into the natural. Builders take care to strengthen the sides of the buildings that directly face the water, reinforcing the existing stone with treated wood, magic, or both. The locals have a natural facility with wood, which grows in abundance on the top of the cliff. Only at the highest elevations, where the wealthy and powerful dwell, do structures use more attractive or more delicate substances. LAYOUT Cliffside features several main “roads,” with a number of crisscrossing “side streets.” In a city in which each struc- ture is at a slightly different elevation from every other one, creating traditional thoroughfares is a challenge. The original residents used ropes and natural ledges to get around, and crossing from one side of the city to the other required a fair bit of climbing. The city’s engineers later decided to build upon this system rather than discard it entirely; the result more resembles a network of suspension bridges than a customary street layout. This network of so-called bridgeways connects all the major neighborhoods to a large area of ﬂ  at ground about halfway up the mountainside. This open space is the closest thing Cliffside has to a town square, and many of the major businesses and markets are located there or nearby. The remainder of the city, particularly the poorer neighborhoods farther down the mountain, is more like a hive. Business zones are the easiest to reach and navigate, with private residences taking up outlying areas of town. Visitors who arrive by sea face quite a climb, whether they seek supplies or wish to consult with city luminar- ies. Most of the city’s important locations are at least midway up the cliff. Strangers in Cliffside are encour- aged to stick to the safest areas of the city, including the central plaza and the strongest bridgeways leading to it.

Warehouse district PERSONA Despite its unique foundation, Cliffside remains a halﬂ  ing community at heart, and it still feels like one. Daily life here is precarious, yet the locals ﬁ  nd the time to offer up a pleasant smile or cheerful greeting even to total strangers. Because of their origins and beliefs, the halﬂ  ings of Cliffside aren’t as innately good-hearted as some of their more pastoral cousins, but neither are they evil as a group. Living in such an environment requires absolute harmony with its perilous nature. Despite prog- ress and solid engineering, Cliffside still sees a number of injuries and deaths from falling or drowning every year. Proximity to potential disaster and loss has given the people a hard edge, but it hasn’t stripped them of their compassion. C l i f f s i d e  i s  l a r g e l y  b e r e f t  o f  c r i m e ,  u n l i k e  o t h e r  coastal cities. The easygoing nature of its inhabitants, coupled with the magical power of its ruling body, discourages unpleasant behavior. As usual, though, this condition holds less true in the poorest sections of town, where many residents don’t have the wealth or skill even to secure their homes with doors. The city does maintain a watch (which reports directly to the druid council), but since it is composed primarily of humans, it focuses on protecting other humans rather than the halfling locals. Poor residents are left to fend for themselves, which not only encourages crime but fosters resentment toward both the watch and the ruling elite. Cities by Culture All the above example cities assume a human-dominated culture. If this is not the case in your campaign, you might wish to modify your city descriptions to better ﬁ  t a dominant nonhuman outlook. DWARF CITIES Other than humans, dwarves are the most proliﬁ  c city- builders among the common humanoid races. Dwarves work with stone, pure and simple. Wood is for burning, 620_95386_Ch1.indd   22620_95386_Ch1.indd   22 8/21/06   4:46:46 PM8/21/06   4:46:46 PM23CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYfor buttressing tunnels to prevent cave-ins, or to provide a framework for heavier materials. The traditional image of the underground dwarf com- plex is roughly accurate, but it represents only one method of construction. Dwarves who build underground carve entire cities out of the rock: rooms, hallways, massive chambers, even wide-open spaces such as town squares and temples. Where they can, dwarves build within and around preexisting caves. Some underground cities consist of simple rooms shaped from the exist- ing space, while others are true buildings—complete with walls, roofs, and windows—erected within enor-mous caverns. Surface-dwelling dwarves also prefer to build in stone, recreating the earthen womb from which their race hails. These surface cities are usually well defended, built within isolated valleys or surrounded by walls so thick that they contain rooms themselves. Buildings have heavy doors and relatively few windows, giving them an even greater sense of weight. In either case, dwarves prefer to build vertically rather than horizontally, a practice dating from a time when their race was restricted to cramped underground cav- erns. A dwarf city takes advantage of natural elevation, so that squat-looking buildings actually rise several stories. In some cases, one level of the city shares a single ceil-ing, which also serves as the ﬂ  oor for a second layer of buildings above. For more on dwarf culture and communities, see Races of Stone . ELF CITIES Elves build their cities in conjunction with nature, rather than in opposition to it. This attitude doesn’t mean that every community consists of tree houses, as some smaller elf villages do, but rather that buildings incorporate their surroundings into their construction. The long-lived elves can afford to slowly shape and grow their environment as they desire. Many elven buildings use living trees as support columns, or leave room for trees to grow through floors and ceilings. Tree branches might be woven together to form bridges between city districts. Some structures have no constructed floor on the ground level, instead retaining the existing soil with living grass. In communities where magic is commonplace, elves might use spells to shape nonliving materials such as quartz into buildings. Magic can also form living trees into habitable structures. Many communities Elves build their cities in conjunction with nature, rather than in conﬂ  ict with itIllus. by J. Hodgson 620_95386_Ch1.indd   23620_95386_Ch1.indd   23 8/21/06   4:46:55 PM8/21/06   4:46:55 PM24 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYhave running water and sewer systems; rather than using pipes and pumps, they employ magically created ch ann e ls t o an d fro m n earb y ri v e rs, o r e v e n create/ destroy water  spells. Elf cities are always constructed near sources of fresh water and always have some means of defense. Examples are a surrounding wall of trees to serve as archery platforms, and a city built atop a high rise. For more on elf culture and communities, see  Races of the Wild . GNOME CITIES Gnomes often build underground, but their communities are quite different from those of dwarves. They rarely build complex structures, but simply carve comfortable homes out of the rock. Their cities remain near the surface, for ease of farming and gardening—some are not subterranean at all. Surface-dwelling gnomes build simple homes from wood, stone, or whatever materials are handy. Humans are often surprised by how much gnome buildings resemble their own (allowing for the difference in scale, of course).  Gnomes do not overplan their cities, expanding them as the need arises rather than conforming to a prear- ranged layout. Their cities are lightly defended, if at all. Gnomes prefer escape routes and ambush points over fortifications. For more on gnome communities, see Races of Stone .HALFLING CITIES Halﬂ  ings rarely build their own cities. Many are nomadic, and those who choose to settle usually establish small settlements or live amid human cities. The rare halﬂ  ing town that grows large enough to qualify as a city is little more than a jumble of wooden structures. Half-ling cities grow from and into their environment, in much the same way as Cliffside ( see page 20). Half-lings do not build solely around natural elements as elves do, but they work the natural surroundings into their buildings’ features. Halfling homes are often adorned with colorful plants, or roofed in thatch and heavy leaves. Many are open to the outside, with large windows or even entire missing walls, using sheets of canvas for protection against storms. Like elves, halflings prefer to build near natural water sources and fertile soil. For more on halﬂ  ing communities, see Races of the Wild . ORC AND GOBLINOID CITIES While a few exceptions exist (notably hobgoblins), orcs and the various goblinoids have primitive cul- tures, which are reflected in their cities. A typical city consists primarily of rough wooden buildings, with",

Hagan 620_95386_Ch1.indd   24620_95386_Ch1.indd   24 8/21/06   4:47:12 PM8/21/06   4:47:12 PM25CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYfew taller than two or three stories. Construction is crude: Doors might not fit well in their frames, or might be merely hide curtains, while roofs are often thatch or simple wood. Roads are rarely paved and follow no real plan. Most such communities have some sort of defensive perimeter, such as a wooden wall, a spiked moat, or a series of guard towers on stilts or built in trees. Many orc and goblinoid cities are subterranean and use stone rather than wood, but they otherwise resemble surface cities. They exploit defensible locales, rich natural resources, or nearby communities on which to prey. Underground cities are more oriented toward defense, often being built in caverns with limited entrances. Such cities are crudely functional, with little thought for aesthetics. Decoration is minimal: trophies from prior kills, or walls daubed with bright colors, with little sculpture or artwork. Other races assume that these primitive humanoids have no interest in beauty. Although this is true to an extent, the main factor is that orcs and goblinoids expect their communities—even the larger cities—to be temporary. They constantly struggle with other races, other tribes of their own kind, and marauding adventurers. Thus, they view any effort beyond providing the necessities of life as a waste of time and energy. PLANAR CITIES Some campaigns take characters far from familiar lands, even their own planes of existence. Cities on other planes have alien appearances. Variable laws of gravity and magic present unusual architectural and engineering challenges, at least from the human perspective. The ultimate example is Sigil, the City of Doors. Here on the hub of the Concordant Domain of the Outlands, reality bends over itself: Anywhere within the city, one can look up into the sky and see the same city. Like elves, the builders and inhabitants of planar cities are extremely long-lived, and their urban centers reﬂ  ect an awareness of history and of the passage of time. At the same time, a planar city embodies a sense of eternity—it always has been and always will be as it is today. A city’s cultural outlook depends on its place in the multiverse. Cities of the Outer Planes reflect the character of the area’s native inhabitants. For example, the portal town of Ribcage in the Outlands, which borders the Nine Hells of Baator, is inhabited by fiends and petitioners of that plane. For more on planar communities, see Manual of the Planes .Unusual Locations Where a city stands affects it just as much as how it was built or who occupies it. Presented here are examples of interesting locations for cities, ranging from the mun-dane but atypical to the truly fantastic. COASTAL Not every city built on the coast is a major trading center like Dragonport (see page 14). Some grow from nearby industry or depend on local, land-based trade. Even so, such a city’s daily life and economy depend on the ocean in some way. Fishing is a common livelihood, and the local diet includes not only ﬁ  sh and crustaceans, but also seaweed and other aquatic plants.  Coast-dwellers must be ever alert for the spears of sahuagin or the tentacles of kraken, to say nothing of mundane dangers such as pirates. Because of these hazards, the defenses of a coastal city must include naval forces as well as standard infantry. This situation can actu- ally make the city more vulnerable than its landlocked counterparts, because it cannot devote all its defense to an attack from only land or sea. The climate of a coastal city tends to be temperate: Winds and currents from the ocean keep it cooler in summer and milder in winter than areas farther i n l a n d .  H o w e v e r ,  i t  i s  v u l n e r a b l e  t o  o c e a n  s t o r m s ,  floods, and tidal waves, any of which can swamp an entire community. Wise city-builders make use of water breaks and levees, or place structures on higher coastal elevations. Wealthy cities might use magical defenses, such as various permanent wall spells designed to protect against approaching water, or weather-controlling magic to prevent great storms from spawning nearby. CLIFF FACE Unlike Cliffside, which grew out from a group of sea side caves, these cities are built into sheer cliffs. Some real-life civilizations have constructed cliff-face dwellings, but in a fantasy setting such communities are usually the homes of avian races such as the raptorans, from Races of the Wild , or the aarakocra of the F ORGOTTEN REALMS ® campaign setting.  Traditional humanoid races might also build such cities, though, for a number of reasons. The location is eminently defensible, forcing attackers to rappel down or scale the cliff face, all the while vul- nerable to archers and magical attack. Even if an enemy reaches the structures, no more than a few attackers can enter at a time. Only with magic or flying troops does an army have any chance of taking a cliff-face 620_95386_Ch1.indd   25620_95386_Ch1.indd   25 8/21/06   4:47:26 PM8/21/06   4:47:26 PM26 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYcity. The city’s altitude puts it above the level of most ﬂ oods, and makes inhabitants vulnerable only to storms moving in from a speciﬁ  c direction. Not every cliff is appropriate for city-building. One must have caves to serve as homes, or at least allow for easy excavation. The dwellings must be interconnected within the cliff, or the inhabitants must build stairs or ladders on external ledges. Ledges are more vulnerable to weather and attack, but cities with ledged cliff faces are more numerous than those without. Cliff-face communities face economic challenges. Goods must be lowered from or raised to the level of the caves, requiring great feats of magic or engineer-ing. Crops are usually grown at the foot of the cliff or atop the vertical face. As a result, such cities are vulnerable to shortages (both naturally occurring and as the result of a siege); many of these communities keep stockpiles of emergency supplies deep within the caves. DIVIDED CITIES A divided city might span opposite banks of a river, spill over the top of a cliff into the valley below, or spread across a chain of tiny islands. Whatever its situation, physical, political, and social division has a major effect on the city’s development. People think of themselves as residents of their district ﬁ  rst, and then of the city as a whole. Crime rates, fashions, architecture, and decoration might be homogenous throughout the city, or they might vary so much by district that different sections feel totally distinct. A divided city might develop for any number of reasons. If the soil is more fertile across the river, or the area more defensible from a vantage point on the mountainside, the population might naturally expand in that direction. Alternatively, two neighboring commu- nities might grow into a single city, despite geographic obstacles. A city might also deliberately encompass a particular resource or holy site. Nor is such a city limited to two sections: A fork in a river might split a city in three, a mountainside town might have half a dozen districts at different elevations, and an archi- pelago city could feature dozens of tiny, independent neighborhoods. Even if no one section of the city is intended to be richer or more important than the others, its citizens will tend to liv e where they f eel most comfortable.  Invariably, one part of a divided city becomes more popular than the others, leading to resentment among the residents of other sectors. In mixed-race cities, the dominant race might occupy the bulk of one highly desirable section, leading to tension with the less privi-leged inhabitants. This tension is exacerbated when one section of the city actually is more important than the others. A city built both in a valley and atop a nearby rise can defend only the higher location, to where all the valley-dwellers must evacuate in case of an attack. A city that spans a raging river likely receives more traders and travelers on one side than the other, making the favored section wealthier and more cosmopolitan. In any city of this type, the section with the clear advantage attracts the richest and most influential dwellers, deepening the social and political divide between the districts. ISLAND CITIES Even in a low-magic setting, the island city is a perfectly realistic concept. The city’s role and inﬂ  uence depend upon the island’s location, inhabitants, and power center. For example, a metropolis might develop on an island in the middle of an ocean separating two great continents. Such a location would support a city that is both port and trading hub, vital to communication between the land masses. In settings where magic is more pervasive, a ﬂ  oating ocean city needn’t be on an island at all. The Atlantis model is a classic fantasy trope: an ancient city built by mysterious, advanced peoples that has been recently discovered. Whether it has arisen from centuries beneath the waves, or drifted in from unknown waters, such a ﬂ  oating city provides a ready-made context for exploration. On the other hand, if the city has been continuously inhabited for centuries or even millennia, its unique situation will have affected the outlook and social structure of its dwellers. Other interesting situations could produce a ﬂ  oating city. Consider a Brigadoon -esque scenario, in which the settlement (with or without its original inhabitants) lies under an ancient curse, suddenly appearing or disappear- ing in an unexpected location. Ironically, one of the biggest concerns of any island or ﬂ oating city is water. Seawater is not potable, and even Small humanoids need around 2 pints of water per day to survive, so residents need some source of fresh water. In tropical climates, they might ﬁ  ll cisterns with plentiful rainfall or have access to inland streams. Otherwise, the city requires a method of desalination, whether techno-logical or magical. SKY CITIES Another classic element of fantasy is the city in the clouds. Many of the features and challenges of island cities are likewise present in sky cities, though such locales tend to exist only in high-magic settings. In 620_95386_Ch1.indd   26620_95386_Ch1.indd   26 8/21/06   4:47:35 PM8/21/06   4:47:35 PM27CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY addition to other concerns, the residents of any aerial city must consider gravity. Stepping off the edge of an island will usually only result in wetness; stepping off or through a cloud can be downright fatal. Are citizens protected by a persistent magical effect, or do all of them have some way to ﬂ  y? Another factor to consider is whether the sky city is mobile. Some such cities move around, either through the will of their residents or an outside force. Perhaps the city’s long-gone creators built in a propulsion mechanism, or the city simply drifts with the winds. A mobile city raises new concerns that affect environ- mental and social factors, especially its interactions with other communities whose space it enters. Mun-dane concerns such as the supply of food and water, or waste disposal, also can have unusual solutions in a city that doesn’t stay put. Like other isolated areas, sky cities often have difficulty trading with others. Ev en wh en air tra v el is relativ ely common, such as  in the Eberron setting, making the trip to and from a cloud city is not trivial. Sky cities have their advantages, though, especially with regard to defense. Being a mile in the air and (if the city is mobile) being able to move away from danger makes such a city difﬁ  cult to capture without an armada of airships or hordes of ﬂ  ying troops. UNDERGROUND CITIES Nothing embodies the flavor of the D UNGEONS  \u0026 DRAGONS  game as much as the underground civiliza- tion. Within many D\u0026D campaigns, subterranean cities are hardly unusual. Still, building beneath the earth presents a special set of design constraints to city engineers. Underground cities are inexorably linked to the races that inhabit them, the sun-hating drow being the best known example. Surface-dwelling races might also build cities underground for various reasons. A cataclys- mic event, such as an unending storm or a destructive meteor shower, might force a community belowground. Alternatively, explorers might have discovered a valu- able subterranean resource, such as a massive lake with potable water and plentiful ﬁ  sh, and moved into the cave to exploit the ﬁ  nd. Adequate light, food, and air are the primary needs of an underground city. Unless the inhabitants possess darkvision, they need some form of illumination, and (assuming they are living creatures) they need to eat and breathe. Underground cities face fewer challenges to trade than those in other unusual locations. They also can attack and be attacked more easily, producing classic conﬂ  ict situations between surface-dwellers and those who live beneath them. Almorhabbi, a cloud cityIllus. by B.

Each city has its own traits and quirks. Different combinations of the following features make every city and its districts distinctive. LIGHTING A city’s or district’s general prosperity tends to correlate to its lighting at night. The worse the illumination, the poorer the area, and the higher the local crime rate. None:  The poorest cities and neighborhoods do not bother lighting their streets at all. Those who go out at night must bring their own light sources, or trust to the moons and stars. Torches:  Cities that can afford no better ill uminate their streets with simple torches on posts. Torches burn quickly and require frequent replacement, so most such cities light only their most important thoroughfares.",

The result is that only the better parts of town enjoy such illumination, even if the city can afford more.

Traditional defenses take the form of fences, walls, moats, and similar obstacles. In a fantasy setting, however, these measures are less effective than they were historically. A moat can stop an advancing army, but a dragon or a wizard can ﬂ  y right over it. A wall might be high enough to impede a 6-foot-tall human, but what about a 26-foot-tall giant? Nonetheless, such features remain the most common forms of city defense—something, after all, is better than nothing.  In most walls stronger than simple wood fences, the gates are equivalent to either strong wooden doors or iron doors ( DMG  60), depending on construction. Treat gates in a fence as good wooden doors. In all cases given below, hit points are per 10-foot section of wall. (If you’re interested in more detailed rules for defensive fortiﬁ  ca- tions, see Chapter 2: Building Adventures in the Heroes of Battle  supplement.)",

Barriers cre- ated with wall of iron  and wall of stone  differ only slightly from standard walls—and the expense of surrounding a city with such magical constructions would be sub-stantial. Instead, some communities hire spellcasters to respond to breaches in a wall during battle: A spell patches the hole far more swiftly than mundane workers could manage. The most effective magical barrier might be a per-manent wall of force  combined with a dimensional lock effect, which can withstand almost any sort of attack. But casting enough of these spells to protect an entire city is prohibitively expensive. Only the very wealthiest cities, or those ruled by arcane practitio- ners powerful enough to do the job themselves, could even consider using such methods. A slightly more common practice, though still an expensive one, is to protect only important structures or districts with pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsHAZARDS OF POOR SANITATION Bad sanitation is not only unsightly but also unhealthy. Anyone unaccustomed to the stench must make a Fortitude save upon first entering an area of bad sanitation. On a suc-cess, the character is sickened for 2d4 minutes. Failure results in the character being nauseated for 2d4 minutes and sickened for the next 24 hours. A new save is required every 24 hours, but the DC drops by 1 each day following the first. Once the save DC drops below the character’s normal Fortitude save bonus, she is no longer susceptible. The risk of disease is pervasive in such areas. Anyone in the affected area who takes more points of damage in 1 round than his current Constitution score (not modifier) must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or contract filth fever (DMG 292). 620_95386_Ch1.indd   30620_95386_Ch1.indd   30 8/21/06   4:48:26 PM8/21/06   4:48:26 PM31CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYsuch spells. In this case, mundane defenses protect the bulk of the city. Moat:  Most people think of moats as surrounding individual castles, but one can also encircle an entire city. A moat need be nothing more than a deep ditch, but it could be ﬁ  lled with water, spikes, or more horriﬁ  c substances such as acid or poisonous thorns. Treat such barriers as pit traps, water obstacles, or heavy rubble, depending on the contents. The sides of moats are steep slopes ( DMG  89). SPECIAL FEATURES A given city might have interesting or unique features not encompassed by the previous categories. Below are a few examples, both mundane and mystical. Feel free to augment these with ideas of your own, drawn from both historical and fantasy inspirations. Aqueducts:  Some advanced cities use systems of aqueducts to channel water from distant lakes and rivers. Stone pipelines and tunnels with a gradual slope direct water toward the city and into cisterns or the sewers. A fantasy city might instead use a magic portal  to a nearby lake, or even a small gate  connecting to the Elemental Plane of Water. (The latter requires guards or magical defenses against potentially hostile creatures that might arrive along with the water.) Bathhouses:  Many large cities feature communal baths, sprawling complexes of plain stone or marble where people can relax and socialize. Some contain nothing more than hot- and cold-water pools. Others are complete recreational facilities, with wine rooms, restaurants, barbers, exercise areas, and other ame-nities. Unlike most other luxuries, the baths are usually available to all citizens, though the wealthy and powerful might have access to nicer facilities. Generally, only cities with running water can have bathhouses. Canals:  A network of canals running through a city can facilitate transportation and trade, form a sewage and drainage system, or separate city districts. The canals might also be home to strange creatures, which could be allies or enemies of the city’s people. Communication and News:  How do the people of the city learn what’s going on their world? In some areas, people pick up rumors where they can, and travel- ers are the best source of news. Some cities employ a town crier, a person who walks the streets shouting about recent major events. Even without mass print-ing, simple broadsheets in the marketplace might announce upcoming events. In a high-magic setting, the city authority might project illusory images at a fixed time and place each day to inform the citizens of the latest news. Institutions:  A sizable or important city likely includes noteworthy institutions, such a wizards’ college, a major library, or a great cathedral. The institutions you include in a city affect the resources available to the citizenry (and the PCs) in a variety of ways. Interior Walls:  Some cities isolate their districts from one another with walls or gates. The presence and nature of such barriers reflect the attitudes of the city government and its upper classes, or might warn of a high crime rate (and the two factors might be connected). Monstrous Inhabitants:  Does the city welcome unusual citizens? If the dominant culture is human, does it allow giants in the army, or bugbears in the city watch? Different cities have varying levels of tolerance for monstrous inhabitants. Some might welcome unusual humanoids but nothing more exotic, while a truly fantastic metropolis might have a mind ﬂ  ayer politician or an undead district. Public Transportation:  Does the city provide some means for citizens to travel from one place to another? Depending on the context and the availability of pow-erful magic, such a service can range from carriages or rickshaws for hire to a publicly maintained system of teleportation spells. For example, in the E BERRON  setting, the city of Sharn has ﬂ  ying carriages to take citizens to its various towers.",

        "description":  "Much of a city’s wildlife feeds on garbage or dwells in the sewers, exposing the creatures to disease. Any feral animal encountered in a city has a base 10% chance of being a disease carrier. If the city has only drainage ditches to deal with waste, this chance increases to 20%; if the city has no waste disposal system at all, it rises to 40%. If an animal is a carrier, anyone it injures is susceptible to ﬁ  lth fever (Fortitude DC 12 negates). This save is in addition to any that might be required due to unsanitary conditions. Potholes:  Even on well-kept roads, cobblestones occasionally crack, or packed earth sinks, forming potentially hazardous potholes. A small pothole (1 foot or less in diameter ) requires a successful DC 15 Spot check to notice. Any creature moving on land across an undetected small pothole must succeed on a DC 10 Reﬂ  ex save or fall prone, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A small pothole does not harm a wagon or carriage, but the Concentration DC to cast spells while moving over it increases by 5. Large potholes (2 to 3 feet in diameter) are easier to detect, requiring only a DC 10 Spot check. Any creature moving on land across an undetected large pothole must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or fall prone, taking 2 points of Dexterity damage and a –5 penalty on any land-based movement rate, due to leg injury. The driver of a carriage or wagon that moves into a large pothole must succeed on a DC 15 Handle Animal or Profession (teamster) check. On a failure, the vehicle’s wheels and axles are damaged, requiring 1d20 hours and the appro-priate Craft skill to repair. Sinkholes:  Due to hollows in the earth or erosion from heavy rains, sections of land might collapse entirely. A slow sinkhole is comparable to quicksand ( DMG  88), while a sudden sinkhole is treated as a 20-foot-deep (or even deeper) pit trap that cannot be reset. MAGICAL HAZARDS The prevalence of magic in a fantasy city produces unnatural dangers unique to that environment. Alchemical Fog: Alchemical and magical experi- mentation and item creation frequently involve burning and boiling various substances. On dry, windless days, the fumes released by these processes accumulate in pockets of alchemical fog. A fog might cover only a single building or city block, or it might spread across entire districts.  A creature that enters an alchemical fog must attempt a DC 12 Fortitude save, with an additional save every 24 hours spent within the fog. Success means no physical impairment other than an annoying cough. On a failure, t h e  c r e a t u r e  i s  s i c k e n e d  f o r  2 4  h o u r s .  I f  a  c r e a t u r e  i s  sickened by the fog for a number of consecutive days equal to its Constitution modiﬁ  er (minimum 1), it takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage each consecutive day it remains sickened. An alchemical fog can last for days or, rarely, weeks or months. Roll 1d10: On a result of 1–9, the fog remains for that many days. On a result of 10, roll again and add that result to 10. (Continue rerolling as long as the die keeps coming up 10.) The fog’s duration also depends on if the weather remains dry and calm. Should a strong wind arise or a storm blow in, the fog dissipates regardless of the predetermined duration. Alchemical Rain:  Sometimes the fumes that create an alchemical fog rise into the upper atmosphere, result- ing in alchemical rain. The ﬁ  rst rain after an alchemical fog is dispersed is usually an alchemical rain, but such a phenomenon can occur without warning.  The dissolved substances in alchemical rain are highly caustic: An y creature or object caught in an  alchemical rain takes 1 point of damage per round on a cumulative basis—1 point of damage in the first round, 2 points in the second, 3 points in the third, and so forth. Thus, a lengthy alchemical rain can eventually damage even objects that have reasonably high hardness. Alchemical rains are usually brief, but sometimes can last for several minutes. Roll 1d10: On a result of 1–9, the rain falls for that many rounds. On a result of 10, roll again and add that result to 10. (Continue rerolling as long as the die keeps coming up 10.) Arcane Pollution (CR 5):  Arcane pollution is a rare phenomenon that occurs in and near wizards’ colleges and arcane laboratories. In a 60-foot radius around a central point, the atmosphere is tainted by magi-cal residue and the effluvia of arcane experiments, 620_95386_Ch1.indd   32620_95386_Ch1.indd   32 8/21/06   4:48:42 PM8/21/06   4:48:42 PM33CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY producing random spell effects. A creature entering an area of arcane pollution must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid its effects. On a failure, roll 1d20 and consult the following table; the creature is targeted by the listed effect. Arcane Pollution Effects d20 Spell Effect * 1   Baleful polymorph (up to Small animal or Small vermin only) 2–3 Gain spell resistance 14 for 4d20 minutes 4–6 Change to random color for 4d20 minutes 7–9 Confusion 10–11 Deep slumber 12 Targeted dispel magic 13 Displacement 14 Enervation 15 Enlarge person 16 Haste 17 Hold person 18 Reduce person 19 Slow 20 Teleport (1d10 miles, random direction) * If a spell effect requires a saving throw, the DC is 13 + spell level. Each spell has a default caster level of 10th. An antimagic field  s u p p r e s s e s  t h e  e f f e c t  o f  a r c a n e pollution. Arcane pollution can be destroyed with a suc- cessful dispel magic  check (DC 10 + the level of the spell effect). Unless the pollution is suppressed or destroyed, it remains in place permanently. Black Mold (CR 4): Black mold is an insidious sub- stance that can produce citywide epidemics without any readily apparent source. Black mold can appear anywhere within 1 mile of a major source of magical energy or alchemical fumes—in other words, almost anywhere in a city. This mold usually grows in 5-foot-square patches. It favors corners and shadowy areas, requiring a successful DC 15 Search or Spot check to detect. Living creatures within 30 feet of black mold must succeed on a DC 1 4 Fortitude save or contract mindﬁ  re (DMG  292). They must repeat this save for every 24 hours of exposure, even if the ﬁ  rst save was successful. Physical contact with black mold deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage as well as requiring a save to avoid the disease. Direct sunlight renders black mold dormant. Fire and remove disease destroy it. Necrotic Miasma (CR 3+):  Sometimes a city’s magical residue combines with the psychic anguish of the victims of violent crimes. This necrotic miasma lingers in an alleyway or building, causing the area or structure itself to consume life energy. Such locations are often the source of local haunting tales, because undead tend to congregate there.Arcane pollution comes in many varieties—and baleful polymorph is one of the worstIllus. by E. Widermann 620_95386_Ch1.indd   33620_95386_Ch1.indd   33 8/21/06   4:48:50 PM8/21/06   4:48:50 PM34 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY  A living creature takes 1d6 points of damage every round when it is inside a building or an area tainted by necrotic miasma. A successful DC 12 Fortitude save halves this damage; this save must be repeated in each round that exposure continues. Damage can manifest as a feeling of weakness and pain, or wounds might open on the subject’s ﬂ  esh. This is a necromantic death effect, and is thwarted by death ward  and similar protec- tions. Undead in the area beneﬁ  t as from the effect of a desecrate  spell. A consecrate  spell suppresses the effect of necrotic miasma, and hallow  removes the hazard entirely. Nothing else works; even if an affected structure is destroyed, the necrotic miasma still lingers in the area.City Districts Most cities are divided into districts. The decision to create districts might occur during the planning stages of a city, with an eye to accommodating specific s t r u c t u r e s  a n d  f u n c t i o n s .  I n  m a n y  c a s e s ,  d i s t r i c t s  grow from habit: The wealthy favor the area with the best views and greatest security, while tanners and butchers and alchemists end up far downwind of the general populace. A district might be a single neighborhood or city block, or it might encompass a large area. Districts have their own purposes or identities. Some contain similar types of buildings, such as a waterfront or shop district. Others, such as a lord’s keep or a garrison, are single buildings or complexes with large numbers of residents and staff. A district can contain as few as several dozen people, or pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsBUILDING AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS The entries in this section make frequent references to concepts such as “fine lodging” or “exotic trade.” Examples and defini-tions of each are provided here.",

If such is the case, the presence of that power center need not affect the power center of the city as a whole.

Typically, a small city has up to two independent power centers, a large city up to three, and a metropolis up to four. If a district can have a power center, its type is identi- ﬁ ed as on DMG  137: conventional, magical, nonstandard, or monstrous.

This estate might be a single mas-sive house or a complex of buildings. It contains the living quarters of the city’s ruler, offices and meeting chambers, and often a parade ground or ceremonial gathering place for public addresses. The lord’s keep is also often, though not always, the location of the city’s highest court. Citizens with no official business are usually turned away unless they are invited or come as petitioners. The estate grounds are meticulously kept and usually feature large gardens, luxurious fountains, hedge mazes, and the like. People are clad in the latest fashions, and carriages are as common as pedestrians. The air smells relatively fresh here. In most cases, the lord’s estate has not only its own defenses but also an independent source of water, enabling it to withstand a short siege even if the city should fall.

Surrounded by tenements and cheap lodging, the center of the slave quarter contains pens or cells, and a platform from which slavers display their wares. (In cities where slavery is illegal, this district might instead be under-ground, or within a closed structure in a red-light or slum district.) On casual observation, this looks just like any other impoverished district. Only a closer examination discerns the occasional noble or noble’s servant, or the cartloads of prisoners or war captives being readied for sale. The normal sounds of the hard-working poor are punctuated by occasional cries of pain or despair. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCOMMUNITY WEALTH While the Dungeon Master’s Guide gives guidelines for determin- ing the assets available in a city, as well as the maximum value for any given item, not all items are available in all districts. More expensive items are impossible to find in all but the richest districts, and little ready cash exists in a poor district. The fol- lowing table presents the gp limit for items purchased in various districts, based on social class. GP Limit by Social Class —— GP Limit in: ——Social Class Small City Large City MetropolisUpper 15,000 40,000 100,000Middle 6,000 16,000 40,000Lower 1,500 4,000 10,000 To determine the amount of ready cash available in a dis-trict, multiply the population of the district by the appropri- ate number on the table below. These numbers assume that about 40% of a city’s ready cash is concentrated in the upper-class districts, though these represent only 10–18% of its total districts. About 50% of the city’s assets are in its middle-class districts, and the remaining 10% are in its lower-class districts.Asset Multiplier by Social Class —— Asset Multiplier in: ——Social Class Small City Large City MetropolisUpper 4,000 7,500 16,000Middle 1,500 3,500 9,000Lower 150 350 800 Most cities are made up primarily of lower-class districts, though in larger cities, the upper class increases while the lower class shrinks, as shown on the table below. In addition, upper-class districts are less densely populated than less wealthy ones. Social Class Neighborhoods by City Size City Size Upper Class Middle Class Lower ClassSmall city 10% 30% 60%Large city 15% 30% 55%Metropolis 18% 30% 52% A particularly wealthy city might have more upper- and middle-class districts and fewer lower-class districts, while a poor city would be the opposite. A city heavily engaged in trade would have a larger middle class than one that is mostly isolated and self-sufficient.  Generally, districts of the same social class adjoin each other. In some cases, one or two adjacent districts have a social class one step higher or lower than the others. Very rarely, upper-class and lower-class districts exist side by side. In such cases, they are separated by some geographical or artificial feature, such as a small cliff, a river, or a wall. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   46620_95386_Ch1.indd   46 8/21/06   4:50:51 PM8/21/06   4:50:51 PM47CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF",

Alternatively, characters might be petrified or subjected to multiple negative levels. In such a case, it’s off to the temple for assistance. The information in this sidebar is designed to help you, as the DM, make a trip to the healer into a roleplaying experience. To run a trip to the healer, first check the NPC Healer Prices table for the basic expense. Then choose options for the temple and the healer and, if you wish, select an extenuating circum-stance to make the service less expensive for the PCs.  You can generate a healer randomly if you wish by rolling d% and consulting the tables below, or you can just pick whatever options you like. A sample healer’s class and level are just sug-gestions; feel free to adapt them to your city. Sample Temples d% Details01–30  Dominant Temple: This massive edifice is one of the best-known landmarks in the city—in a theocracy, it might be the center of government. PCs who seek healing magic must first speak to one or more temple bureaucrats before they get an audience with a healer who can help them. 31–50  Minor Temple: This temple has some local prominence, but it’s ﬁ  guratively (and sometimes literally) in the shadows of larger, more popular temples. PCs can usually see a healer right away, expecially if they arrive injured or carrying corpses. 51–65  Clandestine Sect: These worshipers keep to themselves either because their deity demands secrecy or because they have the enmity of another power in the city. Their temples are often disguised as other sorts of buildings or hidden by secret doors or illusion magic. 66–80  Forgotten Shrine: The healer is devoted to a deity or cause that few venerate anymore. Such shrines are often in out-of-the-way parts of the city or even beyond its walls. 81–100  Wandering Missionary: This healer regards every street corner and marketplace as a potential spot for worship and sermonizing. The PCs might find the healer in the bazaar one day, in the slums another day, and just outside the city gates on a third day.NPC Healer Prices MinimumMalady Spell Class/Level Base CostDeath  Raise dead Cleric 9  5,450 gp Incomplete  Resurrection Cleric 13  10,910 gp corpse  No corpse  True resurrection Cleric 17  26,530 gp Energy drain Restoration Cleric 7,  380 gp paladin 14 Negative levels  Greater  Cleric 13 3,410 gp restoration Ability damage Restoration Cleric 7,  380 gp or drain  paladin 14 Curse  Break  Bard 10, 450 gp enchantment  cleric 9, (doesn’t always  paladin 14, work) sorcerer 10, wizard 9 Remove curse Bard 7, cleric 5, 280 gp paladin 11, sorcerer 8, wizard 7 Disease  Remove disease Cleric 5,  280 gp druid 5, ranger 11 Petrification  Break  Bard 10, 450 gp enchantment  cleric 9, (doesn’t always  paladin 14, work) sorcerer 10, wizard 9 Stone to flesh Sorcerer 12,  660 gp wizard 11 620_95386_Ch2.indd   62620_95386_Ch2.indd   62 8/22/06   9:14:16 AM8/22/06   9:14:16 AM63CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERmovement horizontally in this fashion (so long as the wall is wide enough ), even if that distance, plus your falling distance, exceeds your normal movement rate.

Greater Invocation Devil’s Whispers:  As sugges- tion, plus subject believes his actions were his own idea.INVOCATION DESCRIPTIONS These new invocations are intended for use by warlocks (see Complete Arcane ) who spend substantial time in an urban environment. COCOON OF REFUSE Least; 1st You cause various bits of trash and detritus in an area—loose wood, rot- ting garbage, old clothes, discarded dishes, scraps of parchment, even dead animals—to fly about and latch onto a single target creature. If the target fails a Reflex save, he is entangled . The subject can escape with a successful DC 20 Strength or Escape Artist check, which can be repeated in every round as a standard action. The invocation ends when the target successfully escapes, or after 1 round per caster level. This invocation requires that at least 50% of the refuse be urban trash, so it does not function in the wilderness. Creatures of Huge or larger size are immune to this invocation.DEVIL’S WHISPERS Greater; 5th You can use a suggestion  effect, as the spell. Additionally, when the d ura ti o n  e n d s  o r  th e  tas k  is  co m -pleted, the subject must attempt a second Will save with a –5 penalty. If this second save fails, the subject completely forgets that you were the one who suggested the course of action mandated by the use of devil’s whispers , instead becoming convinced that it was his own idea—even if he’s not certain why he might have chosen to perform such an action. A successful break enchantment  spell can rid him of this delusion, but dispel magic  and similar effects cannot. You can have a number of devil’s whispers active at any one time equal to your Charisma modiﬁ  er (minimum 1). Devil’s whispers  is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. THIEVES’ BANE Lesser; 3rd So named for the people who most commonly suffer its effects, this invocation allows you to make a deadly trap of an ordinary door. You can produce a hold portal  effect, as the spell. In addition, should anyone other than you open the ensorceled portal from the outside by any means (including knock  or dispel magic spells) before the spell’s duration expires, the portal (or a large por- tion thereof) instantly explodes outward, dealing 5d6 points of damage to all within 20 feet of the door on that side. Creatures standing on the inside of the door are unaffected. Each creature but the one that trig- gered the effect (assuming it was standing in front of the door) can attempt a Reﬂ  ex save for half damage. Spell resistance does not apply to the damage caused by this effect. Thieves’ bane turns a door into a trapIllus. by C.

Whether their power is political, financial, criminal, or social, these groups can make valuable allies—or potent enemies—to enterprising adventurers. When used to their fullest extent, they can shape the course of an entire campaign. City Government The most important (or at least the most fundamental) “faction” at work in most cities is the local government. R e g a r d l e s s  o f  i t s  s o u r c e  o r  s t ru c t u r e ,  t h e  g o v e r n m e n t forms the context in which all other systems—from guilds to churches to private organizations—must function. In some cases, the government moderates the growth and influence of such groups, ensuring that no one private entity ever outshines the rest. In other instances (particularly regimes where corruption runs high) the government is a merely a means to an end for these special interests—or worse, an insigniﬁ  cant factor in their daily operations, lacking either the power or motivation to curb their inﬂ  uence.POLITICAL SYSTEMS Two comparable cities, each of similar size, population, and demographic distribution, might still feel very dif- ferent from one another if their governments operate differently. What follows is a look at how the average city runs under each of the most common forms of government in a fantasy world. (For more on the default political systems, see DMG  140.) THE AUTOCRATIC CITY Since the monarchy is the most common politi-cal structure in a fantasy setting, the autocratic city is the most commonly encountered type of urban center (with the possible exception of the feudal city, below). Cities under a monarchy tend to reinforce the principles behind their ruler, including the centralization of power, the importance of noble birth, and the endorse- ment of the rich–poor divide. Members of the working class do their best to muddle through their daily routines, with the occasional appeal to the local ruler (or their neighborhood repre- sentative, if one exists) to improve their lot in life. The gentry, on the other hand, try to balance their pride and dignity with taking whatever 69Illus. by D. BirchamIllus. by D.

In an autocratic city, only the local ruler and those whom he favors know lives of luxury. Regardless of how man y branches and ag encies do the day-to-day work of making the city function, the autocratic city is ultimately ruled by a single individual. If the city is the capital of a nation or an empire, that i n d i v i d u a l  c o u l d  w e l l  b e  t h e  k i n g / q u e e n  o r  o t h e r  national regent; few rulers care to delegate authority within their own demesnes. In cities outside the capital, the local monarch is likely a governor, appointed by or on behalf of the national monarch. A ruler might well maintain his share of aides, including chamberlains, chancellors, and even a parliamentary council, but at the end of the day, he is indisputably in charge. In good- and neutral-aligned cities, the governor typically rules by virtue of noble blood (whether deserving or not) and does his best to keep the people content, even if all that effort involves is distracting them from their complaints. In evil cities, the governor rules by possess- ing the might and inﬂ  uence to retain control, with the power—either appointed or assumed—to crush those who resist his decrees. THE DEMOCRATIC CITY If the autocratic city is the most common type of fan-tasy metropolis, then the democratic city is the rarest. D e m o c r a t i c  c i t i e s  t a k e  a  g r e a t  d e a l  o f  k n o w - h o w  a n d  cooperation in order to function, and many end up col-lapsing under their own weight. (Whatever else might be said of autocracies, they can certainly sustain them-selves, especially in a medieval setting.) Cities making a go of true democracy buzz constantly with activity, as people run to and fro to keep the wheels turning. Few individuals live lives of indulgence in a democracy, but just as few go hungry. A  d e m o c r a t i c  c i t y  d i f f e r e n t i a t e s  i t s e l f  f r o m  o t h e r models in a number of ways: mainly that it is generally ruled by a single group rather than a single person. Most often, this ruling group is a council composed of elected representatives from the city’s various wards, guilds, or districts. A democratic city often retains its local focus even if it is also a capital city. If the larger government is similarly democratic, then the city likely hosts a senate (or similar congress), but in any republic, the operation of a city must remain separate from the administration of a nation. As such, in democratic capital cities, one often ﬁ  nds the council working side by side with a separate and distinct national govern-ment. Democratic cities generally flourish only in good-aligned regions, where the communal desire to reach consensus has a chance to overpower humanity’s natural divisiveness. Evil-aligned democratic cities are rare in the extreme.THE FEUDAL CITY The feudal city is usually similar to the autocratic city in its basic operation; that is, it is often the product of a monocratic national system. The primary difference lies in how the local government takes shape. As with an autocratic city, a single individual (a duke or similar landed noble) usually governs a feudal city. He or she rules it as part of a personal fief, and is beholden in turn to a higher liege (usually the king). Technically speaking, the duke rules his or her own lands on political behalf of another, who is the ultimate arbiter in matters of law and policy (since the fiefdom lies within the boundaries of the superior’s domain). Feudal cities are further distinguished by the size and complexity of the resident nobility, many of whom are landed gentry in their own right (having been ceded territory by the local duke). In this regard, feudal cities are generally “healthier” than truly autocratic cities, since the size and influence of the middle class is substantially larger. Between the royal family, the landed nobility, the gentry, the church, and the working class, the feudal city displays almost as much complexity as the democratic city. The highest-ranking noble has the final word on matters of state, of course, but the governing family—no matter how wealthy or influen- tial—doesn’t exist in a vacuum, making a feudal city the perfect environment for thorny and scandalous high-society intrigue. Complicating matters further, feudal cities typically have strong parliaments—either assisting the ruler in governing or legislating policy in their own right—made up of other landed nobles. As such, the city’s ruler must spend much time and effort courting the favor of the other nobles, regardless of (or because of) the fact that his authority technically outstrips their own. By its very deﬁ  nition, the feudal city is almost never a capital. If the king is in residence, he has no need of a duke or other sworn representative, making it an autocratic city by default. Feudal cities exhibit align- ments of every sort, though good- and neutral-aligned communities still make up the majority. Evil-aligned feudal cities are hotbeds of backstabbing scandal and intrigue of every variety. THE MAGOCRATIC CITY Despite the strong presence of magic in most fantasy settings, magocracies remain extremely rare. Even in high-magic campaigns, few areas produce more than a handful of powerful arcane spellcasters, and only a tiny number would willingly forgo their lives of quiet study to embrace dreams of political dominance. Magocracies are substantially more common, however, in regions dominated by nonhumans (particularly 620_95386_Ch3.indd   70620_95386_Ch3.indd   70 8/22/06   9:19:04 AM8/22/06   9:19:04 AM71CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERthose with strong arcane traditions, such as the drow and other elf races). When they do occur, magocratic cities are marvels to behold, demonstrating a public embrace of magic as a means by which the city can be designed and run. The primary drawback of such a system, of course, is that nonspellcasters face severely limited lives. Technically speaking, magocratic cities are oligar-chies—political systems in which all power lies in the hands of a small ruling elite. As a result, mago-cratic cities resem ble tribal cities in that they tend  to flourish when the power of the local government doesn’t reach beyond the city’s immediate surround-ings. Councils of wizards can administer small areas with little difficulty but tend to falter when trying to preside over massive swaths of territory. The only circumstance in which the system works on a large s c a l e  i s  w h e n  i t  c o m b i n e s  w i t h  t h e  f e u d a l  s y s t e m ,  using a complex web of interconnected but indepen-dent governing lords, bound by magical might or focus rather than by noble blood. Magocratic cities r a r e l y  a p p e a r  i n  g o o d - a l i g n e d  r e g i o n s ,  s i n c e  t h e i r  oligarchic structure keeps the populace divided, but are relatively common in neutral-aligned cities that stand independent from any higher authority. Evil- aligned magocratic cities are despotic nightmares, in which life for the common folk is both meticulously monitored and rigidly controlled. THE THEOCRATIC CITY A theocratic city is similar to a magocratic city; it is governed by a religious elite instead of a spellcasting elite, but the two are otherwise very much alike. Unlike magocracies, however, theocracies are relatively com-monplace in the fantasy world. Due to the power of the gods, which can actually be seen and felt thanks to the gifts of divine magic, the masses might embrace religion on an overwhelming scale—leading some areas to forgo traditional forms of government in favor of theocracies. In addition, unlike magocracies, one needn’t be an actual cleric or other divine spellcaster in order to join the ruling elite; so long as one holds sufﬁ  cient rank within the church (appropriate levels in aristocrat or even expert will do), one can garner enough support to function effectively within a theocratic system. These forms of government usually leave little room for guessing as to who is in charge, and religious iconography appears in every shop and street corner. People in such cities often want for little, but woe betide any nonbeliever. . . . Theocracies, like magocracies, are technically oligar- chies, since all power lies in the hands of a select few. Each theocracy varies depending on the particulars of their faith, however, so the actual administration of city affairs runs the gamut in theocratic cities. So m e  tak e  a  m o r e  d e ta ch e d  a p p r o a ch ,  all o win g  f o r  the creation of parliaments and other civic agencies, while others demand absolute control (or at least direct oversight) over every aspect of daily life. Unlike magocracies, which tend to localize their influence, theocracies often spread as far and wide as possible. S o m e  o f  t h e  m o s t  p o w e r f u l  a n d  l o n g e s t - l a s t i n g regimes in history have been theocracies; such dynas- ties end only in the face of popular revolt, or because of intervention from outside forces. Theocratic cities resemble feudal cities in that they can appear in regions dominated by every possible alignment, th o ugh expansio nist th eocraci es t e n d t o surface in  areas where evil predominates. THE TRIBAL CITY A tribal city has much in common with an autocratic city, and depending on the structure of the ruling clan, a feudal city as well. Power lies with a local chief, who might or might not answer to a higher chieftain of his own. As a rule, the tribal structure only works well on a small scale; like communism, the farther it spreads, the shakier its foundation becomes. The intriguing exception to this, like the magocratic city, comes with nonhuman communities. Indeed, some humanoid races (particularly the so-called races of savagery, such as goblins, orcs, and the like) understand only a tribal structure, and can extend its efficiency to include entire kingdoms, each ruled by a supreme tribal chieftain. The look and operation of a tribal city depends on the tribe in power, of course, and to a lesser extent on the mix of races and cultures over which the tribe rules. Savage tribes tend to demonstrate their power and dominance at every turn, festooning the streets with heads on spikes and similar decorations, while more cultured tribes merely try to make the city an honest reflection of themselves. No matter what the nature of the ruling tribe, however, those outside its membership—or worse yet, members of a rival tribe—will find life difficult in the extreme. The larger it gets, the more a tribal city takes on the aspects of a feudal city. Because a ruling clan or family can only oversee so much on its own, it must eventually rely on the input and support of other families to govern. Indeed, tribal cities often grow to become metropolises when a powerful tribe gathers neighboring tribes to its banner, and either subsumes them into itself (thus creating a tribal system of nobility) or rules over them with their support. The greatest and most successful tribal regimes keep the values of their people—ties of faith, blood, ancestry, and belief—in mind at every turn during their expansion and growth. A united 620_95386_Ch3.indd   71620_95386_Ch3.indd   71 8/22/06   9:19:08 AM8/22/06   9:19:08 AM72 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERtribe is a powerful thing to behold, no matter what its culture is. Tribal cities are typically associated with (and primarily encountered in) areas on the so-called “edge of civilization.” This is only a stereotype, how-ever, and some of the largest and most self-sustaining metropolises follow a variant of the tribal structure. A tribal city usually falls when it faces internal dissent or revolt, and it tends to go down hard—often taking the entire populace with it in blood-soaked conﬂ  ict. Tribal cities are a close step behind feudal cities and theocratic cities in that they can appear in regions dominated by every possible alignment. Despite this, the preponderance of tribal fantasy cities are either neutral or evil. POLITICAL POSITIONS The fantasy city wears myriad cultural faces, but the default setting of the D\u0026D game presupposes a Western European style; the following information is tailored to ﬁ t such a setting. Most of these positions can be found in areas and cultures that don’t ﬁ  t this standard; they simply need a different name and a slight adjustment to their ﬂ  avor to better suit the campaign. An Egyptian- themed setting, for example, might not have mayors in its urban centers but appropriate equivalents (in this case, nomarchs). Mayor Regardless of the national government above them, most major settlements in the urban fantasy world have a mayor, or a closely analogous ﬁ  gure. The position typi- cally originates among the people—often in an attempt to bring more governmental involvement to their own lives (since they themselves elect someone to this posi-tion). A mayor is the most public face of a city’s politics, and although the ofﬁ  ce-holder is usually selected by the people, he or she often remains fully beholden to the local government.
