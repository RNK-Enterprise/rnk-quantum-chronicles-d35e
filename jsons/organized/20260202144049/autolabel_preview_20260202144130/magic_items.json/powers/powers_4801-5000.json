Immunity to Magic (Ex): An incarnum golem is immune to the effect of any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A dispel evil, dispel good, dispel chaos, dispel law, or dismissal spell resets an incarnum golem’s adaptive attack bonus to +0 and dazes the creature for 1 round. A banishment spell also resets an incarnum golem’s adaptive attack bonus but dazes the golem for 1d4+1 rounds. While the golem is dazed by either of these effects, its fast healing ability is suppressed. Construction An incarnum golem’s body must be sculpted from adaman- tine, iron, and plates of magically hardened glass. These materials cost a total of 7,500 gp. Creating the body requires a DC 15 Craft (sculpting) check.

Summoning Souleaters An evil spellcaster who knows the summon monster VII spell can choose to permanently remove the huge fi endish monstrous scorpion from the list of creatures that he can summon either with summon monster VII or with higher-level summoning spells. If he does so, he can replace it with the souleater. Once the spellcaster learns higher-level summon- ing spells, he can use them to summon multiple souleaters if he has chosen this option. SOULFUSED CONSTRUCT In rare situations, raw incarnum can bond with non sentient animated matter—such as the body of a construct—and imbue it with a semblance of life. The soul energy of the incarnum becomes, in essence, the now-living construct’s spirit, granting it a modicum of sentience and free will. A soulfused construct typically understands Common or another humanoid language (such as Dwarven, Elven, or Orc) but cannot speak or write unless it pays skill points for the Speak Language skill.

Imagine that incarnum has always been a part of your A further twist is that neither organization is clearly good world, but its mysteries are hidden away in dusty tomes or evil. The Society of the Learned is motivated primarily by buried in ancient libraries, awaiting discovery by a group of a thirst for knowledge. Many scholars among its ranks seek explorers or treasure seekers. Incarnum occasionally makes this knowledge for benevolent reasons or just for knowledge’s its presence known, but few possess the understanding required to distinguish an incarnum wraith from a more mundane wraith or to differentiate the lost from the simply mad or possessed. Azurins are occasionally born among human societies, and travelers sometimes return from far- ranging expeditions with descriptions of skarns and rilkans, but meldshaping remains virtually unknown. In recent years, a cabal of erudite scholars has developed an interest in these widely scattered but apparently related phenomena. This cabal, known as the Society of the Learned, begins a scholarly campaign to uncover the secrets of incar- num and handsomely pays adventuring parties who bring them tomes containing such secrets. Unfortunately, the actions of the Society bring them (and the PCs, if they undertake missions at the Society’s behest) into confl ict with a secretive order of meldshapers known as the Azure Sentinels. This tiny organization has actively preserved the knowledge of incarnum from ancient times down to the present, while going to great lengths to keep that knowledge utterly secret from anyone outside its own membership. Members of the Sentinels include incarnates posing as clerics within religious orders and soulborn hiding within orders of knights and paladins, as well as umbral disciples and witchborn binders who serve as assassins for the order. Quickly noticing the increased efforts of the Society of the Learned, the Azure Sentinels step up their own efforts to keep this knowledge out of the hands of outsiders, and they begin offering their own bounties for ancient tomes. 662200__8888557799__CChhpp88..iinndddd 220011 77//1122//0055 99::2266::5566 AAMM 202 8 RETPAHC MUNRACNI SNGIAPMAC own sake, although some do seek power for their own evil plane.

The barrage continues for 1 round. During this time the targets are blinded and must make Concentration checks (DC 15 + spell level) to cast spells. 28–31 The spell affects a random target or area. The DM should randomly choose a different target from among those in range of the spell or center the spell at a random place within range of the spell.

Multiply the result by 5 feet for close range spells, 20 feet for medium range spells, or 80 feet for long range spells. 32–35 The spell functions normally, but any material compo- nents are not consumed.

Certain are coterminous to the Astral Plane. In the D\u0026D cosmology, all spells (or spell-like abilities, or other powers such as psionics) planes are coterminous to the Astral Plane, so there would be may be able to twist and morph the astral haze, similar to the way little difficulty in utilizing such abilities. But if the Astral Plane the substance of shadow is manipulated by shadow spells such is separate from other planes in your cosmology, then such as shadow conjuration. It’s possible to invent spells for your abilities do not function there. cosmology that affect the Astral Plane in this fashion. pqqqqrs • Enhanced Magic:All spells and spell-like abilities used within the astral may be employed as if they were improved by the Quicken Spell feat. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round. ASTRAL LINKS The Astral Plane is omnipresent and can potentially have links to every other plane in your cosmology. You can restrict the Astral Plane’s connection to particular planes (see the Option: Without the Astral sidebar), but in gen- eral the Astral Plane connects everywhere. Many individuals pass through the Astral Plane without realizing it when they cast certain spells or use interplanar portals. They find themselves on the Astral Plane only when something goes wrong, such as a badly cast dimension doorspell or a bag of holdingstuffed inside a portable hole. When something has to go somewhere else but has no other direction to go, it usually ends up on the Astral Plane. There can be permanent portals between various planes and the Astral Plane. Outsiders that otherwise lack plane- traveling abilities use these portals to get to the Astral Plane. A number of openings known as color pools connect the Astral Plane to other planes. Color pools are irregular disks of a particular color floating in the vastness of the Astral Plane. The color of the pool tells the astral traveler what plane is on the other end of the color pool. Seven out of every ten color pools are one-way portals leading only to the plane in question. The remaining three out of ten allow two-way access. The astral projectionspell still connects through such color pools regardless of their direction, so an individual moving onto a new plane can still retreat to the Astral Plane through a one-way portal. Portals that pass through the Astral Plane to other planes form conduits, which appear as large trails of dark gray against the astral sky. Travelers can reach a particular location on another plane by latching onto one of these conduits and following it to one of its destinations, although this can be a perilous way to travel. Conduits flex and weave as they move through the Astral Plane, and successfully catching one of them is akin to hitching a ride on a tornado. Grabbing a conduit requires a Will saving throw (DC 20). Failure means the individual is flung violently away from the conduit and takes 1d10 points of damage from the astral turbulence. Success indicates that the traveler has latched onto the conduit and moves instantly onto one of the two planes the conduit connects. Conduits tend to flow either in one direction or the other, but they do not change their direction of flow frequently, so individuals who hitch a ride on a conduit in quick succes- sion wind up on the same plane. An astral form that joins a conduit forms a new body at the destination plane. The advantage of using a conduit is that the traveler likely has a way back out of the destination plane. The dis- advantage is that it’s impossible to tell by looking where a conduit is coming from or where it’s going. Conduits are :5 RETPAHC EVITISNART EHT SENALP AAssttrraall CCoolloorr PPoooollss CCeelleessttiiaa BByyttooppiiaa EEllyyssiiuumm TThhee BBeeaassttllaannddss AArrbboorreeaa YYssggaarrdd LLiimmbboo PPaannddeemmoonniiuumm TThhee AAbbyyssss CCaarrcceerrii TThhee GGrraayy WWaassttee GGeehheennnnaa TThhee NNiinnee HHeellllss AAcchheerroonn MMeecchhaannuuss AArrccaaddiiaa TThhee OOuuttllaannddss MMaatteerriiaall PPllaannee EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff FFiirree EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff EEaarrtthh EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff WWaatteerr EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff AAiirr PPoossiittiivvee EEnneerrggyy PPllaannee NNeeggaattiivvee EEnneerrggyy PPllaannee PPllaannee ooff SShhaaddooww EEtthheerreeaall DDeemmiippllaanneess ((VVaarriieess)) 48 often used by astral travelers who have no other means of Traveling Elsewhere: If an astral form passes through transportation and need to get off the Astral Plane quickly. a color pool or otherwise manifests on another plane, it forms a new body from the building blocks of the plane Table 5–1: Random Color Pools for the D\u0026D itself.

An eerie howling increases with each round, and with a brutal suddenness the ether cyclone tears at everything in its path. Travelers can flee the ether cyclone by moving onto the coexistent plane or seeking shelter. Spells with the force descriptor, such as Leomund’s tiny hut, protect the traveler from the effects of an ether cyclone, but weather spells such as control wind andcontrol weatherhave no effect on an ether cyclone. It’s otherwise impossible to outrun an ether cyclone. One of the greatest dangers of an ether cyclone is how it can scatter a group of adventurers, leaving them unable to find each other—or to find exits from the Ethereal Plane. At the DM’s option, roll only once on the table below for a group of travelers, provided they are relatively close to each other when the ether cyclone strikes.

Pandemonium’s petitioners have the following special petitioner traits: PANDEMONIUM TRAITS Pandemonium has the following traits. • Objective Directional Gravity: In the cavernous tun- nels of Pandemonium, gravity is oriented toward what- ever wall a creature is nearest. Thus, there is no normal concept of floor, wall and ceiling—any surface is a floor if you’re near enough to it. Rare narrow tunnels exactly cancel out gravity, allowing a traveler to shoot through them at incredible speed. The layer of Phlegethon is an exception—there the normal gravity trait applies. • NormalTime. • Infinite Size: Pandemonium goes on forever, although its well-known realms are bounded. • Divinely Morphic: Specific powerful beings such as the deity Erythnul can alter Pandemonium. Ordinary creatures find Pandemonium indistinguishable from the Material Plane (the alterable morphic trait, in other words). Spells and physical effort affect Pande- monium normally. • No Elemental or Energy Traits. • Mildly Chaos-Aligned: Lawful characters on the plane of Pandemonium suffer a –2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. • Normal Magic.

Also, the headwaters of the Styx well up from the topmost layer of Pandemonium. PANDEMONIUM INHABITANTS Pandemonium is probably the least inhabited of all the Outer Planes.
