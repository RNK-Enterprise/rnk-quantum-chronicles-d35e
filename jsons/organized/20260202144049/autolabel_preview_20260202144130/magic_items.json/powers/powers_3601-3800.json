Tchkarthu desires to gain the power to command beholders as a hive mother does, and given its resources, it might just fi nd what it seeks. LAIRS A typical beholder lair consists of a winding maze of passageways bored through solid rock with disintegrate eye rays. These tunnels tend to be perfectly smooth and round, with a 10- foot radius. Beholders know that their ability to fl y gives them a dis- tinct tactical advantage, so most lairs incorporate a large number of vertical shafts. This hinders intrud- ers attempting to penetrate the lair and keeps prisoners from easily escaping. A typical lair consists of three to fi ve additional chambers. The far- thest chamber from the entrance is the beholder’s personal quarters, where the creature sleeps and studies any magic treasure it has accumulated. Beholders are too arrogant to incorporate escape tunnels into their quarters; doing so only invites an invasion on multiple fronts. In any case, a beholder can quickly create its own escape tunnel, if need be, with its disintegrate eye ray. Between the 50 TYRANTS THE EYE CHAPTER 3 quarters and the lair entrance are two or more chambers these cases, a beholder employs charmed gatherers—creatures used to house guardians. Most beholders keep another room capable of traversing great distances quickly and penetrating off to the side of the main complex to dispose of waste or to secure sites with ease. A beholder sends a spy to determine hold prisoners.
