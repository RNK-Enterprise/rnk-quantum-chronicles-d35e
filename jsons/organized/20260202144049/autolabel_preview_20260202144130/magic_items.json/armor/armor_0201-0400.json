In addition, if the wearer has a familiar, any pouch can hold it no matter what its size or weight. The familiar has no need for food, water, or air while inside the pouch, but any other living creature of suitable size placed within a pocket has enough air for only 1 minute, after which it suffocates.

Contract of Nepthas: Easily mistaken for a scroll if found as treasure, this item is actually a magical contract , usually contained in an ivory tube and scribed in black ink on golden-brown vellum. The details of the contract are blank, and the user can ﬁ ll it in with any instructions, agreement, or conditions he cares to create. When the contract is signed, though, the item ’s true power is revealed to both parties, and any signatory who breaks the contract is subject to a curse that strikes it blinded, deafened, and mute (no saving throw, though spell resistance applies). The curse of a contract of Nepthas  can be removed only by means of remove curse  cast by an 8th-level spellcaster or a break enchantment  spell (DC 25). Because a contract typically involves two parties agreeing on a set of conditions, nonspeci ﬁ c terms might allow a clever signatory to escape them without suffering the contract ’s curse. For example, if an adventurer signs a contract with a king stating that she will slay a dragon in the Northern Hills by the eve of the new moon, the contract is effectively o p e n -e n d e d  b y  virtu e  o f  i t s  n o t  s p e c ifyin g  “the next new moon, ” even if that was both parties ’ meaning and intent.

Its limbs are thick tendrils of water that loosely resemble arms, its body reshaping itself to ﬂ ow across the ground without breaking up or losing its form. Like the other elemental monoliths, water monoliths are the chieftains and leaders of their kind. Generally unwilling to leave the Elemental Plane of Water, they can be summoned only with the most powerful of spells, and though they speak Aquan, water monoliths rarely deign to speak to creatures other than other water elementals. Their voices sound like the crashing of surf in a wild storm, and they are noticeably more intelligent and strong-willed than most of their kind. Combat Water monoliths are almost as strong as earth monoliths, but they are much quicker and more agile. They prefer to ﬁ ght in water, where they can disappear beneath the waves and outmaneuver their foes, but in any instance a water monolith cannot venture more than 300 feet from the body of water from which it was conjured. Drench (Ex): A water monolith ’s touch puts out torches, camp ﬁ res, exposed lanterns, and other open ﬂ ames of non- magical origin of they are Huge or smaller. The creature can dispel magical ﬁ re it touches, as if using greater dispel magic (caster level 20th). Vortex (Su):  A water monolith can transform itself into a whirlpool at will as a standard action, provided it is under-water. It can remain in that form as long as it likes. In vortex form, a monolith can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 10 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The monolith controls the exact height, but it must be at least 20 feet.A water monolith ’s movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the monolith enters the space another creature occupies. Another crea-ture might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the monolith moves into or through the creature ’s space. Huge or smaller creatures take damage when caught in a vortex and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 42 Re ﬂ ex save when it comes into contact with a vortex or take 4d6 points of damage. It must also suc-ceed on a second DC 42 Re ﬂ ex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Re ﬂ ex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based. A creature trapped in a vortex cannot move except to go where the water monolith carries it or to escape the vortex. It can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. A monolith can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will ﬁ t inside the vortex ’s volume.

A summoned monolith always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the vortex ’s base touches the surface beneath a body of water, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex ’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have conceal- ment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. A water monolith in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it. Water Mastery (Ex): A water monolith gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental are touching the ground, the monolith takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls. A water monolith can easily affect the movement of ships in any squares it threatens as a full-round action, overturning any craft up to 180 feet long, or halting and holding motionless a ship as long as 360 feet. Larger ships can be reduced to half speed for as long as they remain threatened by the monolith.",

They are more dif- ﬁ cult to attack in melee and more resistant to being turned, and they gain the ability to cast spells. The process is much more effective when applied to intelligent undead than those that are mindless, since intelligent undead can discharge their spells tactically.

Spellstitched creatures can be created only by a wizard or sorcerer with the Craft Wondrous Item feat and of suf ﬁ cient level to cast the spells to be imbued within the undead ’s body. The creation process takes a number of days equal to the Wisdom score of the undead creature being spellstitched (so a minimum of 10 days) and requires the expenditure of 1,000 gp for carving or tattooing materials in addition to 500 XP × the undead creature ’s Wisdom score.

        "description":  "Operating below the level of the many guilds that exist to regulate and protect arcane spellcasters, a small number of sinister cabals are dedicated to establishing the primacy of arcane spellcasters over all other folk (or, in an antimagocracy, to keeping the persecuted art of free spellcasting alive). Like other types of wizards guilds, secret cabals offer their members collective protection against their enemies, access to magical lore and items, and prospective allies and hirelings. Unlike the open guilds, though, few of these conspiracies openly proclaim their sometimes dark or illicit goals. Societies and Orders Guilds are associations of mages bound by profession, but groups of arcanists often come together for other purposes, creating a unique society or order dedicated to a particular cause. The demeanor and activities of particular societies or orders vary signi ﬁ cantly with their purposes, but because those purposes generally go beyond the simple advancement of arcane knowledge, societies and orders are often less useful than true wizards guilds for acquiring and sharing arcane lore. Arcane orders don ’t normally have special resources such as laboratories or libraries, but neither do they generally charge dues of any sort. Because they have chosen to take up a common cause with their fellows, the members of an order tend to be more than willing to ally with or otherwise assist fellow members (often sharing knowledge and resources on an individual basis). In some cases, arcane spellcasters might belong to a larger society incorporating different classes, often with a speci ﬁ c cultural or political mandate. For example, an elven kingdom might be home to the Knights of the White Arrow, an order of arcane archers and rangers who serve as elite guards and agents to the elven king. Schools and Colleges Becoming an arcanist is rarely as straightforward a process as simply deciding one day to start casting spells. Most arcane characters begin their training as children or young teenagers, spending several years engaged in tedious and difﬁ cult studies before being able to successfully cast even the simplest cantrips. Finding the necessary training in the arcane arts is never easy, and many people who might have become skilled mages never follow the arcane path for lack of any opportunity to learn the fundamental skills. Some sorcerers and wizards apprentice themselves to an older, more experienced spellcaster with the time and patience to instruct them, while others enroll in wizard schools or colleges to obtain a formal education in the magical arts. Wizard colleges run the gamut from royal academies train- ing warmages for the realm ’s armies to private schools where the children of nobles learn to tap the power of the arcane arts; from spontaneous classes for the talented youngsters in an elf community to remote towers in which promising children are evaluated as potential members of a secret arcane order. Some schools require a prince ’s ransom in tuition, while others teach any and all who can demonstrate even minor magical talent. Still others offer instruction in the expectation that young mages will repay their education with years of unquestioning service. Mentors As with any art requiring extensive amounts of training and considerable time to master, the knowledge of magic is often passed from one generation to the next by means of a long apprenticeship. The master –apprentice relationship is a time-honored tradition among arcane spellcasters. As with any more mundane vocation, the challenges of arcane apprenticeship begin with ﬁ nding an experienced mage with an interest in teaching. While few arcanists feel any obligation to take on the task of instructing a neophyte in the ways of magic, most mages (even evil ones) feel at least a vague sense of duty to the arcane arts themselves, and they Aspiring warmages learn from their teacherIllus. by R.

At the same time, even the most willing masters feel enti- tled to seek some compensation for taking on an apprentice, from the mundane (payment in gold to train the daughter of a wealthy merchant) to the in ﬂ uential (gifts of of ﬁ ce or property for mentoring the child of a local lord) to the sinister (the complete and abject servitude of an apprentice from a family otherwise too poor to pay). Evil mages in particular often command the allegiance of their apprentices for years after their formal training ends. While neutral mages usu-ally place less onerous conditions on the teaching of their lore, most will at least ensure that their costs and time are adequately covered while the apprentice in question works hard to earn his keep. Only the most charitable of good mages considers mentoring an apprentice for free. Even after a relationship is established, the quality of instruction can vary widely from master to master, and, as many hopeful mages have learned, the most powerful wizards are not necessarily the best mentors. Often, a low- level spellcaster with patience and a willingness to give of his time and attention makes a better master than an imperious, inattentive archmage quicker to punish than instruct. THE ARCANE ORDER A well-established college of wizardry, the Arcane Order is based in the ancient stronghold of Math-ghamhna, a castlelike collection of towers and vaults carved from the ﬂ anks of a long-dead volcano. Students and masters alike engage in deep arcane studies, sharing with each other many of their own special insights into rare bits of arcana or spellcraft.",

In addition, many members pursue the path of the loremaster, re ﬂ ecting the scholarly inclination of the organization. Members who are powerful enough often aspire to become archmages. It ’s not unusual for a high-level member of the Arcane Order to have a couple of levels in two or three of these prestige classes, acquiring a smattering of abilities from each. SEEKERS OF THE SONG With music the world was made, and by using music the Seekers of the Song shape it further. While many members of this order of bards eventually take levels in the seeker of the song prestige class (see page 56), most seekers are simply like-minded bards and performers who gather regularly to exchange tales, frag- ments of lore, and new musical works. Beneath this surface camaraderie, though, all members of the order believe in the powerful magic of the primal music, and many make it their life’s work to explore this music and master its power. Although most people are familiar with the magic within a bard ’s song, the music of the seekers goes far beyond the regular power of bardic music, blending sound and power into one compelling truth. Though some individual seekers have gone to extreme lengths in pursuit of the music ’s power (ultimately turning it to evil ends), the order as a whole is more focused on trying to understand the source of this primal power, learning what it has to teach about the creation of the world and the nature of magic itself. Few in number compared to more mainstream guilds, the membership of the Seekers of the Song still tends to be powerful. Because their goals are generally seen as little threat to law and order, seekers are generally able to operate outside the social and cultural mainstream; only occasionally will a seeker use the power of her music t o  a s s um e  a  p o s i ti o n  o f  l e a d e r s h i p  wi t h in  a  c o m m un i ty ,  a d v e n turin g party , o r mili tary f o r ce. On su ch oc casi o ns, the order as a whole tends to hold itself at arm ’s length from the individual ’s goals and actions, quickly disavowing any connection to disreputable or suspect behavior (but just as quick to seek assistance and resources from an individual seeker who attains any measure of glory and fame). Joining the Seekers: The Seekers of the Song have few rules, few requirements for membership, and only the loosest of organizational structure. Joining the order is essentially a matter of a character ﬁ nding other seekers and making known his desire to explore and embrace the primal music. The seekers maintain large libraries of lore and bardic magic in major cities, and though admission requires membership, another seeker ’s willingness to vouch for a hopeful ’s interest in the primal music is generally enough to grant it. Player Bene ﬁ ts: Upon joining the seekers, a character ﬁ rst and foremost gains a forum in which to further explore the primal music and gain access to resources and training. The order ’s libraries are open to all seekers willing to observe its requirements for peaceful use, and characters gain a +4 bonus on all Knowledge and bardic knowledge checks for which they spend at least a day at the library in study and research. Characters in the order can hail from any number of backgrounds; their ranks include many high-level NPCs often will- ing to provide advice and knowledge to other seekers. Though con ﬂ icts within the membership aren ’t unheard of, NPC seekers tend to be friendly toward other members, and while not generally quick to provide one another with aid against physical threats, a member can usually ﬁ nd a seeker spellcaster willing to cast spells at a 2 –5% discount below standard prices (see page 107 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide ).",

        "description":  "A campaign that includes the primal music as a major theme or focus offers many possibilities. The primal music can be seen as an underlying power that all characters are exposed to and will seek more of as the cam-paign progresses, or it might be one of many paths to power, possibly aligning with or competing against existing arcane and divine orders. Variations on the idea of primal music as a source of magical power might include establishing that primal music is the machination of a powerful evil creature or deity (possibly tying into or expanding on the opposing views surrounding the Karoninwaithe legend). THE WAYFARERS UNION In lands where arcane spellcasters are common and magic is prevalent, people in a hurry can avail themselves of a par-ticularly useful trick: hiring a wizard to cast teleport to take them where they need to go. The Wayfarers Union grew out of an effort to standardize the rates and procedures for such travel, to provide a medium through which willing spellcast- ers could earn the high fees associated with such services, and to give paying clients a way to quickly ﬁ nd spellcasters capable of taking them where they want to go. Wayfarers Union of ﬁ ces exist in a number of cities. Most ofﬁ ces are small, each serving as a base for no more than two or three spellcasters —who are rarely to be found sit- ting around and waiting for potential clients. Instead, the wayfarers retain a small staff of nonspellcasting agents to “work the desk. ” When a client comes in seeking quick trans-portation, the agents contact whichever union spellcaster happens to be available. A wayfarer can usually be ready to travel within the hour, but it ’s not unusual for all the union spellcasters in an of ﬁ ce to be away at the same time or booked ahead by other clients, so that additional teleportation ser- vices might not be available for several days.

While spellcasters are preferred, some nonarcanists have joined the guild, relying on a helm of teleportation or similar device to provide travel services. The initiation fee is 200 gp, and each member pays the union dues equal to 20% of all income gained through employing travel magic for clients, usually remitted on a quarterly basis. More than a few members “forget ” to keep track of the exact amount of dues they owe, but only the most egregious offenders are censured for this behavior. Player Bene ﬁ ts: Members of the Wayfarers Union have access to the wayfarer guide prestige class, although taking this class is not mandatory. Wayfarers have numerous contracts to supply teleportational shipping, and they also undertake particularly dangerous assignments. The great bene ﬁ t of belonging to the union is the opportu- nity to make a lot of money by offering spellcasting services.

The frequency of opportunities to take on teleportation assignments is left to the DM ’s discretion. As a rough rule of thumb, about one person per month seeks teleportation services in a small city, one person per week in a large city, and two people per week in a metropolis. Cities that serve as centers of government for large realms often have much more traf ﬁ c in the form of royal agents and diplomats going from place to place, and cities that are especially prosperous or blessed with magical qualities tend to have more traf ﬁ c as well.",

You ’ve joined the union because you like making money, and you ’re not afraid to say so.

Any sorcerer or wizard who knows the teleport spell is perfectly capable of carrying out at least some of the assignments offered by the union.ARCANE LORE All arcanists dream of mastering magical secrets known to no other spellcasters, and almost without exception, taking up the practice of magic is the beginning of a lonely and dif ﬁ cult exploration of powerful mysteries and secrets forgotten to all but a few. The particular talents and inclinations of a student of the arcane quickly lead him into places few others go; although a group of warmages might share much knowledge and many of the same spells when they ﬁ nish their training, the moment they embark on their own personal travels and studies, their skills and lore become their own. One might hone an interest in the arts of item creation, with his feats, skills, and spell choices re ﬂ ecting his talent. Another might stumble across the forgotten secrets of an ancient sect and become Born of the Three Thunders, a master of lightning and sonic spells. No matter how common the origins of any group of arcane spellcasters, each arcanist ultimately follows his own path. MULTICLASS SPECIALISTS AND PROHIBITED SCHOOLS As discussed on page 57 of the Player ’s Handbook,  a specialist wizard pays for an increased af ﬁ nity for the spells of his chosen school by selecting two prohibited schools (or just one, in the case of the diviner) whose spells, as well as spell trigger and spell completion items using those spells, are forever denied to him. One way around at least part of this restriction is for a specialist wizard to take levels in sorcerer, using her sorcerer spellcasting ability to master the spells and magic items she cannot use as a wizard. S u c h  a n  a p p r o a c h  c a r r i e s  c o s t s ,  o f  c o u r s e —ﬁ rst and foremost, the fact that spellcasting ability in the two arcane classes doesn ’t stack. A 7th-level necromancer/5th-level sorcerer casts spells from each class at the appropriate level, while a single-classed necromancer of caster level 12th has access to higher-level spells, better spell penetration checks, and better level-based variables. In the same way that a single-classed sorcerer gains an advantage over a wizard in the number of spells he can cast per day at the expense of delaying increases in spell power until higher levels, a mul-ticlass sorcerer/wizard drastically increases her daily spell output, but at the cost of decreasing the maximum level and power of those spells. The most ef ﬁ cient way to create a multiclass sorcerer/ wizard is often to take relatively low levels in sorcerer ( no more than two or three) and the rest of the character ’s levels in the wizard specialist class. This approach gives the character access to any prohibited schools through the sorcerer class, and though she won ’t be able to know or cast higher-level spells of those schools, she can freely use any spell trigger items based on spells of the formerly prohibited school or schools. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   185 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   185 9/15/04   9:41:24 AM 9/15/04   9:41:24 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 186ALTERNATIVE SPELLBOOKS Chapter 5 describes several options for designing, protecting, and disguising a wizard ’s spellbook. While arcane script remains the default medium in which most wizards record the details of the spells they prepare, standard spellbooks aren ’t the only means available for storing the workings of magic. Arcane Geometry A small number of wizards study the magic inherent in precisely scribed designs and perfect angles, abandoning the standard arcane symbology of words and equations.  The spellbook of a geometer (see page 40), its pages ﬁ lled with painstakingly precise diagrams of circles, arcs and angles, looks nothing like the spellbook of another wizard. While a standard spellbook requires a number of pages scribed with phrases and formulae to record a single spell of 2nd level or higher, a geometer can record any spell of any level on only a single page of his book. Learning to record and prepare spells through arcane geometry is almost as dif ﬁ cult as learning to prepare wizard spells in the ﬁ rst place, so to use this new symbology for his spellbooks, a wizard must take levels in the geometer prestige class. Structures More impressive than even the most extravagant grimoire, permanent structures (circles of standing stones, pyramids, labyrinths, towers, and the like) can be used to record the workings of arcane spells. At the simplest level, walls can be graven or painted with spell scripts (essentially serving as an oversized spellbook of plaster and stone), while in other cases, a structure ’s very form and arrangement can serve to record arcane information. A ring of standing stones each carved with a single glyph, for instance, could provide an arcanist with the information necessary to determine how the spell is to be cast from their physical orientation. Aside from the advantage of its permanence and strength, a structure can record spells that can then be prepared or learned by any number of spellcasters for as long the structure stands. At the same time, that openness means that anyone who visits the site (friend or foe) might be able to comprehend and ultimately use the spell scribed there. Preparing a spell from a structure works like preparing a spell from a borrowed spellbook (see page 178 of the Player ’s Handbook ). A spellcaster must ﬁ rst decipher the arcane markings with a read magic  spell or a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level), then succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) to prepare the spell. An arcanist can also scribe a structure spell into her spellbook (as if transcribing from another caster ’s spellbook) if she so desires.",

You can also advance beyond 10th level in a prestige class that already offers ten levels, but only if your character level is already 20th or higher. You cannot advance in a prestige class with fewer than ten levels beyond the maximum level indicated for that class, regardless of your character level. When an epic-level character advances beyond 10th level in a prestige class, he follows all the rules presented in the Dungeon Master ’s Guide.  In addition, the DM must create an epic-level progression for the prestige class, just as the Dungeon Master ’s Guide  presents epic-level progressions for the classes from the Player ’s Handbook.  Many, but not all, class features continue to accumulate after 10th level. The follow- ing guidelines describe how to create an epic prestige class progression, and are followed by a sample epic progression for the mage of the Arcane Order class (presented on page 48).• Base save bonuses and base attack bonus don ’t increase after 20th character level, and since a character can ’t take an epic progression in a prestige class without being at least a 21st-level character already, there are no base save or base attack columns for prestige classes beyond 10th level. Instead, use Table 6 –18: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses, page 206 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide,  to determine the character ’s epic bonus on saving throws and attack rolls. • A character continues to gain Hit Dice and skill points as normal beyond 10th level. • Generally speaking, any class feature that uses class level as part of a mathematical formula (such as a loremaster ’s lore check) continues to increase as normal by class level. However, any prestige class feature that calculates a save DC using the class level (such as the assassin ’s death attack) should add only one-half the character ’s class levels above 10th. Thus, a 19th-level wizard/14th-level assassin ’s death attack would have a DC of 22 + Int modi ﬁ er (base 10 + 10 class levels + 1/2 class levels above 10th). Without this adjustment, the save DC for epic character prestige class abilities increases at a much higher rate than those of normal class abilities. • For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after 10th level at the same rate it did during the ten levels of the prestige class. Thus, a 13th-level loremaster adds thirteen to the caster level of her original class to determine total caster level. However, spells per day don ’t increase after 20th caster level. • The powers of familiars, special mounts, and ﬁ endish servants continue to increase as their masters gain levels if they ’re based on a formula that includes the character ’s level. • A n y  c l a s s  f e a t u r e s  t h a t  i n c r e a s e  o r  a c c u m u l a t e  a s  p a r t of a repeated pattern (such as an assassin ’s sneak attack damage) typically also continue to increase or accumulate after 10th level at the same rate. For instance, a 10th-level rogue/15th-level assassin would deal an extra 13d6 points of damage with a successful sneak attack (5d6 from rogue levels and 8d6 from assassin levels). An exception to this rule is any bonus feat progression granted as a class feature. Bonus feats gained by a prestige class don ’t increase with epic levels. The prestige class instead gains a new bonus feat progression that varies from class to class (see the next item). • I n  a d d i ti o n  t o  t h e  c l a s s  f e a tu r e s  r e t a in e d  fr o m  n o n e p i c levels, each prestige class gains bonus feats at a certain rate (usually every two, three, four, or ﬁ ve levels after 10th). These bonus feats augment each class ’s progression of class features, not all of which improve after 10th level, and are in addition to the feat that every character gains every three levels. • Epic prestige classes don ’t gain any new class features, and class features with a progression that slows or stops before 10th level or that have a limited list of options (such as the loremaster ’s list of secrets) typically don ’t improve as a character gains epic prestige class levels. Likewise, class features that are gained only once and do not improve as a character rises in level (such as a barbarian ’s fast movement) also do not improve at epic levels.",

A mage of the Arcane Order ’s number of spells per day does not increase after 10th level. If a mage of the Arcane Order memorizes his spells from a book (as a wizard does), then each time he achieves a new spell level he learns two new spells of any level that he can cast. Bonus Language:  For every four levels higher than 10th (14th, 18th, and so on), a mage of the Arcane Order gains another bonus language. Bonus Feats:  An epic mage of the Arcane Order gains a bonus feat every four levels after 10th. Spellpool:  If you have access to the Epic Level Handbook, an epic mage of the Arcane Order can also call epic spells from the Spellpool as long as he has the Epic Spellcasting feat. Treat epic spells as 10th-level spells for the purpose of accumulating Spellpool debt. A DM might wish to rule that certain epic spells are unavailable to an epic mage of the Ar-cane Order on a case-by-case basis.

This feat has no effect on spells that don ’t speci ﬁ cally deal a number of dice of damage equal to your level or half your level, even if the spell ’s effect is otherwise dictated by your level. Thus, it has no effect on magic missile  (though your level determines how many missiles you ﬁ re), Melf ’s acid arrow (though your level indicates how many rounds the acid deals damage), or produce ﬂ ame  (though you add your level to the base 1d4 points of damage dealt). Epic Spell Focus Choose a school of magic, such as illusion. Your spells of that school are far more potent than normal. Prerequisites: Greater Spell Focus in the selected school, ability to cast at least one 9th-level spell of the selected school. Bene ﬁ t: Add +1 to the DC of all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select. This bonus stacks with the bonuses from Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times but its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different school of magic. Epic Spell Penetration Your spells are tremendously potent, breaking through spell resistance with ease. Prerequisite: Greater Spell Penetration.

Improved Combat Casting You heighten your ability to cast spells while threatened without fear of being attacked. Prerequisites: Combat Casting, Concentration 25 ranks. Bene ﬁ t: You get a bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned. Master Staff You can activate a staff without using a charge. Prerequisites: Craft Staff, Spellcraft 30 ranks. Bene ﬁ t: When you activate a staff, you can expend a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one you have not used for the day, though you can lose a prepared spell to emulate a staff charge (but you cannot lose prepared spells from a specialty school). The spell slot expended must be equal to or higher in level than the speci ﬁ c spell stored in the staff (including any level-increasing metamagic enhancements). You cannot emulate a charge for a staff power or ability that does not match a speci ﬁ c spell. For example, you can use this feat to lose a prepared 3rd-level spell to activate lightning bolt from a staff of power , but you can ’t lose a spell to double the staff ’s melee damage because that power doesn ’t match a speci ﬁ c spell.Master Wand You can activate a wand without using a charge.",

However, bards cherish coming up with special training to alter a spell’s knowledge and many do learn Draconic as well, formulae to coax better results from its casting. adding an extra source of power to their spellcasting.

Most importantly, the study revealed the wrists, apparently not needing to move their whole secrets of dragon magic that the great wyrms have arms or perform any additional movements. kept hidden for millennia. Any spellcaster can learn to cast his spells without the need to move but they pay for this liberty with an increased difficulty in the casting process, which uses up their reserves for the casting of more powerful spells. Wizards are trying to emulate the subtle movements of draconic spellcasting and, while 44 5 DRAGON MAGIC – AN OVERVIEW successful, they still cannot duplicate this with ease. Mortals excel at this, surpassing dragons for they Even simplified spells still require an extra strain can achieve pinnacles of power in mere decades, from the caster’s will. while the great wyrms take centuries to reach them. That is, dragons are content with their innate talents The Magic of Resonance and rarely put effort towards their magical training, acquiring spells simply by being what they are.

Touching the mind of a dragon requires arcane energies called forth by the words and formidable strength of will, for their thoughts are channelled through the movements. convoluted and complex. Only those with enough self-control may try to touch a dragon’s mind, and It is still unknown how dragons use this pillar of only by a great presence of mind can magic. Some scholars believe dragons do not need the spellcaster even try to have material components but use the power inherent in some effect. their own blood to cast.

Any layman can learn to recite a known for the great creatures spell’s words, perform its movements to hum it constantly, especially and recognise its ingredients but if he when spellcasting or using their does not posses that inner spark of other innate magical abilities. will, all his efforts are for naught. The Draconic language plays an important role in this dragonsong, as its natural cadence and pronunciation are the foundation of its rhythm and melody. Of all the arcane spellcasters, bards have the most interest in dragonsong, given that they are already able to create magic out of their art, and dedicate a lot of time into learning to pronounce Draconic correctly. Bards and other dracomancers claim that the dragonsong is the song of creation, and that mastering it along with the draconic language is a key to plucking the strings of magic directly, instead of relying on arcane formulae. High Draconic The common Draconic language spoken by kobolds, lizardfolk and other reptilian races is a pidgin of 66 DRAGON MAGIC – AN OVERVIEW what dragons use everyday but even that is only a Dracomancers have also discovered that dragon scratch of High Draconic, the language dragons use blood is not exclusive to sorcerers.

However, they are also aware of the to misunderstand the term. A dragon master is a power coursing through their entire being, and dracomancer who has gained enough expertise in his may sometimes award a worthy ally a token of studies of dragons and power in channelling dragon their friendship.

This ultimate gift of dragonkind they live long enough, may even win an argument or is only known as a legend, for if anyone has ever two and escape with their lives. received it, they prefer to remain quiet about it. Spellcasters who follow the path of dragon mastery strive to use their knowledge to gain power over Secrets of Blood dragons but whether that goal is even attainable is Perhaps one of the most widely known expression something yet to be seen. of dragon magic is also the least understood, as it is based on rumour and hearsay but its effects are clearly visible. The magic of a dragon’s bloodline is expressed in the raw magical talent of sorcerers. Even if they all cast spells in a fundamentally similar way, not all sorcerers can count a dragon among their ancestors. Those who do and work towards tapping that potential to its fullest can fire up their blood, calling upon their heritage to enhance their magical capabilities. 66 7 DRACONIC – LANGUAGE OF MAGIC Draconic – way the Draconic language works, they discovered certain grammatical rules that apply to spellcasting. Thanks to the contributions of brave and foolhardy Language of researchers, dracomancers were also able to discover the existence of High Draconic, the language that is actually used by dragons for their spells. Magic With the combined lore of Draconic, High Draconic M agical incantations come in many ancient and the principles of spellcasting, dracomancers have languages but the most commonly used is slowly pieced together several magical techniques Draconic as dragons, being possibly the that come close to the dragon’s power.

Using High Draconic to boost metamagic casting has two main advantages: the first is that the spell does not take higher level slots to cast. The second is that, due to the improvisational method of using High Draconic, the caster does not need to possess the feat for the metamagic effect he wants to achieve. It is certainly a lot easier to improvise metamagic effects if the caster does know the feat but it is not mandatory. For this freedom, the caster pays in skill, devoted spell slots and, above all, the risk he takes when attempting this change. Changing the verbal component is a spontaneous effect. Even wizards need not prepare an altered spell beforehand but can add the alterations as they trigger the final words of the spell they did prepare.

The character can ascertain creatures by non- visual means (mostly hearing and scent but also by noticing vibrations and other environmental clues) with a range of 30 feet. This ability makes invisibility and darkness (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the character (though it still cannot see ethereal creatures). Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish colour or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight but it is not subject to gaze attacks nor is it penalised by blinding attacks. Deafening attacks partially thwart draconic blindsight, reducing it to a range of 15 feet. Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.

It is a green dragon… you will need some protection against acid if you want to face it.’ ‘Way ahead of you, dragon master Tiral.’ The party’s wizard patted his scroll case as he spoke to the scholar, who had come with them so far. He had refused to come at first but he buckled under the promise of a cask full of the dragon’s blood and his choice of bones. He had even brought his wife. ‘I would rather not have you call me that so close to a dragon’s lair.’ The scholar chuckled. ‘They do not take well to a human being called their master.’ ‘These are kobold lands’, the woman interrupted. ‘Three clans at least as close as a two-day walk.’ ‘So?’ Costicar tightened the straps of his armour. ‘We can deal with kobolds easy enough.’ ‘We would rather not’, Tiral’s wife continued. ‘An encounter would weaken you, and you need all your resources to fight the dragon.’ ‘You are not coming with us?’ One of the other fighters asked. ‘Hell, no’, Caros chuckled again. ‘I only promised to take you to the lair.

Armies assault or lay siege to these key objectives as a matter of course. Sometimes a great battle might be waged in a shallow valley between two hillocks, where the commanders can both look down upon the melee as it unfolds. Rugged hills offer plenty of hiding places, even for entire regiments, so skirmishes or small battles could result from ambushes. A battlefield in the hills could have any number of for- tifications, earthworks, or other terrain features, created by either the attackers or the defenders. Higher ground offers a significant advantage for an army, doubly so if it also occupies a stronghold atop a hill. Ruins of previous structures might provide low walls for cover. Natural features such as undergrowth, streams, and the occasional tree are also scattered about most hills terrain. Mountain Battlefields Massive conflicts in mountain terrain usually occur in alpine meadows. Only in such places is there enough open space for armies to gather into any sort of formation. Cliffs, chasms, and rubble make it difficult to muster a force of significant size in rugged mountains, and most great battles in (and over) forbidding mountains are usually of the aerial variety. Desert Battlefields The shifting dunes of a sandy desert quickly over- come any attempt at fortification. Trenches fill in with sand, walls become buried under sand dunes, and earthworks simply blow away. Rocky deserts and tundra both hamper the creation of structures due to a lack of avail- able material. Desert battlefields most often have just natural terrain features and few, if any, manufactured ones. Plains Battlefields Large meadows or tracts of farmland are perfect stages for clashes between massive armies, making plains ter- rain the most common site of battlefield Illus. by W.
