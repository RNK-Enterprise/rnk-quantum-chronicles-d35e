Lore of the Guild: Despite the care of individual members to keep their activities secret, a few rumors and tales of the Shadowmind Guild’s exploits have reached the general populace. The most common of these describes the fate of a small-minded lord who publicly denounced the guild and devoted much of his personal wealth to ﬁnding and destroying the group. The noble not only lost his fortune to a mysterious group of thieves, but he also forgot he ever had such wealth or power.

A Shadowmind Guild Campaign: Although the Shadowmind Guild is small and exclusive, its members have incredibly varied skill sets, making the guild an interesting choice as the focus of a psionics-oriented campaign.

TALESPINNERS LEAGUE Centuries ago, some members of the College of Con - crescent Lore objected on philosophical grounds to the organization’s secretive approach to information. Their desire to share information with outsiders literally tore the college in two. The disaffected members formed the Talespinners League, a college devoted to the free ﬂow of information. Since that time, league members have honed their performance skills and branched out beyond the history and arcana studies that Concrescent Lorists favor. Many Talespinners are bards, but occasional arcane spellcasters are also welcome, especially if they are members of the virtuoso prestige class. The Talespinners League collects every kind of lore imaginable. Not as academic as the College of Concrescent Lore, Talespinners study down-to-earth topics such as the everyday traditions of various cul - tures. Members spend their time gathering all kinds of information.  Rather than relying on academic reports to disperse it, the league embeds its lore within historical or fictitious tales. Any member is free to specialize if desired, but anyone can change specialties at a moment’s notice. The Talespinners League is based on the master-appren - tice relationship. New students learn lore from masters and eventually become masters themselves. The mas - ters in each region meet once or twice a year and make any necessary decisions by a simple majority vote. (Usu - ally, there aren’t many pressing issues, because league members tend not to involve themselves with politics.) Once that part of the meeting is over, other invited members arrive, and the gath - ering becomes a grand exercise in tale-swapping. Each member who attends is expected as a matter of courtesy to share (via a tale) any new lore un - covered since the last meeting. Keeping secrets is against the league’s code of conduct, but the only penalty for doing so is a lack of tales to tell at the regional meeting. Secretive or trouble - some Talespinners are rarely booted out of the league. They just don’t get invita - tions to future meetings, and the rest of the college learns to ignore them. The league’s motto is “The heart of the tale is in the telling.” Talespinners don’t wear robes, but many add blue and white tassels to their clothing.

EPIC-LEVEL PRESTIGE CLASS CHARACTERS The Dungeon Master’s Guide has information on advanc - ing the standard classes beyond 20th level. You can also advance the class level of a ten-level prestige class beyond 10th level, but only if your character level is already 20th or higher. You cannot advance the class level of a class with fewer than ten levels beyond the maximum described for that class, regardless of your character level. When your epic-level character advances a prestige class beyond 10th level, follow all the rules presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide . In addition, you must create an epic-level progression for your prestige class, just as the Dungeon Master’s Guide presents epic-level progressions for the classes from the Player’s Handbook . Many, but not all, class features continue to accumulate after 10th level. The following guidelines describe how to create an epic class progression, and are followed by a sample epic progression for the dungeon delver prestige class (see page 42 ). — Your base save bonuses and base attack bonus don’t increase after character level 20th. Since you can’t achieve 11th level or higher in a prestige class without being at least a 21st-level character, there are no columns for base saves or base attacks for these classes beyond 10th level. Instead, use Table 6–18: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses, page 206 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide , to determine a character’s epic bonus on saving throws and attacks. — You continue to gain Hit Dice and skill points as normal beyond 10th level. — Generally speaking, any class feature that uses class level as part of a mathematical formula, such as a shadowbane inquisitor’s smite damage, continues to increase as normal by class level. However, any prestige class feature that calculates a save DC using class level (such as the ghost-faced killer’s frightful attack) should add only half the character’s class levels above 10th. Thus, a 14th-level ghost-faced killer’s frightful attack would have a DC of 22 (10 + class level up to 10th + 1/2 class levels above 10th) + Charisma modiﬁer. Without this adjustment, the save DCs for epic-level character prestige class abilities increase at a much greater rate than those for normal class abilities. — For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after 10th level at the same rate it did during the ﬁrst ten levels of the prestige class. Thus, a 13th-level vigilante adds 13 to his caster level derived from another class to determine total caster level. However, spells per day don’t increase after character level 20th. — The powers of familiars, special mounts, and animal companions continue to increase as their masters gain levels, if they’re based on a formula that includes the character’s level. — Any class features that increase or accumulate as part of a repeated pattern (such as a dishonorable dread pirate’s sneak attack) also continue to increase or accumulate after 10th level at the same rate. An exception to this rule is any bonus feat progression granted as a class feature. If you get bonus feats as part of a class feature, these do not increase with epic levels. Instead, these classes get a new bonus feat progression (which varies from class to class; see below). — In addition to the class features retained from non - epic levels, each class gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or ﬁve levels after 10th. This bonus feat augments each class’s progression of class features, because not all classes otherwise improve class features after 10th level. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that every character gets every three levels (as per Table 6–19: Epic Experience and Level-Dependent Beneﬁts, page 206 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). — You don’t gain any new class features, because there aren’t any new class features described for these levels. Class features with a progression that slows or stops before 10th level and features that have a limited list of options do not improve as you gain epic levels. Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single level do not improve. SAMPLE PRESTIGE CLASS EPIC",

        "description":  "EPIC LEVELS AND PRESTIGE CLASSES The epic rules allow you to go beyond the normal level limit in a prestige class, but only if it is a ten-level class. Why can’t you add levels to a prestige class with fewer than ten levels? It’s Too Easy: Maxing out a ten-level prestige class takes a lot of time and effort, detracting significantly from your pursuit of the core classes. Even after maxing out a prestige class with only five levels, for instance, you haven’t taken more than a short detour from your main class or classes. It’s Not Significant Enough: Characters with ten levels in the assassin prestige class undoubtedly think of themselves as as - sassins, regardless of the fact that they also have ten levels in one or more other classes. If you’ve taken fewer than ten levels in a prestige class, those levels represent a smaller fraction of your character’s identity. It’s Hard to Build an Epic Progression: With only a few levels to guide you, it’s hard to determine what an appropriate progres - sion of class features would be for the class. The rate of improve - ment of a special ability might be too fast to extrapolate over an infinite number of levels, or there might simply be too few class features to build a unique epic progression. That said, if your DM wants to allow a character to gain epic levels in a prestige class with fewer than ten levels in its progression, that’s okay. Work together with your DM to create an epic progression for the class (see the Behind the Curtain: Building an Epic Progression sidebar, page 210 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs190 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 191CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS  of skill are classic achievements for adventurers of all levels.
