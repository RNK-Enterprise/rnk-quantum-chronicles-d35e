Some say rakshasas are the very embodiment of evil. Few beings are more malevolent. A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human. While this doesn’t detract from the creature’s manual dexterity, it makes a rakshasa look very disturbing to those unfamiliar with the creature. A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human. Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon. COMBAT In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary. Detect Thoughts (Su): A rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
