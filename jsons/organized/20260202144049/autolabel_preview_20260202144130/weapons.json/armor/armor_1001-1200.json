        "description":  "Magic Item Creation is the latest in Mongoose Publishing’s Encyclopaedia Arcane line, presenting a new look at one of the most critical components of any fantasy game, the magic item. Designed to be slotted seamlessly into any fantasy based d20 system, these sourcebooks enhance and expand every element of arcane magic, adding a whole new dimension to your campaigns. Each book of the Encyclopaedia Arcane line is not just intended for the Games Master to enhance his campaign, however. Players themselves will find full details on how to use the new magic systems with new or existing characters, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with in Core Rulebooks I and II. 22 INTRODUCTION The grand doors opened and the mousy acolyte stuck his head into the chamber. ‘It is nearly time, my lords. My master bids you attend him and plead thy case in hopes of earning his favour.’ Rogerio favoured the acolyte with his widest grin, his teeth, recently made perfect in the arcane salons of Tarak- Albay, glittered brightly in the candlelight. ‘We seek the favour of the one your master serves, unless you imply the archbishop has received some impressive promotion no one has seen fit to tell us about.’ The acolyte’s mouth dropped open and then snapped shut again. He fled away down the hall, stockinged feet whoosh, whoosh, whooshing like leaves flitting on cobblestones, hounded by Rogerio’s derisive laughter. Rogerio stood, brushed the dust from his silken finery and turned to Thorovald. ‘Ah, my friend. As always, your silence speaks less eloquently than you probably imagine.’ He laughed again, then sighed. ‘Come now, Thorvald, we do this for your benefit as much as mine. Say something. You speak so seldom that you had best practice when you are able. We do intend to seek the favour of a god, you will remember.’ Thorvald rose to his feet and stood, towering over the bard. ‘Fine. I will speak plainly with you, Rogerio, as banter is not in my nature. I like this not. I like this not at all. I have sacrificed too much in this quest already. The thought of pleading at the soft feet of toads does not sit easy with me. And make no mistake, the archbishop is a toad. I would do nearly anything to see this quest succeed but I do not think you should ask me to do this.’ Thorvald gripped Rogerio’s arm, his thick, gnarled fingers engulfing the smaller man’s upper arm entirely. ‘Do not ask me to do this. He has an ill-favoured look.’ Rogerio snorted. ‘If I mistrusted every man with an ill-favoured look, I’d naught be able to sleep in the same room with myself.’ He patted Thorvald’s hand reassuringly. ‘Our enemies already wish to send us to an early grave, no need to worry yourself into it for them. Come.’ ***** ‘Your words are as eloquent as the stories say,’ the acolyte said, as the archbishop nodded in the background, chins jiggling. ‘Truly, Rogerio, your reputation is well earned. Yet, it pains me to say my patron remains unmoved. The Father of All Winters will not help you in your fool’s quest. Of course, a substantial donation to the church’s coffers may serve to –’ ‘Enough!’ Thorvald’s shout echoed through the audience chamber. He strode forward, shoving aside the stunned acolyte and marching past the now pale archbishop. ‘I say, enough! Rogerio, do you not understand? When you seek the master’s favour, you do not whisper honeyed words into the ears of his dog.’ Leaping up onto the altar, Thorvald squelched a score of half-burned, tallow devotional candles beneath the heavy bulk of his boots. ‘Hear me, o’ Father of Winters! Here is the voice of one who seeks your favour, your patronage and your power! Here is the voice of Thorvald, son of Thorovask, son of Thorovalk, friend to Rogerio and his brother in all but blood. We are servants of snow, servants of winter! I come to you now hiding nothing, openly, without artifice and without feigned humbleness.’ Thorvald pulled his axe free of its bindings and waved it over his head, its blade slick and wet as ice. ‘We have slain in your name. We have torn down thrones in your name. We have built churches in your honour, we have built a nation and kept it free! I come to you here seeking only the means to serve you still more. You respect strength and we have it. You respect courage and we have shown it. Give us now your patron’s pledge and we will do more, we will make this world tremble! Give us the means to bring magic to our weapons and in exchange I offer this pledge. I offer...’ The archbishop began to laugh. ‘What, barbarian? What can one such as you hope to offer his magnificence?’ It was Rogerio who answered, whispering. ‘We can slay the Sun King.’ And thunder rocked the crystal columns as a voice like the arctic winds boomed in the audience hall… ‘LET IT BE DONE.’ 22 3 NEW ARMOUR, SHIELD AND WEAPON ABILITIES New Armour,",

N ot all magic items are created the same. Quirks, both positive and negative, are separated into The vagaries of magic and the unique ways two categories, major and minor. The difference in which each caster manipulates magical between them is one of scale. A minor quirk is one energies ensure that, even amongst items which which is nothing more than a limited special effect, or are otherwise identical in their powers, there will a physical property which has no mechanical effects. be easily identifiable quirks which will make each A major quirk, while still not as powerful as an actual one unmistakable. Sometimes, these quirks will be item ability, is one which can have actual mechanical beneficial, giving the wielder access to a minor power, effects on the wielder or those around him. or perhaps increasing the item’s effectiveness in some particular situation, but it is equally likely that these Any permanent item (meaning one which is not a quirks will be detrimental, perhaps inflicting the owner single-use item, like a scroll) can have one or more with warts, or perhaps simply failing to work at random quirks. The exact number of quirks which can be intervals. embedded in an item is left up to the Games Master’s discretion but it is recommended that an item, This chapter introduces a new concept for magic items regardless of its power, be allowed no more than one in the form of quirks, minor magical effects which major positive and one major negative quirk, and no allow both Games Masters and Players to personalise more than two minor quirks. While minor quirks can the items they create, giving them unique attributes be selected in any combination (subject to Games which serve to both further differentiate items from Master approval, of course), a positive major quirk one another and make them more noteworthy. The must be accompanied by a major negative quirk and use of these quirks is, of course, entirely optional but vice versa. Under no circumstances should two quirks they will do much to spice up the magic items in your which directly counter one another’s effects be applied game without actually increasing or decreasing their to a single magic item. power. Creating New Quirks Note that no table for rolling random quirks is included with these optional rules. This Though the number of suggested quirks listed is intentional. While rolling randomly in this chapter is extensive enough to provide can be entertaining, it can too easily lead a good basis for most campaigns, there will to strange combinations of results which undoubtedly come a time when either a destroy the believability of a magic item, Player will come up with an idea or at least stretch it to the point where it for a quirk which is not on this becomes the butt of Player’s jokes; after list.

The aura is barely visible and can take any form, usually related to the powers or history of the magic item. So, for example, a sword crafted by a wizard obsessed with insects might be surrounded by buzzing, spectral flies, or be covered by an army of phantasmal ants.

The amount of the penalty is directly proportional to the rarity of the group the penalty applies against, with the greater bonus applied to exceptionally rare groups (see the sidebar, above, for details).

So, for example, a sword might pound out a sound exactly like a war drum, while a hammer might ring with the sound of the forge. An item whose powers depend on sound cannot possess this quirk.

Cavellan’s Gem of Great Insight The arch-wizard Cavellan was, in his lifetime, perhaps the most learned of all mortal scholars, a genius unparalleled in the fields of magical research and medicinal studies. In addition to his sharp mind, Cavellan was also famed for both his incredible age and his fussy obsession with neatness. Upon his death, his vast collection of magical knick knacks and bric-a-brac quickly began to circulate throughout both the adventuring and the scholarly community. His most favoured magical item, Cavellan’s gem of great insight quickly gained a reputation for both its usefulness and for its singularly unpleasant side- effects. 1166 17 NEW INTELLIGENT ITEM OPTIONS New items.

Exotic components have a power all their of crafting magic items. The Mythic System is intended own, power enough to equal that of even the mightiest to supplement, rather than replace the existing rules for spells. This means that they are ideal candidates for use magic item creation provided in Core Rulebook I and in the creation of magical items. Exotic components are Core Rulebook II. This means that you will be able broken down into several broad groups, namely: to use both the Mythic System and the standard rules in your campaign, unless you choose otherwise.

Components in all cases, these rules are intended to supercede can take almost any form but are subject to the specific those found in Core Rulebook I and II but only for the requirements of the item they are intended to be used purposes of using the Mythic System. to create. In addition, creature components must be relatively intact, or their magic will not work; this means that while a gorgon hide with a few sword holes in it is still acceptable as a creature component, a half- 4422 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM disintegrated dragon skin which is mostly composed spiritual, or otherworldly locations, like grass from of cinders is not. Creature components can only come the rolling fields of fae, or lava from the boiling heart from creatures which have supernatural powers, or of the Ninth Plane of Hell, or a chunk of altar from a which are innately magical; creatures of the animal deity’s throne.

The true name of love, the last snowflake of from non-sentient objects. Chunks of tree bark, fist- winter, the deepest shadow in the under earth, the sized diamonds and pieces of marble taken from final memories of an ant crushed beneath a giant’s consecrated altars are all examples of non-animate heel and the first lie told by an honest man are all exotic materials. Non-animate components need not examples of esoteric components. In essence, if it be taken from innately magical objects (bark from cannot be held in the hand, if it cannot be carried in a dryad’s tree, dirt from a saint’s burial mound) but a box, or if it is only an idea, a thought, a memory often are. Typically, non-animate components are or a concept, then it is an esoteric component. One otherwise mundane materials which are harvested of the most important aspects of gathering esoteric from locations which are touched by supernatural, components is intent; no matter how skilled the adventurer, no matter how wise, no matter how fortunate, an esoteric component cannot be gained through happenstance, nor may it be gathered ahead of time, ‘just in case’. Instead, an esoteric component can only grant a magical spark if it is gathered expressly for the purposes of crafting a specific magic item (though the Games Master is of course free to disregard this rule in the interest of creating a good adventure). Uses for Exotic Materials Exotic materials can be used in several fashions, each with its own set of specific rules and requirements. These specific rules are outlined following the universal limitations which are described below. † An individual exotic material can only be applied to a single use outlined below. So, if a crafter wishes to use exotic materials to both replace needed spells and to defray experience point costs involved in creation, then he must use two different exotic materials. † Two identical exotic materials cannot be used to fulfil multiple purposes. That is to say that, for example, two phoenix pinions cannot be used to both replace a needed spell and to defray 4422 43 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM experience point costs. The same general type of † Exotic materials are always, without exception, exotic materials can be used, however, meaning two consumed or drained in the item creation process. different creature components could be used for two This does not, however, mean that a true name or different purposes. other, similar object or concept of similar cosmic import is destroyed.

Using Esoteric Components Esoteric components are perhaps the most mythic of all the mythic components, or at least the ones most likely to evoke memories of fairy and storybook tales from childhood. Unfortunately, they are also the most likely of the exotic materials to evoke painful memories of new age, feel-good, faux mythic hokum, the sort of stuff which is the bane of good fantasy literature. So how do you stay on the right track? By Games Mastering boldly. The worst way to introduce esoteric concepts into your campaign is timidly and apologetically. Remember that the thematic inspirations for esoteric concepts have existed for thousands of years. If esoteric concepts are good enough to form the basis of society building myths, they are certainly good enough for your campaigns. That said, there are few things worse than an esoteric concept which is overly twee, precious and pretentious. Esoteric concepts should be bold and should be based around strong, easily understood ideas. Look to real world mythology for inspiration, as well as to fairy tales and the fantasy stories of the golden age of 20th Century fantasy. A good esoteric concept is one which can be summed up in only a few words and which does not require you to embellish it with words best left to the pages of bodice-ripping romance novels. As a good rule of thumb, an esoteric concept should involve no more than 3-4 key descriptive words: the first snowflake of winter, the scream of a dying god, the shadow of a demon’s tear, that sort of thing. You want us to find a What? Esoteric concepts as exotic components can be a hard sell to roleplaying gamers for two reasons. First, much of the d20 fan base is drawn from those who are most familiar and comfortable with sword and sorcery tales, a genre which tends towards the down to earth and which concerns itself more with glittering jewels and notched iron than it does with eye of newt and seventh sons of seventh sons. Second, the historical culture of fantasy gaming is one which concerns itself primarily with the tangible, even where magic and spirituality is concerned; rewards of gold and titles, monsters which give physical embodiment to evil, avatars of gods which stride the earth, treasures and spell components which can be picked up and clenched in a heroic fist. Given the above, it is to be expected that Players may be taken aback when you first tell them that, to forge the mighty sword Nightbane, they must capture the true name of bats and trap the hangman’s shadow in an ivory box. To avoid this, it is best that you insure that the Player’s first exposure to esoteric concept components be a gradual one. Mention the use of esoteric concepts in the histories of famous magical items, or in the flavour text describing the exploits of the campaign world’s most famous and chronicled heroes. An effort can be made to use reasonably tangible elements in the first esoteric concepts introduced into the campaign. A quest to find the first blossom of spring on the mountain of Foozle is a good example of a esoteric concept with some very tangible elements; Mount Foozle is a definite place and a blossom is an object the Players can (metaphorically) grasp, so it fits into the scheme of tangible reward for achievement of a tangible goal which is at the heart of d20 fantasy gaming. You should also not be afraid to use real world mythological, fairy tale or fantasy literature examples to illustrate what you are trying to accomplish. Do not be afraid to directly tell Players that you are ‘wanting this adventure to be like the Earthsea books’, or that you want the campaign to evoke Norse mythology. If you give Players good, solid reasons for the use of esoteric concepts, then they will rise to the occasion and willingly suspend their disbelief. 4444 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM Using Exotic Materials to Replace Needed Spells component must come from a location or object which possesses ambient magic of some sort.

In addition, the hero must have character levels equal to the minimum required to select the feat, but need not meet any other requirements. If a divinely sponsored hero successfully completes his quest, he gains knowledge of the appropriate Item Creation feat but does not gain knowledge of the spells needed to craft the specific item. These he must gain in some other fashion (often by completing another quest). Once the item in question has been crafted, all knowledge of the Item Creation feat is lost. 5500 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS Help for are rendered impotent in the face of magical arsenals of staggering power.

The best way to that you should use the reduced price when calculating combat this is to provide them with opponents who just how much magic is appropriate for a character at can plausibly challenge them without need of magic each level. Instead, you should allow the Players to buy weapons and tools.

Standard This is the default level of magic item ability, at least according to the guidelines presented in Core Rulebook II. Since so much has already been said about gaming at this level of power, we will not spend too much time here. It would behoove you, however, to keep the issues raised by lowering or raising the availability of magic items in mind, since the issues raised there may bring to light concerns in your own game. Rare In a campaign in which magic items are rare, several adventures, or even levels, might pass between the acquisition of each magical item, making each such item, no matter how humble or mighty, precious to both characters and Players. There are, of course, varying levels of rarity, from campaigns in which adventurers, kings, powerful monsters and mighty Non-Player Character spellcasters have standard levels of magic items while others are lucky to buy the occasional potion, to worlds in which the concept of even a high level adventurer carrying around more than two items each will be completely alien. Regardless of the degree of rarity, you should keep these issues in mind. Rarity breeds greed. If the Players know there are only a handful of gauntlets of ogre power in the world, be prepared to watch them fall all over themselves to take them, by any means necessary, should they meet any Non-Player Character who owns a pair. On the good side, this allows you to use magical items as adventure 5544 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS carrots, leading the Players and their characters eagerly fore; since their damage resistance can be more easily from plot to plot.

This may be fine for you and may well characters with gold pieces instead of magic swords, fit your Games Mastering style, but do not forget that you should either simply reduce the expected reward Players hunger for the opportunity to play with the or replace it with other, less tangible prizes. The toys they work so hard to earn. One way to encourage chief reason for doing so is this; in a campaign where your Players to spend precious charges is to offer them characters do not earn magic items instead of gold, assurances that they will be able to replace them in or cannot simply spend their jewels on magic items, some fashion, perhaps by ‘coincidentally’ placing a enormous stacks of gold and jewels are meaningless, similar item in a treasure hoard just as the character’s since nothing short of buying a small country will is down to its last charges. ever deplete their purses.

Beyond that, if they must face death and worse each time they want to brew a healing draught, they will, probably both loudly and vehemently, wonder why it is that anyone would ever bother to do it. Beware of every adventure becoming, by default, a component harvest. Should you find that the Players are chopping up every monster they fight into its component bits and then scooping them into jars, or if they begin to break off chunks of every strange looking piece of tree, rock and lichen they find, or if you notice a marked increase in their fervent prayers to their deity of choice (or of the moment), then it is a safe bet that your Players are component harvesting. While you may not have a problem with it, it can slow the game down, since your Players will spend so much of their time bookkeeping and asking you ‘does this look useful?’ to which the usual answer is ‘could be’. In addition, rampant component harvesting can also spoil the flavour of the Mythic System, reducing it to a game of ‘raid the wizard’s pantry’, or a dangerous quest into the castle basement. It is relatively easy to discourage component harvest, fortunately. The easiest way to do it is to remind the Players that the components they harvest can, and will, rot long before they will see use. In addition, you are well within your rights to rule that, without taking special precautions, the majority of the usable parts of the creatures they slay will be rendered unusable by the ruthless application of sword and spell. 5588 59 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS ‘We have seen it through to the end, my brother.’ Rogerio hefted his mug in his right hand and, wincing, flexed the shattered remnants of his left.

Of course,’ he said, draining the remnants of his cup ‘they’re right in that.’ ‘You’ve told the toad of our deed?’ Thorvald belched again. ‘No need. Word preceded us. We, my friend, are infamous.’ Rogerio leapt onto the table, staggered over the remnants of the venison and fell heavily, scattering bits of potato and bread everywhere. ‘Or, at any rate,’ he said, poking his finger at Thorvald, ‘more infamous than we already were.’ Thorvald nodded and pounded the table with a fist. ‘Good. Then he will help us?’ ‘No need for that either.’ Rogerio said. ‘Don’t you hear it, my friend? The Father of Winters is creeping around in my head and whispering secrets.’ ‘I hear nothing. ‘ Rogerio grinned, the broken ruins of his teeth still glittering, white as snow. ‘Not even an echo? On a still day, you can hear the sound of a rabbit’s fart across a flat plain! I’d think even the deaf could hear a god stomping around in your head.’ ‘I say again that I cannot.’ Thorvald was suddenly serious. ‘Do you think something is wrong with me?’ ‘Undoubtedly. Would you like a list?’ Rogerio sat up and swung his legs down over the side of the table, scattering tawdry trinkets – gifts from doxies, mostly – and discarded food around himself. ‘Seriously though, my brother,’ he said, rummaging through his pockets for his pipe, ‘I know you have the spark inside you now, just as I do. I sense it, if you do not. On the morrow, we will fire those sparks and our weapons will sing with the power of endless winter.’ ‘Aye, they will.’ The big, rough-bearded man cracked his knuckles and leant back, nearly toppling the rude bench he was perched on. Frowning his beetled brow, he shoved a comatose partygoer onto the stone floor. The girl landed in a heap, hiccuping lightly in her sleep. ‘Now,’ Rogerio said, throwing himself down onto the bench next to Thorvald, ‘we’d best see what we can do to scare up some more beer. Tomorrow we will participate in the making of a miracle. And I make it a policy to never participate in such events sober.’ 6600 DESIGNER\u0027S NOTES Designer\u0027s to really build on the idea of magic items as an integral part of an adventurer’s capabilities, an idea which the core rules are already built around. The magic item Notes quirks should work to make each item you create more unique and to bring d20 magic items more in line with their legendary and fictional inspirations. W henever you start a new book, you have, or Thanks at least should have, some idea of what you want to accomplish in your writing. The I will start this off the same way I always do, by problem with this book was not coming up with the thanking my wife and children, who keep me sane idea of what I wanted to accomplish but narrowing and humble, at least when they are not driving me down the number of ideas. ‘Write a book about magic crazy and telling me how wonderful my writing is items for us’ – may as well ask me to ‘write a book (every writer needs at least one groupie). about stuff’. A book about magic items can take just about any form and in the years since the release of I also want to thank the guys at Mongoose for giving d20 fantasy gaming, a book in just about every one of me a chance to write this book and for giving me those forms has been released. There are books which money for doing it. Hooray! are simply lists of new magical gear, there are books which provide detailed histories for artefacts, there I would like to sing the praises of the fine folk who are books of magical tomes and books of new magical wrote the core rules for creating magic items. It is properties and everything else under the stars. Is there nice to finally have an actual set of rules, so that my room for anything new? Is it even possible to really wizards can make neat stuff, instead of always having present something new about magic items? to search around for the neat stuff created who-knows- how by ancient spellcasters. Well, I certainly hope so. Finally, I would like to thank all the writers, I guess if I can find any fault with the current rules for mythmakers and dreamers whose inspiration and magic items, it is that there is still a little too much imagination provided the framework upon which this dependence on specific combinations of feats and work and every other book ever written about fantasy spells, taking some of the wonder out of magic item gaming is built. Thank you all. creation. On the face of it, this is not really a fault, since mechanics work best when they are presented in Patrick Younts a fairly straightforward manner. The problem comes when those mechanics render the eventual flavour of the campaign mechanical as well. That is the problem I see with Core Rulebook II’s rules for magic; the need for specific combinations of spells eliminates some of the mythic element to crafting magical objects. That is why I created the Mythic System for this book. It is not a comprehensive rewrite of the existing magic system - it does not have to be, since the default rules are both useful and effective. Instead, it is a spice, a new layer of paint, a curtain if you will, which both works to make the system prettier and make the raw mechanics of creating magic items less obvious. I think the system works well and I hope you will agree. The rest of the book was written with the same goals in mind. The new options for intelligent magic items expand your creative horizons when making such items, so that you can make an intelligent item of almost any sort. The new prestige classes are intended 6600 61 RULES SUMMARY Rules Summary List of Quirks Minor Quirks Major Negative Quirks Animal Call Aged Buttons Loosen Blunted Everclean Clumsy Extremities Swell Dangerous Font of Youth Disfiguring Frost/Flame Draining Hair Growth Faceless Light Fickle Phantom Smell Hair Loss Phantom Sound Hatred Rainbow Aura Loud Sands of Time Reluctant Shadow Vagabond Siren Shivers Unlucky Skin Tint Unreliable Sneeze/Cough Spectral Aura Static Electricity Voice Alters Void Eyes New Weapon Abilities Warm/Cool Base Price Warts/Scales/Etc Special Ability Modifier Acidic +1 bonus Major Positive Quirks Acid Flare +2 bonus Cunning +1 bonus Eager Destructive +1 bonus Environment Bonus Explosive +2 bonus Eternal Hammering +1 bonus Faceless Heaven’s Wrath +2 bonus Fury Hell’s Fury +2 bonus Hardy Honourable +1 bonus Impressive Inconspicuous Howling Fury +2 bonus Light Idiocy +2 bonus Loyal Overpowering +2 bonus Lucky Resonating +1 bonus Nightsinger/Daysinger Ruinous +2 bonus Pristine Shredding +1 bonus Resistant True Death +3 bonus Savage Virulent +2 bonus Warmth/Chill Wise 6622 RULES SUMMARY New Armour and Shield Abilities Special Ability Base Price Modifier Boosting +2 bonus Frightening +3,700 gp Frightening, Improved +15,000 gp Frightening, Greater +33,750 gp Kinetic +2 bonus Nimble +3,700 gp Nimble, Improved +15,000 gp Nimble, Greater +33,750 gp Refracting +3 bonus Spring Heel +3,700 gp Spring Heel, Improved +15,000 gp Spring Heel, Greater +33,750 gp New Feats General Feats Prerequisites Benefit Awaken Magical Cha 13+ Automatically detect magical items Properties Bonded Armour, Iron Will Bonded magical armament gains further Shield or Weapon enhancements Bonded Ring, Rod, Iron Will Bonded magical item gains further Staff or Wand enhancements Great Resistance Iron Will, Wis 15+ +2 bonus to resist magic item effects and DR 2/nonmagical Increased Spellcraft 8 ranks, any Item Use your caster level rather than an item\u0027s to Effectiveness Creation feat, ability to cast arcane determine save DCs and beating SR or divine spells Item Aptitude Cha 15+ Use Magic Device becomes a class skill and gains a +2 bonus Soul Armour, Shield Bonded Armour, Shield or Weapon Bonded magical armament becomes further or Weapon enhanced by your dedicated link Item Creation Feats Prerequisites Benefit Borrow Strength Any Item Creation feat, Int or Wis Use another\u0027s energy to fuel item creation 17+ Greater Capacity Craft Rod, Craft Staff or Craft Created magical items contain 75 rather than Wand 50 charges Improved Item Any two Item Creation feats Created magical items cost 1/50th XP to Creation make, rather than 1/25th XP Reforge Item Int 15+, at least one of Craft Magic Restore even badly damaged or drained Arms and Armour, Craft Rod, Craft magical items or even artefacts Staff, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item or Forge Ring Speedy Crafting Dex 13+, at least one of Craft Only spend 1 day crafting a magic item per Magic Arms and Armour, Craft 2,000 gp of the base price Rod, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item or Forge Ring Strange Affinity Craft Wondrous Item Create magic items oddly aligned with their body placement 6622 63 LICENCE Open Game License creation and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

HAVOC MAGE Combat magic is usually reserved for spellcasters in the second rank who are content to lob spells as if artillery from behind the cover of front-rank combatants. Not so the havoc mage, who shares as much in common with a fighter as with a wizard. The havoc mage has learned to toss off spells with such reckless abandon that he can fight head-to-head with both sword and spell without incurring the bitter consequences other spellcasters must con- tend with. A havoc mage is interested in maximum carnage in the shortest amount of time, by dint of a quick spell cast where an enemy least expects it. A havoc mage must first learn the ways of arcane magic, so those most likely to take up the sword (to complement the wand) are sorcerers and wizards. These normally sedate characters are drawn to the frenzy of battle, during which a flashing sword can be just as effective in their own hands as a well-timed spell. NPC havoc mages are more likely than other spellcasters to be lone adventurers, since they are adept both at arms and magic. However, the most successful havoc mages are those who join their talents with those of a balanced group of com- batants and spellcasters.",
