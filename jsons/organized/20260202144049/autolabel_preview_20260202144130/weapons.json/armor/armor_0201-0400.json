The rogue next to the bulette in position Rl on the map labeled Flanking Big Creatures is fl anking if she has an ally in position Al, Bl, Cl, or Dl. Better still, allies in all those spots get fl anking bonuses from the rogue; thus, one “backstop” character can give fl anking bonuses to multiple allies. If you or your ally take up more than one square, the same principle applies—simply draw your line from the centerpoint of the whole character, not the center of an individual square. The centaur rogue in position R2 does not fl ank the bulette with the cen- taur in position A2, but he does with the centaurs in positions B2, C2, and D2.

Most fire spells don’t set anything on fire, and even you’re doing for the rest of the round. fewer set creatures on fire.

While a sustaining song is in effect, a dying character does not check to become stable each round and does not automatically lose any hit points for not becoming stable. A sustaining song lasts for a maximum of 5 minutes or until the virtuoso stops the sustaining song effect, whichever comes first. The virtuoso prestige class also has an ability called calumny, which is a supernatural, mind-affecting, language-dependent ability. What is a language- dependent ability? A language-dependent effect uses intelligible language as a medium. If the subject cannot understand what the ability user says, the effect fails. “Language dependent” is a standard descriptor for spells and other magical effects. It is described under Descriptors in Chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook. When a virtuoso at 1st level gets the bardic music ability, does she also get one additional use of this ability per level like the bard? If the virtuoso also has bard levels, can the character use her daily virtuoso allotment of bardic music for bard music abilities? Can she use her daily bard allotment of bardic music for bard levels, and can she use her daily virtuoso allotment of bardic music for virtuoso music abilities? Yes to all. Uses of bardic music from the virtuoso and bard classes are completely interchangeable. Add up the daily uses of bardic music for each class. The character can expend these on any bardic music ability her bard or virtuoso classes make available to her. The short description of the harmonize spell on page 88 of Song and Silence says the spell pools the talents of multiple bards to grant one of them extra temporary ranks of Perform. When you read the full description of the spell on page 92, however, it says the spell grants the lead performer a circumstance bonus on Perform checks equal to +1 per three bard levels of the backup performers. Which is correct? The spell description is correct. The healthful slumber spell from Song and Silence doubles the subject’s natural healing rate. The Heal skill allows for long-term care that also doubles the recipient’s natural healing rate. Does a character who receives both long-term care and a healthful slumber spell heal at four times the normal rate? You don’t multiply multipliers—you combine them into a single multiplier instead. Each extra multiple adds +1 to the original multiplier, so two doublings triple the original (see page 275 in the Player’s Handbook). In the case of healthful slumber plus successful long-term care, a subject regains 3 hit points per level per day of light activity, or 4.5 hit points per level per day of complete bed rest.

In some cultures he is part of the warrior aristocracy. The details of the master samurai code are quite specific. Master samurai are required and expected to demonstrate absolute obedience to their feudal overlord, even if his lord’s commands might result in the master samurai’s certain death. He remains ready to die for his lord or his honor at a moment’s notice, and to avenge to the death any slight to either. His personal honor demands that he repay all debts fairly. Perhaps the most important tenet of this code is the expectation that the master samurai never commit a dishonorable act or demonstrate the slightest fear of personal injury or death. Master samurai who fail to live up to these strictures face personal shame so overwhelming that they prefer to destroy themselves rather than live under its shadow. Fighters, rangers, and paladins make excellent master samurai, and they find that its class abilities enhance their own combat potential. Monks also make good master samurai: The discipline of bushido is a natural reflection of the monk’s desire to study a philosophy or belief with single-minded determination. Wizards and sorcerers may find it difficult to qual- ify for master samurai, but those who do enjoy the martial enhancements available to them.",

Peasants, fishermen, and even nobles do not seek out the varied and dangerous situations into which PCs constantly find them- selves. Whether the adventurer finds herself in town or dungeon, forest or desert, the world and its various elements—people, monsters, buildings, geogra- phy, climate, religion, and customs—informs her choices and options, and affects her adventuring career, and those of her companions. The Fighter and the World Whether you play a fighter who plays the role of honorable knight-errant or callous mercenary, gallant cavalier or king of the highwaymen, the world in which you adventure and live has an impact on your choices and alternatives. A common stereotype dogs many fighter characters: The ordinary person whose only contri- bution to the party involves the abil- ity to swing a sword. While a sword 40 (or an axe, mace, or halberd) is unar- guably a fighter’s most obvious role during a game session, consider how W11829_620_00_Sword\u0026Fist 9/18/00 2:42 PM Page 41 CHAPTER 3:WORLDLY MATTERS Knights of the Watch (see page 47), or purchases entry into a large mercenary company. He might even demonstrate his worth to an individual of high station, such as a noble or a high priestess, and so be invited to join a retinue as a privileged bodyguard or special agent. Such circumstances often alter the fighter’s role within the adventuring party, because the fighter no longer exists solely for kicking in doors and bashing monsters. He now possesses responsibilities and commitments beyond those to his adventuring comrades, and this leads both to new adventuring opportunities and internal disputes for the party at large. Adventuring Roles Nearly every fighter who elects to pursue adventuring as a regular enterprise has the same role to play in their respective parties: They are the first to fight, whether eliminating opposing creatures or defending their comrades from attack. This should come as any surprise, for no other character class has better general fighting capabilities than the fighter. Below are a few brief ideas for fighters’ roles beyond just door-smasher and orc-basher. (For even more on PC backgrounds, see the Hero Builder’s Guidebook.)",
