(Colossal) Among the most dangerous terrors of the Underdark, maulgoths are solitary masters of stone. They move quickly over or through any stone substance. This great mobility enables a maulgoth to flee through solid stone in the rare instances when it finds itself overmatched. Maulgoths look like horrid amalgamations of flesh and stone. The central body of a maulgoth is shaped like a large, malformed rhinoceros, with four powerful legs and four tentacles. Its greenish-gray body is covered with rocklike spikes and protrusions, and its hide feels like stone to all but the most experienced hand. Although maulgoths exhibit a power over the natural world akin to that of a druid, they have none of the love for the environment that most druids share. They cal- lously use the natural world as their first line of defense, controlling animals and plants to serve their needs. Maulgoths speak Undercommon and Terran. COMBAT Fierce, inventive combatants, maulgoths hunt large stretches of caverns, answering to nothing but their own whims. Maulgoths love fighting from ambush, and their ability to move in and out of solid stone at will allows them to fight successful hit-and-run battles even against groups of powerful foes. 123 MAULGOTH Maulgoth MM A maulgoth often begins battle against a dangerous move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing group by using its Spring Attack feat and its ethereal jolt maulgoth pushes the maulgoth back 30 feet but has no ability to force some of its foes onto the Ethereal Plane. other effect.
