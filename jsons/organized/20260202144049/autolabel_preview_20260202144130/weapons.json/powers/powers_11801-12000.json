Mark (Ex): At 1st level, the character can target, or mark, an individual humanoid foe. To do so, the blood- hound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to start the process again. Once this study is complete, that target is called a mark, and the bloodhound receives a variety of advantages against him or her (see below). A bloodhound may have up to one mark per two bloodhound levels (rounded up) at once, but only if all of them are within 30 feet of one another for the duration of the marking process. For example, a 6th-level bloodhound could mark three bugbears in such a group, but not a bugbear on one side of the kingdom and a troll on the other. If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending an existing one, the latter is unmarked, and the bloodhound loses XP equal to the amount he would have gotten for defeating that creature.

Expecting only a flesh wound, the paladin is stunned to watch his companion of many adventures crumple to the earth. This unfor- tunate knight has trespassed into the domain of the deepwood sniper, and he may not make it out alive. A deepwood sniper is patient, careful, quiet, and deadly accurate. She is a stealthy, long-range terminator whose arrows sail accurately from much longer ranges than those of other archers. In addition, she has magical abilities to help her shafts fly true. Because of their alertness, dexterity, patience, and affinity for the bow, elves of almost any character class make excellent deepwood snipers. For a long time, elves would train only those of their own race in these tech- niques, but more recently some half-elves, halflings, and humans have joined the ranks of the deepwood sniper.",

Greater wild shape works like wild shape, with the following excep- tions. As she rises in level, the shifter gains the ability to assume the forms of creatures with types other than animal (see Table 5–15 for details), though she cannot choose a form that normally has more Hit Dice than she herself does. She can designate at the time of the change which pieces of her equipment meld into her new form and which do not. Nonmelded equipment alters its size to match that of her new form, but retains its functional- ity. The shifter cannot, however, use any equipment unless she has either an appropriate appendage or a mag- ical means of compensating for the lack of one. Any piece of equipment that is separated from her reverts to its original form. At 1st level, the shifter is limited to humanoid forms of Small and Medium-size. Thereafter, she can use greater wild shape two more times per day for every two shifter levels she gains, and her range of available creature sizes and types increases as shown on Table 5–15. When she gains the ability to adopt an undead shape at 5th level, she may become incorporeal if she chooses the form of a creature with that subtype. If the shifter already has the wild shape ability from another class, she may convert her uses per day of wild shape to uses per day of greater wild shape on a one-for-one basis. She may also mix and match the benefits of the two abilities as desired to gain the maximum advantage for any daily use. Thus, a Drd8/ 69 shifter1 has up to four uses per day of greater wild shape, and she could use the ability to become a Large hu- manoid (because an 8th-level druid can become a Large CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES creature and a 1st-level shifter can adopt the form of a hu- manoid).

Poets use colorful terms such as dancer to describe the movement of a tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this fighting style is not about dancing. Nor is it about impressing anyone—least of all poets. The tempest focuses on learning the ultimate se- crets of two-weapon fighting for a single purpose—the destruction of her enemies. Typically hardy individualists, tempests rarely learn their skills through any sort of formal training. Instead, they master their an though constant application of its disciplines and experimentation on their foes. Similarly, no matter how famous tempests become, it’s rare for them to take on students. Their art, they say, is one that can be learned but never taught. This prestige class is open to all classes and races. Though tempests are rare, every humanoid race has boasted at least a few. Elves make for nimble, clever tem- pests whose dexterity works to their advantage. Dwarves, perhaps because they favor heavy armor and heavy weap- ons, are the least likely characters to become tempests. Even members of the smaller races can find the tempest’s path appealing.",

He has left behind the druid’s search for global understanding of nature’s secrets to focus all his energies on the world’s plant life. Elven and half-elven druids are the most likely charac- ters to embrace the role of the verdant lord. Druids of other races, rangers, and the occasional priest of Obad- Hai or Ehlonna have also been known to adopt this prestige class.

How does the cumulative penalty to Strength from the languor spell work? I’m having a hard time understanding the wording in the spell description.
