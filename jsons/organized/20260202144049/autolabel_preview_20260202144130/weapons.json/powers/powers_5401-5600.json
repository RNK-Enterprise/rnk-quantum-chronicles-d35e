Although some tribes are ferocious and can’t be reasoned with, many adopt a pragmatic attitude toward seafaring peoples and operate guide services. Through malenti go-betweens, these sahua- gin negotiate trade deals with other races—even aquatic elves. In such a setting, Coral’s Bite is not necessarily an object of fear to sahuagin. In fact, nothing prevents a sahuagin from wielding the trident in any setting, although its monstrous humanoid bane ability is dangerous to the fi sh-people. It might even be the signature weapon of a great sahuagin hero instead of an aquatic elf. To customize Coral’s Bite, its bane ability might instead target animals (such as horrid orca) or magical beasts (such as fi endish squid). On the other hand, many sahuagin revere the dark god known as the Devourer, lord of the violent forces of nature. They take their worship to literal extremes, believing that greater power comes from killing and consuming intelligent enemies. The Devourer’s favored weapon is the trident, and his sahuagin worshipers are intolerant of a nonsahuagin unlocking the power of such a mighty weapon. A character who wields Coral’s Bite might fi nd herself under repeated attack by reli- gious zealots who want not only to take the trident but also to devour her in punishment for her audacity. Coral’s Bite in Faerûn A signature item of the aquatic elves who inhabit Faerûnian seas is the trident of serenity (this item is detailed in Races of Faerûn, page 172). This +1 trident also has the ability to suppress rage- and fear-based effects within 15 feet, including sahuagin blood frenzy. To customize Coral’s Bite for an aquatic FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, you can replace its water breathing legacy ability with a new ability called “serenity” that reproduces the effect of the trident of serenity. Alter- natively, slow the coral armor progression or give it no special abilities relating to underwater breathing. This version of the weapon is obviously best suited to aquatic elves rather than air breathers. Coral’s Bite could also be a weapon of the tritons who inhabit the hidden city at the bottom of the Bay of Dancing Dolphins off the coast of Dambrath (see the Shining South supplement, page 96). They protect their city with illusion magic to keep it from being found by surface dwellers, and their allies the dolphins keep it safe from underwater attack. Should the sahuagin of the bay mount a more organized assault, a champion of the tritons might take up the legacy weapon. 61 LEGACY ITEMS OF CHAPTER 3 CRIMSON RUINATION announced his intentions to slay Tarkalkatos.

The ancient lich Vol and her followers see undeath as a path to divinity, and through necromancy and even bloodline manipulation, they pursue this twisted end. Those who serve deities of light and life despise the dark ambitions of the Blood of Vol, but the most fanatical champions against undeath are the follow- ers of the Silver Flame. This lawful good deity is a disembodied force of purity associated with a once- mortal paladin, dedicated to protecting humanity from supernatural evil. Many paladins follow the Silver Flame, and in the hands of such a champion, Divine Spark becomes a resplendent tool against the taint of Vol. Since Divine Spark is not tied to a specifi c god’s worship, a cleric or paladin of any deity could just as easily use it. It might even be found in the hands of a goblinoid cleric of Darguun’s Kech Volaar tribe.

If the PCs decide to alert the town guard rather than enter the house themselves, the cat burglar can hear the approaching soldiers in plenty of time to exit through an upper-fl oor window and dash across the rooftops. Catching her at that point is diffi cult unless one or more PCs have already climbed to the roofs of adjacent buildings in hopes of trapping her. Even in that situation, Urdine’s superior ability to feint in combat gives her an excellent chance of deny- ing an opponent a Dexterity bonus to AC. This allows her to make a sneak attack with a poisoned dagger, potentially paralyzing that opponent. If the paralysis succeeds, Urdine can make a break for it, tumbling past other pursuers as necessary. Should the party attempt to enter the house clandes- tinely to trap the burglar within, they can get through the front door without making additional noise. How- ever, Urdine is alert for the possibility of the family returning and makes frequent Listen checks in addition to potentially hearing the characters. If she hears them, she attempts a rooftop escape as described above. If she is cornered while rifl ing through the top-fl oor closet, Urdine can put up a good fi ght. She has the advantage of being in a narrow space, which prevents her from being engaged by more than two opponents (although they can fl ank her). In this situation, she uses the following tactics. Round 1: If Urdine wins initiative against one or both opponents, she uses Quick Draw to pull out a poisoned dagger. She then throws it at a fl at-footed character. If both are fl at-footed, she attacks the more lightly armored foe. (She hopes both to score a hit more easily and to use poison against a character who is less able to resist it.) She then feints against the other opponent (a move action) if fl at-footed, opening up that character to a sneak attack on the next round. If Urdine loses initiative and survives the initial attacks, she wastes no time in self-defense but instead hurls herself out the window, using Tumble to move safely past opponents and Jump to make a soft landing. She quickly disappears into the alleyways, making pursuit diffi cult unless other party members have been posted to watch for such an escape. Round 2: If one or both opponents are hindered or helpless because of her actions on round 1, Urdine follows through by making a sneak attack against a character paralyzed by poison or off balance due to a successful feint. She then tumbles out the window as above. 103 LEGACY ITEMS OF CHAPTER 3 GUURGAL the Hooded One woke, his left eye was a blind, A wickedly barbed spear, Guurgal has a long, sharp dead-white orb, but the spear lay across his chest, head of cold iron and a rough haft of darkwood. the tip still bloody.

Within this setting, Mindsplinter can be the focus of a struggle to prevent the troglodytes from becoming a more organized and powerful force.

Having excavated Melaki’s resting place and acquiring Mindsplinter, Xurg believes himself able to work toward that goal. The runescribes of the city are aware of the renegade and wish to put an end to his plans, but their weak standing army and reclusive ways make military action infeasible.

The following simple rules can add verisimilitude to the contest. A joust is run in a series of contact passes (usually three or four), and a contestant scores points according to the quality of the strike. After the prescribed number of passes, the high scorer is the winner; one or more additional passes might be run to break ties. The full rules for jousting can be quite detailed, involving exact locations of strikes, but these are not necessary to simulate the contest. See the Complete Warrior supplement, page 130, for more details on jousting. Points Awarded 1 Point: A hit that merely glances off the opponent’s shield. In game terms, this would be an attack that misses only because of the shield’s armor bonus (including enhancements, if any). 2 Points: A hit that lands solidly but is not followed by a successful trip or sunder attempt. 3 Points: A hit that lands solidly and results in a Spectator Stands dismount or a broken weapon or shield.

Hapnug on Worg Hapnug, mounted on his worg, leads the assault against an ambushed character. Tactical Notes Hapnug didn’t get to be the gang’s leader by being stupid. He is far cleverer than the average goblin, and a master of devious tactics. The bandits were able to come up with the idea for an ambush, but it was Hapnug who thought of dismounting a rider to increase their advantage (and of camoufl aging the rope). Assuming the rider is knocked from the saddle, the ambush proceeds as follows. If the rider notices the trap or manages to stay mounted, the goblins fade back into the woods and decline to start a confrontation. Round 1: Hapnug throws a javelin at the downed rider, then urges his mount forward while he draws Steadfast. The other goblins throw their javelins at the rider, unless the only clear shot is at the mount. The worg can’t charge through the undergrowth, but its fast land speed easily allows it to move into melee and Goblin Ambush attack.

(DC 15) At the twilight of his life, Anda was a great hero, revered and respected for many leagues beyond the forest where he dwelt with his friends, the treant Tarnla and the dryad Nidria. Younger druids from across the world traveled to his forest to learn from him, and kings and empresses alike consulted him for his wisdom of the natural world. Despite his fame, Anda had enemies among many peoples, savage and civilized. A combination of raw hatred, terrible greed, and petty jealousy brought down the great druid and destroyed much of his forest home. The orc chieftain Bruug, who had clashed with Anda in his youth, learned his old enemy still lived and sought to avenge himself upon the druid. Marshaling his forces, Bruug struck suddenly and fiercely into the northern marches of Anda’s forest, burning and destroying. Anda, along with Tarnla and Nidria, raced to contain the orcs, but even their combined might couldn’t hold the wicked host at bay. Animal messengers were sent out to the sovereigns whose lands abutted the forest, but jealous and hateful advisors, who saw the woods as a great resource to be exploited if the meddlesome druid were eliminated, convinced many monarchs to withhold their troops.

The Gatekeepers, on the other hand, are concerned entirely with defending the land against incursions by the dark forces of Khyber, and they specialize in fi ght- ing aberrations, fi ends, and the like. Most Gatekeepers are orcs, although some half-orcs and humans number among them, and their tradition goes back to ancient times. If Treebrother is in that sect’s possession, you must revise the weapon’s history somewhat—Gatekeeper orcs are not ravening brutes, and an orc attack against the weapon’s bearer doesn’t make much sense in that context. Instead, Anda, Tarnla, and Nidria fought to halt a fi endish invasion and reseal the portal that had held the horrors back. The Gatekeepers are likely to be guarding Treebrother’s grove closely, and they will have many pointed questions for those who wish to enter.
