During this entropic state, the victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (–4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). Each round spent in this entropic state, the victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim’s Wisdom score falls to 0, it discorporates into nothingness. A victim can gain control over itself by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 21 Charisma check. Success renders the victim immune from the entropic state for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. The entropic state is not a disease or a curse, so it is hard to remove.

Intercession (Su): A quell can cut divine spellcasters Raiment off from their source of power. To do so, the quell makes a turning check as if it were a cleric of a level equal to the quell’s Hit Dice (5th level). The result indicates the highest-level divine spellcasters the quell can cut off from their deity. The turning damage result indicates the maximum total Hit Dice of divine spellcasters within 60 feet the ability can affect. The quell’s intercession affects the closest divine spellcasters it can affect fi rst. Normally, affected divine spellcasters cannot turn undead or cast divine spells for 1 minute; however, if the quell has twice as many HD as the spellcaster has divine levels, the divine spellcaster loses the ability to cast divine spells for 24 hours. If the quell attacks an affected divine spellcaster in any way, or the affected spellcaster receives an atonement spell, the intercession ends.

However, wiser otherwise. 177 CAMPAIGNS CHAPTER 7 In Your Campaign Of the cults presented here, the Ruby Order is the best suited as an ally to a typical group of PCs. As a lawful neutral organi- zation, the Ruby Order can be counted on to hold up its end of any bargain, making it a reliable source of information and other resources to a like-minded party. Monks, lawful wizards and sorcerers, and other characters who share a devotion to discipline can fi nd acceptance or even training among the order’s ranks. Conversely, the Ruby Order can be a steadfast opponent to the PCs of your campaign, particularly if those characters tend more toward chaos than law (or even if they simply have a distaste for necromancy). If the Ruby Order perceives the characters as enemies, they have the will and patience to make the PCs’ lives a living hell. Sample Member Marys is a new member of the Ruby Order, and seeks to prove her worth to the cult by forbidding herself all earthly plea- sures. Unfortunately, her discipline is not yet strong enough to achieve this goal. After her periodic “binges,” she absolves her guilt by smiting those who tempted her. For best effect, characters should encounter her fi rst while in her ascetic mode, to set her up as a disciplined individual, only to meet her later in the midst of debauchery or while striking down her tempters.",

This organ 17 2 RETPAHC PEED EHT SRETSAM Central Nervous System The most highly developed of an aboleth’s organs is its cen- tral nervous system—in particular, its brain. An aboleth’s brain is a massive structure that accounts for nearly one-fi fth of the creature’s body mass. The brain is various shades of purple and looks somewhat similar in shape to an aboleth without its long tail. The brain consists of fi ve major sections, each of which is discussed below. Frontal Lobe (1): Located at the front of the brain, this cone-shaped lobe is pale purple and covered with thousands of tiny, hornlike protrusions. This lobe has two primary functions. First, it generates an aboleth’s powerful enslaving mental attack. Second, it functions as a telepathic core that enables the creature to converse with (cid:4) (cid:5) its enslaved minions, while preventing the minions from (cid:2) sensing anything in the aboleth’s mind but its unyielding domination and control. (cid:1) (cid:3) Primary Lobe (2): The primary lobe is located directly behind the frontal lobe and above the ventral lobe. It is here that an aboleth’s primary brain functions occur: thought, logic, intelligence, reason, and everything else that brains make possible in other creatures. The creature’s three optic nerves attach to this portion of the brain. Ventral Lobe (3): Although the ventral lobe looks like four separate tentacle-shaped lobes radiating out from below the primary lobe, it is in fact a single lobe, connected on the underside of the brain. The four arms of the lobe are A typical aboleth brain (numbers keyed to text references) striped with alternating bands of dark and light purple, and pumps blood throughout the body and maintains blood pres- they store the memories an aboleth has created for itself and sure, just as a normal heart does.

Sages have EYES managed to pin down the purpose for some of these organs Its multiple eyes are a beholder’s most notable (and feared) anatomical feature. In addition to providing the creature with all-around vision, the eyes can be used to aim, direct, and emit powerful supernatural effects. These effects aside, the eye of a beholder is a wondrous and complex organ that has long been the obsession of countless sages and wizards. (cid:4) A beholder’s eyeball is remarkably hard and solid, about as strong as a similarly sized ball of stone. While at rest, the eyes have a round, brilliantly colored iris (1). The iris seems to be some sort of translucent crystal (cid:3) consisting of hundreds of interlocking sheaves, each (cid:5) of which is capable of independent movement. This allows a beholder amazing control over the shape of its iris and the amount of light that is allowed to enter the (cid:1) (cid:2) eye. A beholder can adjust its iris to almost any shape imaginable, and can even expand it to the rim of its eye (cid:5) socket to give the appearance of having no iris at all. Curiously, a beholder’s eye doesn’t have a single lens. (cid:3) Rather, an eye can have as many as a dozen differently sized and shaped lenses (2), all capable of independent (cid:5) rotation and movement and linked to the movement of (cid:4) the iris. By adjusting these lenses and the iris, a beholder can aim with its eye ray. The numerous lenses have the added benefi t of granting the creature exceptional vision. All beholders possess darkvision out to 60 feet, and in brightly lit conditions can count the legs on a mosquito at over twice this distance.

The “guards” are actually human cultists, members of the Cult of the Nine-Tongued Worm named Tilkos, Werra, and Zard. Yikk Tasst summoned them to the house when it replaced Deros Frist, and they now serve the tsochar as guards and attendants. The worm cultists are aware that Deros Frist has somehow been transformed into a being that stands high in their cult, and they suspect a tsochar replacement. They play along with the masquerade, pretending that everything in the house is as it should be and passing themselves off as simple swords-for-hire. Players asking after Deros Frist are told that the master of the house is busy with his research, but if they press, one cultist consents to go speak to Deros Frist to see if he wishes to receive visitors.
