Conjuration Magic Last entry in a journal found on a slain mage, name unknown In the spells below, please note the use of two new descriptors - Prime and Hanging. The Prime descriptor indicates a spell that uses the field of power between the caster and the prime material plane to generate its effects. As such, the spell does not work if cast in a dimension other than the prime or if the caster is in a physical state other than corporeal. Outsiders can use Prime spells without difficulty, provided they are on the prime material plane when they do so and are corporeal at the time. Creatures who lack corporeality cannot use Prime spells at all, even if they can and do use Manifestation at the time of casting. Hanging spells are cast when an arcane spellcaster first prepares or regains his spell slots. These spells then remain ‘active’ throughout the rest of the day, awaiting only a single word to perform their full effect. While hanging, they count as current spell effects and maybe dispelled normally. Speaking the activation word is a free action that can be taken even if it is not the caster’s turn as long as he is not flatfooted at the time. Hanging spells count as spent spell slots and are instantly negated without effect if the spellcaster refills that spell slot for any reason, even through the use of an item like a ring of wizardry.

Thus, it is often more efficient to target nowhere for the monster to appear. Thus, rushing a summoned creature with dispel magic instead of a spell it has cast. Also, a dispel magic that successfully affects a summoned creature ends the spell that summoned it. This is an effective way to deal with a summon monster spell that summoned multiple monsters; dispel one creature, and every creature that came with it disappears as well. One last suggestion for dealing with conjurers is to make certain that occasionally environmental conditions exist to negate their abilities. Keep in mind the various external factors that can force a Concentration check during spellcasting. A pitched battle in a rainstorm on a violently listing ship offers no joy for a mage of any type, and distractions cannot be dealt with by casting on the defensive. There are also ways to make an area completely disruptive to summoning. A hallow or unhallow combined with dimensional anchor makes its protected area impervious to dimensional travel.

In other words, one of the players has just spent an afternoon making four flawless, fist-sized emeralds and now he wants to buy a town with them. What can you do? What should you do? That all depends on the tone and flavour of the campaign. If the world is one where magic is fairly common and powerful, it is not at all out of the question for any city to retain the services of a mage for such item transactions. One detect magic and the deceitful conjurer is going to have some explaining to do, probably from the back wall of a cell. After all, if the players can create emeralds, so can others. It has likely happened to the city in question long before the conjurer thought to try it. Once bitten, as they say, is a good rule to follow. This is not to say that the wily conjurer cannot accomplish anything with his false jewels, but he is going to have to be a lot more creative than, ‘So I go back, flirt with the elven teller, and unload these little beauties for some major coin.\u0027 In a lower magic setting, things become more difficult.

The easiest thing to enforce is alignment. A good-aligned conjurer would probably have a hard time with calling spells, as they are essentially enslavement and if used with creatures from the lower planes, evil. Consorting with demons and devils is not the kind of behaviour that affirms a person’s dedication to truth and justice. Enforce the strictures of the character’s alignment and the problem of calling spells might just solve itself without revenge becoming an issue. If that does not work or is not applicable, things have to get personal. A called entity, once released, will remember a number of things about the caster. It will recall the caster’s appearance, voice and mannerisms. It may, depending on what occurred around it, know the layout of the caster’s home or even have caught his name. It may have seen the conjurer’s friends and associates, apprentices, or pets. While a wise conjurer might try to limit the information a called entity can learn, wisdom has never been a prerequisite for the arcane arts. 5588 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS A Multiverse of Armed with this knowledge of the conjurer that enslaved it, the entity can instigate a campaign of Possibilities revenge that spans at least two dimensions and could take years to unfold.

The village was grateful for the rescue and though he had tried to include the deva in the story of how he had saved them, the townsfolk did not want to hear about her. They were a simple people and magic was both terrifying and unknown to them. In their eyes, he had somehow defeated the entire orcish horde by himself. It was flattering to be sure. The village had insisted he stay as their guest for as long as he wished. The guardsman who had given him this task in the first place, it turned out, had been the leader of the town militia and a landowner. With no family to inherit, the village had decided unanimously to give him the man’s house and farm. They just naturally seemed to assume the dead man’s former status went with the gift. Jestin found himself a homeowner, militia leader and hero, all in the same day. Of course, he did not have the first clue about how to run a militia. He was a wizard and a conjurer, a worker of spells in a village that feared magic. He was not half as strong or tough as the smallest man in the village and if he had to harvest a crop, he would probably rupture something. None of that seemed to matter in the slightest to these people. Days passed into weeks until a year had rolled by. His role in town became a comfortable one, if a little odd. The men of the village treated him like a younger brother, one that could not quite keep up with them but was no less wanted around anyway. The women had a harder time of things, as many were of his age or older, and unmarried. While he was welcome here and appreciated, he was still an outsider. The townsfolk never said as much, but he knew that he was not considered a suitable prospect for matchmaking. They did not act like he was a wizard around them, but they remembered it. Truly, that was just as well. He was too tired from the fieldwork and weapons practice every day to do much courting. Besides, no matter how lovely the girl, he could really only see one face when he closed his eyes. The deva had left her mark on him with that kiss. Sometimes, as night, he could still feel it burning his lips. He often fell asleep, body aching, with her voice in his mind. The season’s harvest had been pulled in and new seeds planted before it occurred to him to call on her again. The spell was obviously not one that offered any binding or control, but he found himself glad of that. Not that he could have done so in any event. He had long since traded most of his expensive components to travelling merchants for a replacement plough and new armour for the militia. He had even purchased a fine steel sword for himself and could claim to swing it passably. His life as a wizard had all but slipped away. Only one thing magical remained to be done. It was a quiet winter evening when he spoke the words of calling once more. At first, he was afraid he would falter from lack of practice, but when the light began to form in the centre of his study, he breathed a sigh of relief. From the glowing column stepped forth a vision in silver. The deva from so many autumn dreams took a look around the room, her glowing eyes finally coming to rest on him. To his amazement and delight, she smiled and laughed her melodious laugh. \u0027Jestinian of the Far Vale, Conjurer Supreme!\u0027 He looked up at her from his chair and rose to bow. \u0027It is Jestinian of Brookwarden, Farmer Substandard now, my lady,\u0027 his unexpected modesty surprising her. She looked him over with a critical eye and nodded. It might have been his wishful imagination, but she seemed to approve of what she saw. \u0027You seem different, Jestin.

Clerics and paladins are vital to that battle. Others may fight hard, but clerics and paladins charge their allies’ hearts with the fiercest resolve. Let glory and honor fall upon the shoulders of those divine few: the clerics and the paladins! Among the eleven character classes available in the Player’s Handbook, the cleric and the paladin both begin their adventuring careers with an array of divine abilities to protect them against the dangers common to their chosen way of life. They survive by combining martial talent with divine granted abilities and spells, and this combination makes them the undisputed masters of life and death. Deities and demons are their stock in trade, and reli- gious dedication, willpower, and leadership are their primary tools. Clerics and paladins cannot rely solely on martial prowess to achieve their goals: They must make their way in the world with care, fore- thought, and courage. With this in mind, this work examines these two character classes in depth. The information here should let you maximize their potential and your enjoyment when playing a cleric or a paladin.

Sometimes the daily of fuel for heating might eat a substantial portion of duties and events of a temple need the assistance of the temple’s treasury. passing adventurers.

Some evil churches may simply ignore the poor, choosing to flaunt their wealth and power rather than to share it. Adventure Support Adventuring is another expenditure faced by some churches. If a church supports adventurers, it may feed, clothe, and house them. It may pay for some or all of their training while they undertake quests for the church. It may provide free, or discounted, healing services. The church may provide some or all of the money for equipment, mounts, rations, weapons, armor, or even magic items. Churches may provide information adventurers need. Some churches may support a team of adventurers, some might support multiple teams, and still others might only provide these services to the clerics of the party. Advertising Advertising is always an expense. Bards and heralds may reach out to new arrivals in the area served by the church, and they may also attract backsliders 48 from the congregation. Banners become worn and weather-beaten and need repair or replacement.

Some temples also labor over magic Temples are a vital part of daily life. Clerics provide items, crafting weapons and tools for the defense and services and support to their flock, and to adventurers. advancement of the church (see Item Creation Feats, Experienced Dungeon Masters may use clerics’ duties page 77 of the Player’s Handbook, and Creating Magic as starting points for adventurers. Items, page 241 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide, for costs to create magic items). Other duties only occur occasionally. Miracle spells are rarely required, but sometimes a divination reveals an impending disaster before it occurs. Open battle, mundane or magical, with other temples does happen. Clerics may accompany military expeditions, depend- ing on the individual faith’s dogma. A new holy site may need the hallow spell cast over it. It’s up to the head of the local temple, if there is one, to decide which pleas for aid require a cleric from her temple, and which cleric to send. Some hierarchical temples hold gatherings periodi- cally. If they do, the meetings happen at least annually, but no more often than quarterly. A party of clerics from each local temple must travel to the superior temple for several days of prayer and discussion. Topics range from current events affecting the temple to obscure points of dogma. Adventuring Clerics Adventuring clerics usually don’t need to worry about how temple funds are spent, or which cleric will perform the noon service. The exception occurs 50 when they’re responsible for founding a new temple, when they may briefly be the only clerics present. They may need to worry about where the money T11840_620_00 Defenders2.qxd 2/5/01 3:54 PM Page 51 CHAPTER 3:PRESTIGE CLASSES C hapter 3: it difficult to meet the requirements of the prestige Prestige class, and rarely have the incentive to do so.

Since both versions of the character in your the added spellcasting level.

Does this exclude devils or does demons in The level 0 and level 5 lists are errors. this sense mean all lower planar creatures (demons, devils, and so on)? The description for the hospitaler prestige class in It means demons (denizens of the Abyss). If the power Defenders of the Faith first says a hospitaler gains levels worked against all so-called lower planar creatures, the text as a cleric for purposes of spellcasting as well as full would say so, or it would use the term “fiends.” access to all cleric spells, and then later it says the hospitaler levels are simply added to pre-existing caster The Divine Might feat from Defenders of the Faith lets levels (under Spells per Day).

However, the class announce that you’re using it and mark off a turn/rebuke use description has no mention of this ability. Does it stack for the day. with pre-existing turning ability, or is it a misprint and an ability not available to the class? Hospitalers gain the ability to turn undead at 3rd level, not 1st level. The character turns undead at her hospitaler level, – 2. This stacks with undead turning from other classes; add the character’s hospitaler level –2 to the class level for any other class that has turning ability. For example a 6th-level cleric/4th-level hospitaler turns undead as an 8th-level character. Note that paladins also use their class level –2 to determine their undead turning level, so a 6th-level paladin/4th-level hospitaler turns undead as a 6th-level character. There is a sidebar titled Ghosts and Vampires on page 67 of Defenders of the Faith. The sidebar says a master of shrouds can choose to summon these creatures in place of those master of shrouds could normally summon. However, the number summoned is not shown, and this ability is not referred to in the main text for the prestige class. How many vampires or ghosts are summoned? The sidebar in question shouldn’t be there at all; it was supposed to be cut from the book. You can ignore the sidebar, or you can assume that the character can summon ghosts or vampires of the same CR as the other undead the character can summon and in the same numbers. Each use counts against the character’s total summoning limit for the day. Because both ghosts and vampires are template creatures with variable abilities, you’ll need to create statistics for the creatures ahead of time. Note that a master of shrouds summons undead three times a day plus Charisma modifier (minimum once), and that the character’s level determines how powerful the undead creatures summoned can be. That is, a 10th-level master of shrouds with an 18 Charisma summons undead 6 times a day, not 24 times a day as some people seem to think the text implies.
