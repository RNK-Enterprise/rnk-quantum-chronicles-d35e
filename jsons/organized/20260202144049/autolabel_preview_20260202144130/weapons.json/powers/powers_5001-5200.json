        "description":  "Daggerspell shapers gain no proﬁciency with any weapon or armor. Daggercast (Ex): Daggerspell shapers seamlessly blend the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting abilities. A daggerspell shaper can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell shaper holds anything other than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell shaper can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger). Wild Shape (Su):  A daggerspell shaper can change into a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so more often than most other characters with the wild shape ability. See the druid class feature, page 37 of the Player’s Handbook. This ability lasts for 1 hour per class level or until she changes back. Levels of the daggerspell shaper prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of determining the maximum duration of the wild shape ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as the size and type of creature that a shaper can become). A daggerspell shaper gains one additional daily use of her wild shape ability at 1st level, 5th level, and 10th level. At 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper becomes able to use her wild shape ability to take the form of a Tiny animal. At 4th level, she can use wild shape to take the form of a Large animal. Dagger Claws (Su): When a daggerspell shaper of 2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with the corresponding limb in the shaper’s animal form, not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell shaper holding a +1 ﬂaming dagger in one hand and a +2 keen dagger in the other hand transforms into a leopard. The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the ﬂaming special ability, and the other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that cor - responds to the druid’s natural limbs, this ability has no effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability, her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper would be able to overcome a foe’s damage reduction as if both of her natural weapons were magic. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other beneﬁt a character of that class would have gained. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell shaper, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a dagger - spell shaper deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook. If a daggerspell shaper gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Fast Wild Shape (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a dag - gerspell shaper can use her wild shape ability as a move action rather than as a standard action. Enhanced Wild Shape (Su):  Starting at 8th level, a daggerspell shaper can preserve the physical enhance - ments granted by her equipment even when in wild shape. Whenever the shaper uses wild shape, she retains any enhancement bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or Consti - tution granted by any equipment she wears, even if the equipment can’t be worn normally by her new form. Daggerspell Flurry (Ex): A 10th-level daggerspell shaper can blend spellcasting with a ﬂurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, the shaper can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with her daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell’s effective level. A dagger - spell shaper must make at least one melee attack in any round in which she uses this ability, and she cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, she can still make the spell’s attack).Table 2–6: The Daggerspell Shaper Base Attack Fort Ref Will Level Bonus Save Save Save Special Spells per Day/Spells Known 1st +0 +0 +2 +2  Daggercast, wild shape (+1/day) — 2nd +1 +0 +3 +3  Dagger claws, wild shape (Tiny) +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 3rd +2 +1 +3 +3  Sneak attack +1d6 +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 4th +3 +1 +4 +4  Wild shape (Large) +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 5th +3 +1 +4 +4  Wild shape (+2/day) +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 6th +4 +2 +5 +5  Sneak attack +2d6 +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 7th +5 +2 +5 +5  Fast wild shape +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 8th +6 +2 +6 +6  Enhanced wild shape +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 9th +6 +3 +6 +6  Sneak attack +3d6 +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class 10th +7 +3 +7 +7  Daggerspell flurry, wild shape  +1 level of existing divine spellcasting class (+3/day)CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 36CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 37 Improved Evasion (Ex):  If Berkich is exposed to any effect that normally allows it to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Animal Companion Beneﬁts:  Zaadi and Rula enjoy the link and share spells special qualities. Link (Ex): Zaadi can handle Rula as a free action. She also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding her cheetah. Share Spells (Ex): Zaadi can have any spell she casts on herself also affect her animal companion if Rula is within 5 feet at the time. She can also cast a spell with a target of “You” on Rula. Daggercast (Ex): Zaadi can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If she holds anything other than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components as normal. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, Zaadi can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger). Daggerclaws (Su): If Zaadi uses her wild shape ability to assume animal form while holding her magic daggers, she incorporates the daggers’ enhancement bonuses and special qualities into the natural attacks of her wild-shaped form. One of her claw attacks gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the keen special ability (from her +1 keen dagger ), and the other claw gains a +1 enhancement bonus (from her +1 dagger ). The beneﬁts last for the duration of the wild shape effect. Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex):  Zaadi gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey. Sneak Attack (Ex): Zaadi deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern - ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Zaadi can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Trackless Step (Ex): Zaadi leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. Trapﬁnding (Ex): Zaadi can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Wild Shape (Su): Twice per day, Zaadi can change into a Tiny to Large animal and back again, as per the polymorph spell. Her preferred forms are that of a lion and a cheetah. This ability lasts for 9 hours or until she changes back. Woodland Stride (Ex): Zaadi can move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar ter - rain at her normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her. Druid Spells Prepared (caster level 8th): 0— cure minor wounds, detect magic, detect poison, guidance, light, read magic; 1st— charm animal (DC 14) , entangle (DC 14) , faerie ﬁre, longstrider, obscuring mist; 2nd— bull’s strength, ﬂame blade (+9 melee touch) , resist energy, summon swarm; 3rd— cure moderate wounds, dominate animal (DC 16) , greater magic fang, poison (+9 melee touch, DC 16) ; 4th— ﬂame strike (DC 17) , freedom of movement .",

A dread pirate, however, has mastered every aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network of contacts tells him when a particularly valuable cargo is shipping out. After a ﬂawless ambush at sea, he swings aboard the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand. Once he and his shipmates have overpowered the prize vessel’s crew, they liberate the cargo and make their escape. Later, the dread pirate meets representatives from the black market in an isolated cove and sells his newly acquired cargo for a handsome proﬁt. Some dread pirates accomplish their goals through fear, killing indiscriminately and ruling their ships at rapier- point. Others minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious sort of chivalry, perhaps realizing that the captain and crew of a prize ship are more likely to surrender if they believe they will live to see port again. Now and then a dread pirate takes his chivalric streak a step farther and preys only on the ships of enemy nations—or even solely on other pirates. A dread pirate’s lifestyle is ideal for most rogues, because the job requires a number of skills that other classes don’t have the time or inclination to learn. How - ever, the class also attracts some spellcasters, who can use magic to conceal their ships or incapacitate a prize vessel’s crew.",

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Dread pirates are proﬁcient with all simple weapons, with light martial weapons, and with the rapier. Dread pirates are proﬁcient with light armor but not with shields. Seamanship (Ex):  A dread pirate adds his class level as an insight bonus on all Profession (sailor) checks. Allies within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight bonus equal to half this number on their Profession (sailor) checks. Two-Weapon Fighting: A dread pirate wearing light or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the feat. Fearsome Reputation (Ex): By the time he attains 2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding undue bloodshed, honoring ﬂags of truce, and the like) or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire treatment of prisoners). An honorable dread pirate gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks, while a dishonorable one gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at 10th level. In addition, a dread pirate gains other abilities at higher levels based on his chosen reputation. A dread pirate’s actual activities or alignment need not match his reputation. However, a radical shift away from his reputation might negate or even reverse that reputation at the DM’s option. Also, a dread pirate in disguise does not gain any effect granted by his reputa - tion (including the special abilities described below that depend on the dread pirate’s reputation). Rally the Crew (Ex):  Starting at 3rd level, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 38CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 39 A daggerspell shaper can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Dexterity bonus (minimum 1).

Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, Zaadi can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger). Daggerclaws (Su): If Zaadi uses her wild shape ability to assume animal form while holding her magic daggers, she incorporates the daggers’ enhancement bonuses and special qualities into the natural attacks of her wild-shaped form. One of her claw attacks gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the keen special ability (from her +1 keen dagger ), and the other claw gains a +1 enhancement bonus (from her +1 dagger ). The beneﬁts last for the duration of the wild shape effect. Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex):  Zaadi gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey. Sneak Attack (Ex): Zaadi deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern - ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Zaadi can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Trackless Step (Ex): Zaadi leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. Trapﬁnding (Ex): Zaadi can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Wild Shape (Su): Twice per day, Zaadi can change into a Tiny to Large animal and back again, as per the polymorph spell. Her preferred forms are that of a lion and a cheetah. This ability lasts for 9 hours or until she changes back. Woodland Stride (Ex): Zaadi can move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar ter - rain at her normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her. Druid Spells Prepared (caster level 8th): 0— cure minor wounds, detect magic, detect poison, guidance, light, read magic; 1st— charm animal (DC 14) , entangle (DC 14) , faerie ﬁre, longstrider, obscuring mist; 2nd— bull’s strength, ﬂame blade (+9 melee touch) , resist energy, summon swarm; 3rd— cure moderate wounds, dominate animal (DC 16) , greater magic fang, poison (+9 melee touch, DC 16) ; 4th— ﬂame strike (DC 17) , freedom of movement .",

A dread pirate, however, has mastered every aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network of contacts tells him when a particularly valuable cargo is shipping out. After a ﬂawless ambush at sea, he swings aboard the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand. Once he and his shipmates have overpowered the prize vessel’s crew, they liberate the cargo and make their escape. Later, the dread pirate meets representatives from the black market in an isolated cove and sells his newly acquired cargo for a handsome proﬁt. Some dread pirates accomplish their goals through fear, killing indiscriminately and ruling their ships at rapier- point. Others minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious sort of chivalry, perhaps realizing that the captain and crew of a prize ship are more likely to surrender if they believe they will live to see port again. Now and then a dread pirate takes his chivalric streak a step farther and preys only on the ships of enemy nations—or even solely on other pirates. A dread pirate’s lifestyle is ideal for most rogues, because the job requires a number of skills that other classes don’t have the time or inclination to learn. How - ever, the class also attracts some spellcasters, who can use magic to conceal their ships or incapacitate a prize vessel’s crew.",

        "description":  "6 + Int modiﬁer. CLASS FEATURES All of the following are class features of the dread pirate prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Dread pirates are proﬁcient with all simple weapons, with light martial weapons, and with the rapier. Dread pirates are proﬁcient with light armor but not with shields. Seamanship (Ex):  A dread pirate adds his class level as an insight bonus on all Profession (sailor) checks. Allies within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight bonus equal to half this number on their Profession (sailor) checks. Two-Weapon Fighting: A dread pirate wearing light or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the feat. Fearsome Reputation (Ex): By the time he attains 2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding undue bloodshed, honoring ﬂags of truce, and the like) or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire treatment of prisoners). An honorable dread pirate gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks, while a dishonorable one gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at 10th level. In addition, a dread pirate gains other abilities at higher levels based on his chosen reputation. A dread pirate’s actual activities or alignment need not match his reputation. However, a radical shift away from his reputation might negate or even reverse that reputation at the DM’s option. Also, a dread pirate in disguise does not gain any effect granted by his reputa - tion (including the special abilities described below that depend on the dread pirate’s reputation). Rally the Crew (Ex):  Starting at 3rd level, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 40CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 41charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally must be able to see or hear the dread pirate. The effect requires a free action to activate and lasts for 1 minute per class level, even if the dread pirate moves out of range or loses consciousness. This is a mind-affecting ability. At 7th level, a dread pirate can use this ability twice per day, and the bonus in-creases to +2. If a dread pirate has the inspire cour-age bardic music ability, he can add the morale bonus gained from that ability to the morale bonus gained from this ability to deter-mine the total morale bonus granted. For example, an 8th-level bard/3rd-level dread pirate would provide a +3 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a dishonorable dread pirate deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂ  anking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . The amount of extra damage dealt increases to 2d6 at 7th level. If a dishonorable dread pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Acrobatic Charge (Ex): A dread pirate of 4th level or higher can charge over difﬁ  cult terrain that normally slows movement or through the squares occupied by allies blocking his path. This ability enables him to charge across a cluttered ship’s deck, leap down from a higher deck, or swing between two adjacent ships to get to his target. Depending on the circumstances, he might still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain. Steady Stance (Ex):  At 4th level and higher, a dread pirate remains stable on his feet when others have difﬁ  culty standing. He is not considered ﬂ  at-footed while balancing or climbing, and he adds his class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when he takes damage. Luck of the Wind (Ex): Once per day, an honorable dread pirate of 5th level or higher can reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. Scourge of the Seas (Ex): Start- ing at 5th level, a dishonorable dread pirate can instill fear into his enemies. When the character uses Intimidate to demoralize foes, the at- tempt affects all enemies within 30 feet who can see and hear him, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modiﬁ  er (minimum 1 round). Multiple uses of this ability don’t stack. This is a mind-affect- ing ability. Skill Mastery (Ex):  At 8th level, a dread pirate becomes supremely conﬁ  dent of his mobil- ity. He has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress. Fight to the Death (Ex): At 9th level and higher, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies to carry on against tremendous odds. Each ally affected by the dread pirate’s rally the crew ability (see above) also gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + the dread pirate’s Cha bonus (minimum 10), gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to the dread pirate’s Cha bonus (minimum +1), and is treated as having the Diehard feat even if he doesn’t meet the prerequisites. These effects are lost if the dread pirate loses consciousness. Motivate the Scum (Ex):  Once per day, a dishonorable dread pirate of 9th level or higher can motivate his allies by killing a helpless individual. All allies of the dread pirate who see the act gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls. This effect lasts for 24 hours. Most dishonorable dread pirates don’t care whether the victim is a prisoner or one of their own crew. In fact, if the slain individual is one of the dread pirate’s crew, the morale bonus on damage rolls improves to +4, but the allies also take a –2 penalty on Will saves for the duration of the effect. Pirate King (Ex): A 10th-level dread pirate’s exploits have become so legendary that great numbers of able sailors are willing to sign on as his crew for no compen- sation other than a share of the booty. Treat this ability as the equivalent of the Leadership feat, except that only followers (and no cohorts) are gained.

Spencer pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs THE PIRATE CODE Most pirate codes share a number of elements regarding the proper “etiquette” of piracy. Here are a few ideas that might be appropriate for your dread pirate’s personal code: •  Everyone shall obey all orders. •  Everyone shall have a vote in major decisions. (This point is not necessarily limited to honorable dread pirates.) •  Everyone shall have a share of captured food and drink. •  Booty will be shared out as follows: one share to each among the crew; one and one-half shares each to the first mate, master carpenter, and boatswain; and two shares to the captain. (Some honorable captains might accept a smaller share, but they will take no fewer than one and one-half shares.) •  Anyone not keeping his weapons clean and fit for an engage- ment shall be cut off from his share, and suffer other punish- ment as the captain deems fit. •  Anyone who strikes another among the crew shall receive forty lashes across his back. •  Anyone who attempts to desert or keep any secret from the company shall be marooned with one bottle of water and one weapon. •  Anyone who steals from a crewmate shall be marooned or run through. (The latter consequence is more appropriate for dishonorable dread pirates.) pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 40CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 41charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.

        "description":  "8 + Int modiﬁer.CLASS FEATURES All of the following are class features of the dungeon delver prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Dungeon delvers gain no proﬁciency with any weapon or armor. Darkvision (Ex): A dungeon delver’s long exposure to pitch-black subterranean surroundings enables him to develop darkvision out to 60 feet. If the character already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. Deep Survival (Ex):  A dun - geon delver’s experience in deep, dark places grants him a great familiarity with that world. He adds his class level to Survival checks made in underground environments. Trap Sense (Ex):  A dungeon delver is adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbar - ian class feature, page 26 of the Player’s Handbook. The bonuses rise by 1 for every three addi - tional dungeon delver levels gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level) and stack with similar bonuses granted by other classes. Reduce (Sp): A dungeon delver frequently ﬁnds it nec - essary to squeeze through narrow crevices, half-col - lapsed passages, prison bars, and other tight spots that would normally block a character of his size and bulk. Starting at 2nd level, a dungeon delver can use re - duce person on himself three times per day (regardless of his creature type). His caster level is equal to his class level. Stonecunning (Ex): At 2nd level, a dungeon delver gains the stonecunning ability. This functions exactly as the dwarf racial trait of the same name (see page 15 of the Player’s Handbook ), except that the check modiﬁers are competence bonuses rather than racial bonuses. If a dungeon delver already has stonecunning because of his race, both sets of bonuses apply. Augury (Sp):  Beginning at 3rd level, a dungeon delver can foretell whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for him in the immediate future. Once per day, he can use augury  as a free action; his caster level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every three additional class levels gained (2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level). Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, a dungeon delver becomes so conﬁdent in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. The character selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence modiﬁer. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook. Evasion (Ex):  Beginning at 4th level, a dungeon delver can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reﬂex save. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player’s Handbook. If a dungeon delver already has evasion, he gains improved evasion instead, allowing him to avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reﬂex save and take only half damage on a failed save. See the monk class feature, page 42 of the Player’s Handbook. Blindsense (Ex):  At 5th level, a dun - geon delver gains the ability to activate an acute sensitivity to sounds, smells, movement, and other disturbances within 30 feet. This functions as described on page 306 of the Monster Manual and lasts for 1 minute per class level. A dungeon delver can use blindsense once per day at 5th level and twice per day at 10th level. Passwall (Sp):  Starting at 6th level, a dungeon delver can use passwall  once per day as a caster of his class level. This ability comes in handy for bypassing small cave-ins or sneak - ing into vaults. Find the Path (Sp): Starting at 8th level, a dungeon delver can use ﬁnd the path  twice per day as a caster of his class level. Typically, a delver uses this to ﬁnd his way into and out of confounding mazes and dungeons. He can target only himself with the ability. Phase Door (Sp): At 9th level, a dungeon delver gains the ability to use phase door once per day as an 18th-level caster. This ability enables him to bypass cave-ins, walk through dead ends and immovable obstructions, and make quick escapes through walls.Morzul Darkhunter, a dungeon delverIlllus. by S. BelledinCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 42CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 43 Inspire Courage (Su):  Use music or poetics to bolster his allies against fear and improve their combat abilities. Rally the Crew (Ex):  Once per day, Daniel can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat, granting them a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally must be able to see or hear Daniel. The effect requires a free action to activate and lasts for 4 minutes, even if Daniel moves out of range or loses consciousness. This is a mind-affecting ability. Steady Stance (Ex):  Daniel is not considered ﬂat-footed while balancing or climbing, and he gains a +4 bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when he takes damage. Bard  Spells Known (3/2; caster level 3rd): 0— dancing lights, daze (DC 12), ghost sound (DC 12), know direction, mage hand, message; 1st— animate rope, inspirational boost †, sleep (DC 13).",

        "description":  "8 + Int modiﬁer.CLASS FEATURES All of the following are class features of the dungeon delver prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Dungeon delvers gain no proﬁciency with any weapon or armor. Darkvision (Ex): A dungeon delver’s long exposure to pitch-black subterranean surroundings enables him to develop darkvision out to 60 feet. If the character already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. Deep Survival (Ex):  A dun - geon delver’s experience in deep, dark places grants him a great familiarity with that world. He adds his class level to Survival checks made in underground environments. Trap Sense (Ex):  A dungeon delver is adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbar - ian class feature, page 26 of the Player’s Handbook. The bonuses rise by 1 for every three addi - tional dungeon delver levels gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level) and stack with similar bonuses granted by other classes. Reduce (Sp): A dungeon delver frequently ﬁnds it nec - essary to squeeze through narrow crevices, half-col - lapsed passages, prison bars, and other tight spots that would normally block a character of his size and bulk. Starting at 2nd level, a dungeon delver can use re - duce person on himself three times per day (regardless of his creature type). His caster level is equal to his class level. Stonecunning (Ex): At 2nd level, a dungeon delver gains the stonecunning ability. This functions exactly as the dwarf racial trait of the same name (see page 15 of the Player’s Handbook ), except that the check modiﬁers are competence bonuses rather than racial bonuses. If a dungeon delver already has stonecunning because of his race, both sets of bonuses apply. Augury (Sp):  Beginning at 3rd level, a dungeon delver can foretell whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for him in the immediate future. Once per day, he can use augury  as a free action; his caster level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every three additional class levels gained (2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level).

A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of it can make a Search check as if actively searching. Morzul adds his racial bonuses to his dungeon delver class bonuses to determine his total stonecunning bonuses. When standing on the ground, dwarves are exception - ally stable and have a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped. Dwarves have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids and a +4 racial bonus to Armor Class against giants. Their race also gives them a +2 bonus on Appraise or Craft checks that are related to stone or metal items. *Dwarves have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. Evasion (Ex): If Morzul is exposed to any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Reduce (Sp): Morzul can use reduce person (self only) three times per day. Caster level 3rd. Skill Mastery (Ex): Morzul has mastered the skills Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, and Search to the extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress. These skills are designated by SM in the statistics block. Sneak Attack (Ex): Morzul deals an extra 4d6  points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Morzul can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Trapﬁnding (Ex): Morzul can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Morzul retains his Dexterity bonus to AC even when ﬂat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).",

Weapon and Armor Proﬁ  ciency: Fochlucan lyrists gain no proﬁ  ciency with any weapon or armor. Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a Fochlucan lyrist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class and any one divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other beneﬁ  t a character of that class would have gained. If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class or divine spellcasting class before becoming a Fochlucan lyrist, she must decide to which class to add each Fochlu- can lyrist level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level. For example, a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level bard/4th-level druid/3rd-level Fochlucan lyrist can cast arcane spells as an 8th-level bard and divine spells as a 7th-level druid. Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A Fochlucan lyrist can attempt to recall some relevant piece of information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. See the bard class feature, page 28 of the Player’s Handbook. She adds her Fochlucan lyrist class level to her bardic knowledge checks, so her bardic knowledge checks have a bonus equal to her bard level + her Fochlu- can lyrist level + her Int modiﬁ  er. Bardic Music: A Fochlucan lyrist adds her lyrist level to her bard level to determine the number of times per day she can use her bardic music, the bardic music abilities she can employ, and the power of those abilities. For example, a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level bard/4th-level druid/3rd-level Fochlucan lyrist can use her bardic music eight times per day, can use any bardic music ability an 8th-level bard could use (assuming she meets the Perform skill rank requirements), and is treated as an 8th-level bard for adjudicating the effects of those abilities (such as number of targets, save DC, and so forth).",

No one ever discovered the clan’s honorless actions, and to this day, no one knows what clan the ghost-faced killers came from. Today ghost- faced killers act as assassins and spies for hire, a mercenary clan that hides behind a guise of open and honorable con - duct. When on a mission, they wear porcelain demon- masks of ghostly white to hide their identities and as a symbol of the pact their clan made with the demon-spir - its. Through training and discipline, ghost-faced killers learn the deadliest and most terrifying ways to attack foes, and through their mystic con - nection with spirits, ghost-faced killers learn to turn invisible, walk through walls, and even see with the eyes of the spirits them - selves. Most ghost-faced killers be - gin their careers as rangers or rogues, though ninjas are also common. Fighters are only slightly less common. Few monks, barbarians, or members of spell - casting classes choose to become ghost-faced killers, but such char - acters are not unknown. NPC ghost-faced killers are members of the Ghost-Faced Killer clan of ninjas. This clan disguises itself as a normal samurai clan, loyal to the empire but unworthy of notice. Most of the time a ghost-faced killer simply pursues his responsi - bilities to the clan and the emperor, but when called by money or the clan daimyo the ghost-faced killer dons the mask that means death for his enemies.",

        "description":  "4 + Int modiﬁer. CLASS FEATURES All of the following are features of the ghost-faced killer prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Ghost-faced killers are proﬁcient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor. Ghost Step (Su):  A ghost-faced killer can become invisible for 1 round once per day. Using this ability is a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A ghost-faced killer can use this ability one additional time per day for every three class levels gained above 1st (2/day at 4th level, 3/day at 7th level, and 4/day at 10th level). At 6th level, a ghost-faced killer can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible. Sudden Strike (Ex):  If a ghost-faced killer of 2nd level or higher can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ghost-faced killer’s target is denied her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) against his attack, the ghost-faced killer deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with his attack. The bonus damage increases by 1d6 every three levels (+2d6 at 5th level, +3d6 at 8th level). This ability otherwise works like the ninja ability described on page 8. Frightful Attack (Su):  Beginning at 3rd level, a ghost- faced killer can panic onlookers and even frighten his victim to death by making a sudden strike attack. Once per day, a ghost-faced killer can designate a melee sudden strike attack as a frightful attack. The ghost-faced killer must use his Power Attack feat on the attack and must take a penalty of at least –1 to his attack roll. If the attack deals damage to the target, the victim must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer’s class level + ghost-faced killer’s Cha modiﬁer). If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 1 round per class level of the ghost-faced killer; if she fails, she instantly dies of fear. Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with Hit Dice that exceed the ghost-faced killer’s character level are immune to this frightful attack. In addition, all creatures within 30 feet who see the frightful attack (not including the victim, the ghost-faced killer, or the ghost-faced killer’s allies) become panicked (if their Hit Dice are less than the ghost-faced killer’s class level + his Cha modiﬁer) or shaken (if their Hit Dice equal or exceed the ghost-faced killer’s class level + Cha modiﬁer) for 1 round per class level of the ghost- faced killer. A successful Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer’s class level + ghost-faced killer’s Cha modiﬁer + damage bonus from Power Attack on the frightful attack) negates this effect. A ghost-faced killer can use this ability one additional time per day for every three levels gained above 3rd (2/day at 6th level, 3/day at 9th level). Ghost Sight (Su): Starting at 7th level, a ghost-faced killer can see ethereal and invisible creatures and objects as easily as he sees material creatures and objects. Frightful Cleave (Su): If a 10th-level ghost-faced killer slays a foe with his frightful attack (either from the damage dealt or because of a failed save against its fear effect), he gets an immediate extra melee attack against another target within reach. If the new target is ﬂat-footed, this extra attack is also a frightful attack, though it doesn’t count against the ghost-faced killer’s daily limit of frightful attacks.

Evasion (Ex): If Qeng Yi is exposed to any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Frightful Attack (Su): Once per day, Qeng Yi can designate a melee sudden strike attack as a frightful attack. He must use his Power Attack feat and take an attack roll penalty of at least –1.

PhillippiCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 54CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 55If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 3 rounds; if she fails, she instantly dies of fear. Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with 10 Hit Dice or more are immune to Qeng Yi’s frightful attack. All other creatures within 30 feet who see the fright - ful attack (not including Qeng Yi or his allies) become panicked (if of 1 Hit Die or less) or shaken (if of 2 Hit Dice or more) for 3 rounds (Will negates, DC 12 + damage bonus from Power Attack). Ghost Step (Su): Qeng Yi can become invisible for 1 round once per day. This is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137 ). Sneak Attack (Ex): Qeng Yi deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern - ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Qeng Yi can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Sudden Strike (Ex):  Qeng Yi deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This extra damage stacks with extra damage from a sneak attack, so Qeng Yi deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against ﬂat-footed foes, but only an extra 1d6 points of damage against ﬂanked foes. See page 8 for details. Trapﬁnding (Ex): Qeng Yi can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.",

HIGHLAND STALKER The mountains are unforgiving, and the ability to ﬁnd food at high altitude often means the difference between survival and starvation. For those who live in such climes, hunters provide not only food but also clothing, shelter, and tools when they bring back animal skins and bones. The best high-altitude hunters—highland stalkers—are consummate trackers with an instinctive knowledge of their mountainous territories.

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Highland stalkers are proﬁcient with light armor. They gain no proﬁciency with any weapon. Mountain Stride (Ex): A highland stalker can move through scree and dense rubble at her normal speed. She can also move up steep slopes and stairs at her normal speed. See pages 89–92 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for descriptions of terrain types. Skirmish (Ex): A highland stalker relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. Starting at 2nd level, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. This extra damage applies only to attacks taken during her turn. It increases by an additional 1d6 for every four levels gained above 2nd (2d6 at 6th and 3d6 at 10th). This extra damage only applies against living crea - tures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this extra damage. A highland stalker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Highland stalkers can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 4th level, a highland stalker gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as she has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. It improves to +2 at 8th level. A highland stalker loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack. Swift Tracker (Ex): Begin - ning at 3rd level, a highland stalker can move at her normal speed while following tracks. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Player’s Handbook. Surefooted (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a highland stalker is well acquainted with the dangers of mountain - ous terrain. She can ignore DC modiﬁers on Balance, Move Silently, and Tumble checks derived from scree, light rubble, dense rubble, steep slopes, or stairs (see page 89 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). She also does not need to make a DC 10 Balance check when running or charging down a steep slope.  Camouﬂage (Ex): Beginning at 7th level, a highland stalker can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural ter - rain.

Surefooted (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a highland stalker is well acquainted with the dangers of mountain - ous terrain. She can ignore DC modiﬁers on Balance, Move Silently, and Tumble checks derived from scree, light rubble, dense rubble, steep slopes, or stairs (see page 89 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). She also does not need to make a DC 10 Balance check when running or charging down a steep slope.  Camouﬂage (Ex): Beginning at 7th level, a highland stalker can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural ter - rain.

Maesters often hire bodyguards if they’re undertaking a journey, paying their guards with magic items they have built.

        "description":  "4 + Int modiﬁer. CLASS FEATURES All of the following are class features of the nightsong enforcer prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Nightsong enforc - ers are not proﬁcient with any weapon. They are proﬁcient with light armor but not with shields. Sneak Attack (Ex): A nightsong enforcer deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 4th level, 3d6 points at 7th level, and 4d6 points at 10th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a nightsong enforcer gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Teamwork (Ex): Nightsong enforcers are trained to keep a close eye on teammates on a joint mission. A nightsong enforcer gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Listen and Spot checks to hear and see allies. At 9th level, a nightsong enforcer’s senses are honed so ﬁnely that she is aware of the location and status (as with the status spell) of all allies within 100 feet, even if they are not within sight. Agility Training (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a night - song enforcer reduces the armor check penalty imposed on her by light armor by 2 (to a minimum of 0). Skill Teamwork (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a nightsong enforcer can use her training to improve the skill of those around her. All allies within 30 feet of the nightsong enforcer gain a +2 competence bonus on Bal - ance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks. Allies must be able to see the nightsong enforcer to gain this bonus. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Teamwork (Ex): Nightsong enforcers are trained to keep a close eye on teammates on a joint mission. A nightsong enforcer gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Listen and Spot checks to hear and see allies. At 9th level, a nightsong enforcer’s senses are honed so ﬁnely that she is aware of the location and status (as with the status spell) of all allies within 100 feet, even if they are not within sight.

Raelia Jaessin, a nightsong inﬁ  ltratorKarsta Longﬁ  st, a nightsong enforcerIllus. by J. MiracolaCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 64CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 65 Steady Stance (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a night - song inﬁltrator remains stable on her feet when others have difﬁculty standing. She is not considered ﬂat-footed while balancing or climbing, and she adds her class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balanc - ing or climbing when she takes damage. Teamwork  Inﬁltration (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a nightsong inﬁltrator can study a small area (typically up to 10 feet square, such as a doorway or guard post) in order to prepare for inﬁltrating that area. If the inﬁltra - tor spends 1 hour studying the area from a distance of no more than 60 feet, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, Disable Device, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Search, and Tumble checks attempted in that area for the next 24 hours. All allies within 30 feet of the inﬁltrator gain the same bonus in that area. (The allies need not be present while the inﬁltrator studies the area.) At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4. Break Away (Ex): Skilled as she is, a nightsong inﬁltrator knows the sensibility of falling back from an unwinnable ﬁght. Starting at 3rd level, she gains a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class in any round during which she does nothing but move. A nightsong inﬁltrator can grant this ability to an ally within 30 feet as a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137 ). It lasts for 1 round. Trackless Step (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, a nightsong inﬁltrator cannot be tracked in natural sur - roundings. See the druid class feature, page 36 of the Player’s Handbook. At 7th level and higher, a nightsong inﬁltrator can share this ability with up to one additional ally per class level. Designating an ally for trackless step requires a standard action and lasts for 24 hours or until the inﬁltra - tor dismisses the effect (a standard action). Detect Magic (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a nightsong inﬁltrator can use detect magic at will. See the spell, page 219 of the Player’s Handbook . Teamwork Sneak Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 4th level, a nightsong inﬁltrator deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. Any ally of the inﬁltrator who is also ﬂanking the inﬁltrator’s opponent deals this extra damage as well. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook .  If a nightsong inﬁltrator or her ally gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Defensive Roll (Ex):  Starting at 5th level, a nightsong inﬁltrator can attempt to roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook . Grant Move Action (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a nightsong inﬁltrator can direct and motivate her allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a standard action, she can grant an extra move action to any or all of her allies within 30 feet (but not herself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies’ initiative count; the round continues normally after the inﬁltrator’s turn is over. Starting at 9th level, a nightsong inﬁltrator can use this ability twice per day. Improved Evasion (Ex): If a nightsong inﬁltrator of 6th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails. Skill Mastery (Ex):  At 6th level, a nightsong inﬁl - trator has become so conﬁdent in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, or Search check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Specialized Tools (Ex):  After studying an area (see teamwork inﬁltration, above), a nightsong inﬁltrator of 6th level or higher can prepare a special tool for a job. Doing this requires 1 hour, a DC 15 Craft check (the speciﬁc type of Craft specialty required is up to the DM; blacksmithing, leatherworking, or woodworking are all likely candidates), and a set of artisan’s tools for the Craft skill in question. The tool prepared by the inﬁltrator grants a +4 circumstance bonus on all checks made with one of the following skills: Climb, Disable Device, Disguise, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Search, or Sleight of Hand. This bonus doesn’t stack with the circumstance bonus granted by any other set of tools (such as a disguise kit or masterwork thieves’ tools). The tool works only in the studied area, and it works only for 24 hours (though the inﬁltrator can rebuild the tool by following the same process). Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): A 10th-level nightsong inﬁltrator can can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being observed. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Player’s Handbook .

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Ollams are proﬁ - cient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  At 2nd, 3rd, and 4th level, an ollam gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, how - ever, gain any other beneﬁt a charac - ter of that class would have gained. If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an ollam, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. If an ollam had no levels in a spellcasting class before taking the prestige class, at 2nd level she gains the spellcasting abilities of a cleric whose caster level is one lower than her class level. Lore (Ex):  An ollam has the abil - ity to recall legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. See the bardic knowledge class feature, page 29 of the Player’s Handbook. An ollam adds her class level and her Intelligence modiﬁer to her lore check. If the character has a similar ability from another class (such as bardic knowledge), her ollam levels stack with class levels from that other class to determine the success of the lore check. Inspire Competence (Su): An ollam of 3rd level or higher can use oratory to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on checks with a particular skill. If the ally is a dwarf, the competence bonus increases to +3. See the bardic music class feature, page 29 of the Player’s Handbook . If an ollam has the inspire competence bardic music ability, she can expend one daily use of her bardic music to increase the competence bonus to +4 (or +6 if the ally is a dwarf). Inspire Resilience (Su): From an early age, dwarves learn to approach life with steadfast resolution and endur - ance. A 5th-level ollam can spend a standard action to use oratory to tap into this power, granting a single dwarf ally a +4 competence bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves, as well as damage reduction 5/—. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the ollam. The ollam must also be able to see the ally. The effect lasts for as long as the ollam orates and for 1 minute thereafter. Allies who are not dwarves instead gain a +2 compe - tence bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves, gain no damage reduction, and are fatigued at the end of the duration.

BelledinCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 66CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 67OLLAM In Dwarven, the word “ollam” means teacher. The educa - tion of the dwarf people is considered a sacred duty, and those who are considered knowledgeable in dwarf his - tory and legend—and thought to possess above-average common sense—are often called upon to take up the respected role of teacher in the community. While other cultures might see this as a job for young girls or old men, the dwarves see an ollam as a protector of their cherished culture. No one in the dwarf community takes that position lightly. An ollam is granted a special position in the temple hierarchy—Moradin gives her spells that allow her not only to delve into the secrets of the universe but also to heal and keep an eye on her charges. While most ollams are clerics or bards, individuals of other classes are welcomed, as long as they possess the knowledge needed to teach the children properly. NPC ollams are equally likely to be safely ensconced in the heart of a dwarf community, passing on the accumulated lore of their people, or wandering the lands, sharing their knowl - edge with dwarves and nondwarves alike. If there’s something going on in a dwarf city, you can count on the ollams knowing about it ﬁrst. They’re uncommonly well connected with each clan and stratum of dwarf society.",

BelledinCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 68CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 69SHADOWBANE INQUISITOR Clad in bone-white armor and wreathed in righteous conviction, shadowbane inquisitors battle incessantly against evil in whatever form it takes. Every shadowbane inquisitor belongs to a fellowship of religious knights called the Order of Illumination (see page 179). The order advocates merciless aggression against evil, and its members train to detect and destroy evil creatures and individuals. Filled with fervor, an inquisitor knows only one solution to an infestation of evil: the sword. The purifying ﬂame and the clean cut of a holy blade are his tools. Along with their comrades (as members of the order refer to one another) the shadowbane stalkers, inquisi - tors ﬁnd and confront evil wherever it hides. Unlike shadowbane stalkers, however, inquisitors emphasize purging evil rather than ﬁnding it. Their relentless zeal and their overwhelming belief in their own righteousness allow shadowbane inquisitors to root out evil cleanly, even if it costs the lives of a few good creatures, without the moral doubt that other knights might feel. The Order of Illumination expounds that it is better to sacriﬁce a village that hides a powerful demon than it is to risk letting the demon escape or the evil spread. Although inquisitors remain devoted to the cause of good, this conviction allows them to use their  abilities against enemies regardless of their alignment. Inquisitors must watch shadowbane stalkers carefully to make sure they do not slip into darkness—stalkers are willing to use subterfuge to ﬁnd evil where it hides, and subtlety and stealth are tools of evil. This situation occasionally puts the two branches of the Order of Illumination at odds, but the order as a whole remains zealously dedicated to good. Almost all shadowbane inquisitors were once paladins who took a few levels of rogue to better understand and combat the subtle forces of evil. This unusual class combination gives the inquisitor a remarkable ability to resist the manipulations of evil creatures and confront them without fear. Some cleric/rogues become inquisi - tors, sacriﬁcing their study of divine magic in order to perfect their combat abilities.",

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Shadowbane inquisitors are proﬁcient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (except tower shields). Absolute Conviction (Ex): Should a shadowbane inquisitor’s alignment ever change from lawful good for any reason, he may not take additional levels in this prestige class, but he does not lose any class abilities from levels already attained. Pierce Shadows (Su): A shadowbane inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to shed a holy radiance. This light brightly illuminates an area in a radius of 20 feet plus 5 feet per class level of the inquisitor. The light is centered on the inquisitor and sheds no shadowy illumination beyond its border. This radiance lasts for 10 minutes per inquisitor class level. Sacred Stealth (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a shadow - bane inquisitor can channel some of his divine spell power to become stealthier. To do this, he must lose a prepared divine spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). He gains a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) plus the level of spell given up in this manner. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +8. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137 ). Smite (Su):  Once per day, a shadowbane inquisitor of 2nd level or higher can attempt to smite a creature that he judges to be corrupt with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per inquisitor class level. Unlike with a paladin’s smite evil ability, an inquisitor relies only on his own judgment when determining what creatures to use this ability against. How an inquisitor uses this ability exempliﬁes his outlook on the world. The more suspicious and uncompromising an inquisitor is, the more likely he is to feel that a creature should be struck down. An inquisitor can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 10th level.",

        "description":  "At 3rd level, a shadowbane becomes accomplished at shattering the weapons of his foes and tainted magic items. He gains the Improved Sunder feat as a bonus feat. Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, a shad - owbane inquisitor deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 7th level and 3d6 points at 10th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook. If a shadowbane inquisitor gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Merciless Purity (Su): Beginning at 5th level, a shadowbane inquisitor beneﬁts when his enemies perish. Upon the death of a creature that the inquisitor has designated as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on his Fortitude and Reﬂex saves for the next 24 hours. An inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt in his eyes by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. The inquisitor need not kill the creature himself. An inquisitor can beneﬁt from this ability only once per day; subsequent deaths of creatures that he has designated as corrupt grant no special beneﬁt. Righteous Fervor (Su): When an inquisitor of 8th level or higher designates a creature as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for the rest of the encounter. The inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. This bonus does not apply to the smite attempt itself, only to subsequent attacks against the same creature made in that encounter. Burning Light (Su): At 9th level and higher, an inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to deal damage to creatures around him. To do this, he must already have his pierce shadows ability active. All creatures within the illuminated area (except for the inquisitor) take 4d6 points of damage. This damage results directly from divine power and is not subject to being reduced by energy resistance. Using this ability requires a standard action.",

Unlike with a paladin’s smite evil ability, an inquisitor relies only on his own judgment when determining what creatures to use this ability against. How an inquisitor uses this ability exempliﬁes his outlook on the world. The more suspicious and uncompromising an inquisitor is, the more likely he is to feel that a creature should be struck down. An inquisitor can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 10th level.",

        "description":  "At 3rd level, a shadowbane becomes accomplished at shattering the weapons of his foes and tainted magic items. He gains the Improved Sunder feat as a bonus feat. Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, a shad - owbane inquisitor deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 7th level and 3d6 points at 10th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook. If a shadowbane inquisitor gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Merciless Purity (Su): Beginning at 5th level, a shadowbane inquisitor beneﬁts when his enemies perish. Upon the death of a creature that the inquisitor has designated as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on his Fortitude and Reﬂex saves for the next 24 hours. An inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt in his eyes by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. The inquisitor need not kill the creature himself. An inquisitor can beneﬁt from this ability only once per day; subsequent deaths of creatures that he has designated as corrupt grant no special beneﬁt. Righteous Fervor (Su): When an inquisitor of 8th level or higher designates a creature as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for the rest of the encounter. The inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. This bonus does not apply to the smite attempt itself, only to subsequent attacks against the same creature made in that encounter. Burning Light (Su): At 9th level and higher, an inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to deal damage to creatures around him. To do this, he must already have his pierce shadows ability active. All creatures within the illuminated area (except for the inquisitor) take 4d6 points of damage. This damage results directly from divine power and is not subject to being reduced by energy resistance. Using this ability requires a standard action.",

She gains a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) plus the level of spell given up in this manner. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +8. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern - ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Farsi can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Detect Evil ( Sp): Farsi can use detect evil at will. See the spell, page 218 of the Player’s Handbook . Evasion (Ex):  If Farsi is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Sacred Stealth (Su): Farsi can lose a prepared divine spell from memory to gain a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to the level of spell given up in this manner.

        "description":  "At every level indicated on the accompanying table, a shadowmind gains additional power points per day and access to new discovered powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever psionic manifesting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other beneﬁt a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one psionic class before becoming a shadowmind, she must decide to which class to add the new level of shadowmind for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level. Read Thoughts (Ps): At 1st level, a shadowmind adds read  thoughts to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest read thoughts at a reduced power point cost. The cost of read thoughts is reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Sneak Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 2nd level, a shad - owmind deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level and 3d6 points at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a shadowmind gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Cloud Mind (Ps): At 3rd level, a shadowmind adds cloud  mind to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest cloud mind at a reduced power point cost. The cost of cloud mind is reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Mass Cloud Mind (Ps): At 9th level, a shadowmind adds mass cloud  mind to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest mass cloud mind at a reduced power point cost. The cost of mass cloud mind  is reduced by the shadowmind’s level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Mind Stab (Su):  A 10th-level shadowmind can combine a precise blow with a burst of mental energy, removing her presence from the mind and memory of her victim even as she stabs him. Once per round as a free action, immediately after successfully dealing sneak attack damage to an opponent, a shadowmind can manifest cloud mind against that opponent.Mysk, a shadowmind Table 2–20: The Shadowmind Base Attack Fort Ref WillLevel Bonus Save Save Save Special Powers Known 1st +0 +0 +2 +2 Read thoughts +1 level of existing manifesting class 2nd +1 +0 +3 +3 Sneak attack +1d6 —  3rd +2 +1 +3 +3 Cloud mind +1 level of existing manifesting class 4th +3 +1 +4 +4 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 5th +3 +1 +4 +4 Sneak attack +2d6 —  6th +4 +2 +5 +5 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 7th +5 +2 +5 +5 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 8th +6 +2 +6 +6 Sneak attack +3d6 —  9th +6 +3 +6 +6 Mass cloud mind +1 level of existing manifesting class 10th +7 +3 +7 +7 Mind stab +1 level of existing manifesting classIllus. by M.

SPYMASTER Some adventurers glory in their reputations—the wider their exploits are known, the happier they are. By contrast, the spymaster prefers to avoid attention. She does her work quietly and in private, keeping well away from public scrutiny. To allay suspicions, she often maintains a cover identity by pretending to be a member of some other class—typically the one in which she began her career. Spymasters are rarely popular, but so long as nation distrusts nation there will be work for those who can gather information that others wish to keep hidden. Many a ruler who publicly claims to abhor spymasters secretly employs a stable of them, if only to protect his own secrets from the spymasters of other nations. This set of circumstances, plus the secrecy inherent in the profession of spymaster and its high mortality rate, makes it impossible to determine how many spymasters are active in a setting at any given time. Rogues make excellent spymasters because of their generous skill allotments and their propensity for sneaki- ness. Likewise, rangers have an edge when operating as spymasters in outdoor surroundings. However, a character of any class can become a spymaster—the more unlikely the combination may seem, the better the cover it provides. Some wizards and sorcerers use their spell ability as a cover for subterfuge, and some barbarians are far more subtle than they seem. Spymasters can be of any alignment. They range from self-serving information brokers who sell their services to the highest bidder to high-minded moles who penetrate and destroy corrupt organizations. It’s important for a spymaster to keep her personal emotions distinct from her professional attachments. She must be ready to liquidate someone she has come to like without a moment’s thought if so ordered. Betrayal is her business, and her loyalty is always to her mission, not to the people she encounters while carrying it out. Occasionally, a spymaster may ﬁ  nd it expedient to inﬁ  ltrate an adventuring party heading for the area where her real mission lies. In such a case, she behaves in all ways as a loyal party member until her goals and those of her companions diverge.Adaptation:  Nearly undetectable and constantly covering their tracks, spymasters are easily included in a campaign as single NPCs or villains. Spymasters work best on their own or with a small group of adventuring companions of other classes, so incorporating them into a campaign doesn’t usually involve creating spy- master-speciﬁ  c organizations. Rather, spymasters serve as the eyes and ears of many organizations. Several of the organizations described in Chapter 6 of this book might make use of one or more high-level spymasters to train other members, keep tabs on rival organiza- tions, and undertake special missions not suitable for the talents of their regular members. Every kingdom has or wants as many spymasters in its employ as possible, and many who have the talent for such work ﬁ  nd themselves carefully watched and encouraged by agents of the crown.",

Thus, a spymaster must be careful to choose identities that can withstand ordinary scrutiny. Gilifar, a spymaster Illus. by S. EllisCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 78CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 79 Undetectable Alignment (Ex):  The web of different identities and agendas inside a spymaster’s mind makes it impossible for others to detect her alignment by means of any form of divination. This ability functions like an undetectable alignment spell, except that it is always active. Quick Change (Ex): By 2nd level, a spymaster has become adept at quickly switching from one identity to another. She now can don a disguise in one-tenth the normal time (1d3 minutes) and don or remove armor in one-half the normal time. Scrying Defense (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a spymas - ter adds her class level to Will saves against divination (scrying) spells, as well as to Spot checks made to notice the sensors created by such spells. Magic Aura (Sp): At 3rd level, a spymaster gains the ability to use Nystul’s magic aura  at will with a caster level equal to her class level. Most spymasters use this ability to shield their own magic items from detec - tion. Sneak Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, a spymas - ter deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a spymaster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Slippery Mind (Ex):  Starting at 4th level, a spymaster has a second chance to wriggle free from any enchant - ment spells and effects. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook . Dispel Scrying (Su): At 5th level and higher, a spy - master can dispel a scrying sensor as if casting a targeted greater dispel magic. Her caster level is equal to her class level + 10. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modiﬁer. Deep Cover (Ex): At 7th level, a spymaster becomes able to quiet her mind and completely immerse herself in her cover identity. While she operates under deep cover, divination spells detect only information appropriate to her cover identity; they reveal nothing relating to her spymaster persona. SAMPLE SPYMASTER",

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Streetﬁghters gain no proﬁciency with any weapon or armor. Always Ready (Ex): A streetﬁghter knows that an attack can come from any quarter, and that an innocuous conversation can turn into a deadly ﬁght in an instant. Accordingly, he gains a +1 competence bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level and to +3 at 5th level. Streetwise (Ex):  A streetﬁghter knows how to survive in dangerous urban areas; he gains a +2 competence bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks. Stand Tough (Ex): A streetﬁghter’s toughness has been honed by years of hard living and dirty ﬁghting. Starting at 2nd level, a streetﬁghter can stand tough once per day. When he would be damaged in combat (from a weapon or some other blow, but not from a spell or special ability), he can attempt to shake off the damage.

This ability functions like an undetectable alignment spell, except that it is always active. Quick Change (Ex): By 2nd level, a spymaster has become adept at quickly switching from one identity to another. She now can don a disguise in one-tenth the normal time (1d3 minutes) and don or remove armor in one-half the normal time. Scrying Defense (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a spymas - ter adds her class level to Will saves against divination (scrying) spells, as well as to Spot checks made to notice the sensors created by such spells. Magic Aura (Sp): At 3rd level, a spymaster gains the ability to use Nystul’s magic aura  at will with a caster level equal to her class level. Most spymasters use this ability to shield their own magic items from detec - tion. Sneak Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, a spymas - ter deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a spymaster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Slippery Mind (Ex):  Starting at 4th level, a spymaster has a second chance to wriggle free from any enchant - ment spells and effects. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook . Dispel Scrying (Su): At 5th level and higher, a spy - master can dispel a scrying sensor as if casting a targeted greater dispel magic. Her caster level is equal to her class level + 10. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modiﬁer. Deep Cover (Ex): At 7th level, a spymaster becomes able to quiet her mind and completely immerse herself in her cover identity. While she operates under deep cover, divination spells detect only information appropriate to her cover identity; they reveal nothing relating to her spymaster persona. SAMPLE SPYMASTER",

Poets use colorful terms such as “dancing” to describe the movement of a tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this ﬁghting style is not about dancing, nor is it about impressing anyone—least of all poets. A tempest focuses on learning the secrets of two-weapon ﬁghting for a single purpose: the destruction of her enemies. Typically hardy individualists, tempests rarely learn their skills through formal training. Instead, they master their art through constant application of its disciplines and experimentation on their foes. Similarly, no matter how famous a tempest becomes, it’s rare for one to take on students. Their art, they say, is one that can be learned but never taught. This prestige class is open to all classes and races. Though tempests are rare, every humanoid race has boasted at least a few. Even members of the smaller races can ﬁnd the tempest’s path appealing. Elves make nimble, clever tempests whose Dexterity works to their advantage. Dwarves are the least likely to become tempests, perhaps because they favor heavy armor and heavy weapons, but some do exist.",

Evasion (Ex): If Barsh is exposed to any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Sneak Attack (Ex): Barsh deals an extra 3d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked tar - gets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Barsh can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Stand Tough (Ex): Once per day, Barsh can attempt to shake off the damage from a single blow. To do this, he must attempt a Fortitude saving throw against a DC equal to the number of points of damage dealt. If the save succeeds, he takes no lethal damage from the blow, instead taking nonlethal damage equal to half the amount of the damage that the blow would have dealt. If the save fails, he takes damage normally. Streetwise (Ex): Barsh gets a +2 competence bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks. Trapﬁnding (Ex): Barsh can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.",

Poets use colorful terms such as “dancing” to describe the movement of a tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this ﬁghting style is not about dancing, nor is it about impressing anyone—least of all poets. A tempest focuses on learning the secrets of two-weapon ﬁghting for a single purpose: the destruction of her enemies. Typically hardy individualists, tempests rarely learn their skills through formal training. Instead, they master their art through constant application of its disciplines and experimentation on their foes. Similarly, no matter how famous a tempest becomes, it’s rare for one to take on students. Their art, they say, is one that can be learned but never taught. This prestige class is open to all classes and races. Though tempests are rare, every humanoid race has boasted at least a few. Even members of the smaller races can ﬁnd the tempest’s path appealing. Elves make nimble, clever tempests whose Dexterity works to their advantage. Dwarves are the least likely to become tempests, perhaps because they favor heavy armor and heavy weapons, but some do exist.",

At 4th level, this improves to reduce the effective distance of falls by 30 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player’s Handbook. If a thief-acrobat has this ability from another class, the distances stack to determine the effective reduc- tion of the falling distance. Acrobatic Charge (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a thief- acrobat can charge in situations where others cannot. She can charge over difﬁ  cult terrain that normally slows movement or through allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to charge across a cluttered battleﬁ  eld, leap down from a ledge, or swing across a chasm to get to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain. Defensive Roll (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, once per day a thief-acrobat can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook . At 5th level, a thief-acrobat can use this ability twice per day. Skill Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, a thief-acrobat has become so conﬁ  dent in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Improved Evasion (Ex): A 5th-level thief-acrobat can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful  Reﬂ  ex save and takes only half damage on a failed save.

Agile Fighting (Ex): Diana gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC. When ﬁ  ghting defensively or using total defense, this bonus becomes +3. In addition, she takes no penalty to her AC or on her melee attack rolls when kneeling, sitting, or prone.Sneak Attack (Ex): Diana deals an extra 3d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂ  at-footed or ﬂ  anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern- ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Diana can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Defensive Roll (Ex): Diana can attempt to roll with the damage when on the receiving end of an attack from a weapon that would reduce her to 0 or fewer hit points. On a successful Reﬂ  ex save (DC equal to damage from that attack), she takes only half damage. Diana can only react to attacks she is aware of; if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC for any reason, she cannot use this ability. Evasion does not apply to defensive rolls. Evasion (Ex): If Diana is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reﬂ  ex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Fast Acrobatics (Ex): Diana ignores the normal –5 penalty when making a Balance check while moving at her full normal speed. She can climb at half her speed as a move action without taking a –5 penalty on her Climb check. Finally, she can tumble at her full speed without taking the normal –10 penalty on her Tumble check. Kip Up (Ex): Diana can stand up from a prone posi- tion as a free action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.  Skill Mastery (Ex): Diana has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that she can take 10 with them even under stress. These skills are designated by SM in the statistics block. Slow Fall (Ex): A thief-acrobat within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent while falling. Diana takes damage as if the fall were 30 feet shorter than it actually is. Steady Stance (Ex):  Diana is not considered ﬂ  at-footed while balancing or climbing, and she adds +4 to Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when she takes damage. Trapﬁ  nding (Ex): Diana can ﬁ  nd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁ  nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Diana retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when ﬂ  at-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).",

VIGILANTE Some vigilantes have suffered personally at the hands of criminals and are bent on revenge. Others have lost loved ones to knives in the alleyway. Still others are atoning for the time they spent on the wrong side of the law. But they all have one thing in common: a burning desire to solve crimes and bring criminals to justice. The vigilante combines magical and mundane investi- gative techniques to assess a crime scene. He is adept at learning “the word on the street” about a crime, analyz-ing clues, and identifying likely suspects. Once on the trail, he relentlessly tails, apprehends, and interrogates a suspect until the truth comes out. Many vigilantes work for the local ruler or the city guard;  others are independent detectives-for-hire. Some even take to the streets by night to stop crimes in progress—or to keep would-be criminals from striking in the ﬁ  rst place. A bard or rogue can quickly pick up the variety of skills a vigilante needs. Rangers ﬁ  nd the class appealing because it allows them to engage in urban hunts with criminals as their prey, but they must typically multiclass as bards or rogues to qualify. Some would-be vigilantes add one or more levels of ﬁ  ghter or paladin to aid their combat prowess. An NPC vigilante might turn up just in time to save the player characters from becoming crime victims themselves. However, if they break the law on a vigilante’s home turf, they may ﬁ  nd themselves under his unwel-come scrutiny.

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Vigilantes are proﬁcient with all simple and martial weapons, plus the net. They are not proﬁcient with any type of armor or shields. Detect Evil (Sp):  A vigilante can use detect evil  at will. See the spell, page 218 of the Player’s Handbook. Spells per Day:  A vigilante has the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a vigilante spell, a vigilante must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Cha - risma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the vigilante’s Cha modiﬁer. When a vigilante gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells at 1st level), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The vigilante spell list appears below. A vigilante casts spells just as a bard does. A vigilante’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A vigilante begins play knowing two 1st-level spells of his choice. At most new vigilante levels, he gains one or more new spells known as indicated on Table 2–25: Vigilante Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a vigilante knows is not affected by his Charisma score.) Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after that, a vigilante can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This works identically to the bard’s ability to learn new spells in the place of old ones (see page 28 of the Player’s Handbook ). A vigilante’s spell list includes all spells from the bard spell list that belong to the following schools: abjuration, divination, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation. The spell list below includes all spells from the Player’s Handbook and this book that qualify. (Treat 0-level bard spells as 1st-level vigilante spells.) Streetwise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to survive in dangerous urban areas. He gains a +2 competence bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks. At 7th level, this bonus improves to +4. Smite the Guilty (Su):  Starting at 2nd level, a vigilante can attempt to smite someone whom he has personally witnessed committing a crime in his home city. He can use this ability once per day. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his melee attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per vigilante level. The smite attack must occur within three days of the crime; otherwise, the beneﬁts of this ability no longer apply. A vigilante can use this ability multiple times against the same miscreant and in response to the same incident, so long as all such uses occur within the time limit. Should a vigilante mistakenly try to punish someone who is not guilty of the crime witnessed, the beneﬁts do not apply, but the attempt still counts against the number allowed per day. A vigilante can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 10th level.Beasley “the Nightstalker” Bigums, a vigilanteIllus. by D.

Speak with Dead (Sp):  Starting at 4th level, a vigilante can use speak with dead once per day. His caster level equals his class level.

His caster level equals his class level. Mettle (Ex):  Starting at 9th level, a vigilante’s grim determination allows him to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm him. If a vigilante makes a successful Will or Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce the spell’s effect (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will partial or Fortitude half), he instead negates the effect.

The virtuoso leaves creeping down dark corridors and matching wits against deadly traps to others. His place is on the stage, surrounded by adoring fans. Fortunately for him, every place he goes becomes a stage, and so long as there’s anyone around for him to impress, he’s in the spotlight. The typical virtuoso is outgoing, charismatic, and gregarious. He loves to be around people and is quick to win friends with his charming manner.

Speak with Dead (Sp):  Starting at 4th level, a vigilante can use speak with dead once per day. His caster level equals his class level.

His caster level equals his class level. Mettle (Ex):  Starting at 9th level, a vigilante’s grim determination allows him to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm him. If a vigilante makes a successful Will or Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce the spell’s effect (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will partial or Fortitude half), he instead negates the effect. An unconcsious or sleeping vigilante does not gain the benefit of mettle.

He adds 2 to his melee attack roll and deals an extra 5 points of damage. Sneak Attack (Ex): Beasley deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

The virtuoso leaves creeping down dark corridors and matching wits against deadly traps to others. His place is on the stage, surrounded by adoring fans. Fortunately for him, every place he goes becomes a stage, and so long as there’s anyone around for him to impress, he’s in the spotlight. The typical virtuoso is outgoing, charismatic, and gregarious. He loves to be around people and is quick to win friends with his charming manner. Some might call him a temperamental egomaniac, yet everyone feels a little better in his presence. Many virtuosos are musicians; others are accomplished dancers or actors. Still others choose to specialize in obscure and unusual forms of entertainment, such as stage magic or juggling. Bards are most often drawn to this prestige class, although multiclass rogue/sorcerers or rogue/clerics can also excel in it. Bards tend to perform as musicians or actors, rogues as either dancers or sleight-of-hand art - ists, sorcerers as stage magicians, and clerics as orators.

Texts and tomes of shadow magic are not easily avail- able, so you must deal with one of the various shadow-magic organizations to begin your search. Given the alien nature of shadow magic, and the fact that you are deliberately attempting to transform yourself into a creature of darkness, few people trust you. In the long-term, the companionship and allies offered by the Votaries of Vecna, the Tenebrous Cabal, or other independent children of night could prove more valuable than any item or riches. Finally, organizations and smaller cadres of children of night often collect ghost touch weapons and force-related magic. These resources allow them to more effectively battle corporeal creatures without manifesting, and to protect themselves from other force effects. CHILDREN OF NIGHT IN THE WORLD “Whatever the so-called ‘children of the night’ practice, it is not shadow magic. The purpose of shadow magic is to control the darkness, and I am not convinced, that between the children and the darkness, it is the children who are in control.” —Eddas Coradran, Lord of the First House, Parliament of Shadows Nothing conveys the alien feel of shadow magic as strongly as the child of night.

You are likely a member of a shadow-related organization, approached and trained by noctumancers who saw potential in your combination of abilities. Alternatively, you might have sought out instructors, having heard of noctumancy. Although such individuals are rare, you might have been a multiclass shadowcaster/arcane caster, discovered the secrets of the noctu- mancer in ancient tomes, and managed to train yourself. Continued advancement requires substan- tial practice and study, equal to if not greater than that required of a shadowcaster or wizard. While you need not (and in fact cannot) learn the most diffi cult spells or mysteries, you possess techniques for combining these very different forms of magic. Once you become a noctumancer, you face the same choices as high-level mystery users and spellcasters, only even more of them. Pay careful attention to the synergy between your spells and mysteries, so that you do not wind up with redundant abilities. Consider mastering the path of Black Magic, because its mysteries complement your class abilities. Raising both Intelligence and Charisma is clearly a wise idea, and feats and items to raise your caster level also prove valuable. RESOURCES Unless another noctumancer belongs to a rival organization, you tend to view him as a kindred soul in an elite society. You frequently trade spells and minor items (potions, scrolls, wands). You’ll likely want staffs, defensive items, and items to boost Intelligence and Charisma—much like any other caster. NOCTUMANCERS IN THE WORLD “My magic is everything I have, everything I am. If someone else can wrest control of my magic from me, what does that make me?” —Hennet, sorcerer and adventurer A noctumancer is the logical extension of abjuration magic, the path of Black Magic, and even the existence of arcane magic in general. It seems only natural that some would devote their efforts to mastering not the use of magic, but the literal control of it. It should appeal to players who enjoy the notion of manipulating the forces that many others take for granted. Eveneth Stillwater, an elf noctumancer 127 Illus. by J.

The shadowblade class allows the DM to introduce shadow Although shadowblades exist in most shadow-related magic into the campaign without excluding the heavy fi ghters organizations, they are not specifi cally associated with such and to grant even the armor-clad warriors in the PC group groups. Many are independent operatives, mercenaries, or some capability at stealth. 130 DAILY LIFE Shadowblades live much like other professional warriors. They practice and train, pursuing their own interests in the few free hours they have. They meditate on their abilities, making them appear more like ascetic or religious warriors (such as paladins) than standard soldiers, although none of their abilities are inherently religious. They fi ll many of the same niches as other fi ghters: guards, soldiers, mercenaries, hired killers, and, of course, adventurers. Shadowblades tend to be nocturnal, due to their growing connection with shadow, and many fi nd themselves shunned in communities that do not understand their abilities. NOTABLES Only a few shadowblades have attained any notoriety, including Niko Drendol, leader of the merciless pirates of the Black Dawn; Jassra Orun, who adventures with multiple companies in her quest to learn more of the Material Plane; and Murrim Khaleed, a death knight in service to the Votaries of Vecna. ORGANIZATION As mentioned above, shadowblades are not associated with any specifi c organization. When they do belong to such, they rarely advance far in the hierarchy, since they lack the mystical abilities that most of these organizations revere. NPC REACTIONS Most common folk think of the shadowblades as a martial order, mistaking them for a united faction or a religious institution. On an individual basis, most people react to shadowblades with the same attitudes they would direct toward any professional soldier. Should a shadowblade make Niko Drendol, a human shadowblade substantial and open use of his shadow-related abilities, this attitude might worsen, as people begin to think of him as a takes a moment for them to reactivate their powers, offering sneak-thief, assassin, or soldier of darkness. They try not to a brief window of opportunity. draw the shadowblade’s ire, but instead do their best to hurry him about his business so that he might depart all the sooner.
