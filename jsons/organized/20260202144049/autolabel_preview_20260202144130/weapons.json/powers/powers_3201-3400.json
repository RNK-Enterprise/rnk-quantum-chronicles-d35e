The antihero enjoys the good life and often rails against injustice. But the antihero usually puts himself before others. He freely acts on feelings of vengeance, and he possesses a different moral code from that of a traditional heroùor no code at all. The antihero kills those that get in his way or threaten him. He has no interest in redeeming wrongdoers and seeks no redemption for himself. Players attracted to playing antihero characters want to do the things that other PCs do, but they imagine their charac- ter having a real dark side. Some enjoy the unpredictability of the antihero: Will he save the kingdom or destroy it? VILLAIN CHARACTERS Some players want to really see what the other side is like. They want to play the characters who instigate the evil plans rather the heroes who react to them. There are two ways to play real villains. 187 APPENDIX 620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd 8/13/02 11:43 AM Page 187 pqs DETECTING EVIL A new character joins the group, and the paladin says ôI detect evil.ö This can completely ruin a playerÆs character concept, or the DMÆs plans to plant a ringer in the group.

Soon, the same depraved addictions and fetishes that a NPC villain places normally considered safe by PCsùnamely, towns might face. Many players feel uncomfortable in campaigns and citiesùare anything but safe. This means that over the like this, obviously. The DM should not use this approach if long term, evil characters must become self-sufficient. They not all the players want it. have to be able to provide their own places to live outside normal, civilized society. They must learn to work outside standard circles, obtain their needed supplies in a different THE EVIL CAMPAIGN way, and gain information through new channels. Even if So how does a DM provide interesting adventures for evil the evil PCs work hard to avoid these implications (using player characters? Is running an evil campaign completely disguises, covering up their evil acts, and so on), the very act different from a normal campaign? of disguising their evil is still a point of departure from a Not really.

The DM can prepare many of the same kinds of adventures for evil characters, but must pay attention to four key differences between an evil campaign and a traditional D\u0026D campaign. As mentioned above, the largest difference is motiva- tion. Clearly, evil PCs are not going to want to help others. The characters do nothing out of the goodness of their hearts, because their hearts have none. The last major difference is interactions. Both with NPCs Greed is the primary motivator for evil PCs. A monetary and in particular with each other, evil characters tend to reward gets a group of evil characters going as quickly as any interact poorly in social situations.

If the characters do terrible things to despicable beings, it might be more palatable to some players. Of CONCLUSION course, the players to whom it makes no difference arenÆt bothered either way. ItÆs been said before, but it bears repeating. This book is not an attempt to glorify evil, but to define it and quantify itùand in so doing to open up new opportu- nities in D\u0026D campaigns of all sorts. Whether the PCs pre- pare for battle against a demon lord or they join ranks with that demon is a decision for the players and DM of each campaign to make for themselves. No matter what that decision is, the material in Book of Vile Darknesswill inject added depth and realism into the adventures that spring from the decision. ItÆs unlikely that any single campaign could make use of all the equipment, feats, prestige classes, spells, magic items, and creatures in this bookùand thatÆs okay. Choose the parts that enhance and contribute to the tone of your campaign, while keeping in mind that the fundamental goal of any D\u0026D campaign is the enjoyment of those who take part in it. 189 APPENDIX 620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd 8/13/02 11:44 AM Page 189 pqs EVIL PCS GETTING ALONG Two evil PCs do not have to come to blows just because they are both evil. Evil characters with similar goals or common foes can certainly work together. And thereÆs no reason to think that evil characters cannot respect something like friendship. Intelligent evil characters realize, just as nonevil characters do, that they can accomplish more by working together rather than working at cross purposes. An evil cleric is better off with an evil fighter companion than alone in the dungeon.

And increase his security he had. . . . A tiny, circular window on the top floor—barely wide enough for a child to pass through—was the weakness of design that ultimately permitted the thief entry. He knelt beneath that very window now, taking a moment to allow his nerves to settle into a relaxation he rarely permitted himself while on the job. His conﬁ  dence came mostly from a pair of sweet sureties: That the worst was behind him, and that he would have plenty of time to search the house at his leisure. (Today was Vendorsday, and he had chosen to break in tonight because he knew Windbag was a creature of habit—one who had a habit of descending into the red light district every Vendorsday night, and just as habitually refusing to return until the wee hours.) As was his custom, Selion paused for a moment, one hand on the pommel of his blade, to allow his eyes to adjust to the low light conditions, and as they did, bade them carefully scrutinize the surroundings. In the dim half-light, shadowy forms began to take shape: an oaken four-post bed with gos-samer canopy; a wide hope chest set against the near wall; a sturdy dresser pressed against the far. He was in the bedroom of a young lady. Judging by the fabrics and the decor, she had probably seen fewer than fourteen winters. He could ﬁ  nd out for sure with but a minute’s search of her belongings, but he had more pressing matters to attend to. The valuables he would doubtless ﬁ  nd in the master bedroom down the hall, for example.  Pushing the dresser’s gently cloying fragrance from his thoughts (could that be lilac?), Selion crossed the breadth of the room in three silent strides and paused again at the door to the hall. Silence. The elf nodded to himself and quietly slipped into the hall, closing the door behind him as he did. He now found himself next to the landing at the top of a lavish staircase that circled the edge of the home’s spacious interior, winding the full two stories down to the first floor. Stepping to the railing, he peered over and took in the scene. From this vantage point, he could see with clarity what would be easy to miss, had he been standing on the ground ﬂ  oor: The central section of ﬂ  oor that was open to the vaulted ceiling was one large, stained glass panel. Although the lighting was poor, he could see that the scene depicted a slavering pack of hounds giving chase to a startled fox across a foggy lea, the silhouettes of several huntsmen in the woods beyond. Selion did a quick accounting of the panel’s value, sighed at the impossibility of his leaving with it, and proceeded down the hall to the master bedroom door, his ﬁ  ngers tracing a path along the railing as he went. What the thief found within gave him further pause. Although the rest of the home was maintained in a manner beﬁ  tting the reputation of a well-to-do antiquities dealer— cleanly, attractively, and with not so much as a single sumptuous PRELUDE 4Prelude: Dead End The cellar door banged open with a hollow crack, and the thief stumbled out into the night. His name was Selion, and most of the time he was considerably more graceful than this. The ﬂ  oor of the alley was slick, wet from an early evening’s rain, and the dampness seeped into the elf’s thin frame almost immediately. He muttered a quick and quiet curse as a practiced kip-up brought him to his padded feet, which took at once to motion, carrying him down the alley and out of sight before the sound of his oath had even faded from the air. Around the corner, he allowed himself the briefest of moments to shake off the chill, and was gone. *     *     * It wasn’t that the thief had been off his game tonight. Selion considered himself a master of his trade, and as such, rarely had what he would consider an off night. Under ordinary circumstances, he could be in and out of even the most secure of structures—taking precisely what he came for, and leaving no evidence of his passing—all in the time it takes to stall a wet horse after a good run. But of course, these were no ordinary circumstances, thanks to that damned Lord Marshal. Ever since the incident with the Lord Marshal’s daughter some months back, matters had grown increasingly more complicated for Selion in this city. Clients who had heard about that event became hesitant to call upon the thief’s services, for fear of drawing unwanted attention from those who sought his head, and even long-standing contacts were beginning to dry up at a pace the elf found disquieting. Clearly, the Lord Marshal was sparing no expense in his effort to catch the “low cur” responsible for his daughter’s condition. As even the lowliest cutpurse can attest, any man in Selion’s position has only three worthwhile options at his disposal: One can skip town, and hope that the reach of those with whom he is unpopular does not extend to his new destination; one can lay very low, and hope the matter blows over with time; or one can stand up to the pressure, and if the gambit pays off, reap a measure of respect from one’s peers. Selion had decided to embrace a combination of the latter two—to hole up with a secret friend while making the occasional foray into the night—and the approach had been largely successful . . . until tonight. The elf had chosen as his mark for the evening’s operation a casual acquaintance of the Lord Marshal’s; an aged windbag who dealt in antiquities and who seemed to be, judging by the state of his home, practically inviting theft. Initial reconnais-sance revealed a thoroughly predictable (and stale) routine, compounded by a handful of so-called security precuations that would be child’s play for any common cutpurse, let alone a master burglar like Selion. Once he was inside, however, it became stressfully clear that someone—the Lord Marshal 620_95386_Ch1.indd   4620_95386_Ch1.indd   4 8/21/06   4:42:13 PM8/21/06   4:42:13 PM5cushion out of place—the master bedroom was an absolute mess by comparison. Clothing, sheets, and what seemed like reams of parchment were strewn haphazardly throughout, making a crinkled and colorful tapestry of the chamber ﬂ  oor. A faint odor wafted into the elf’s nostrils then, and he struggled to recall its source. After failing to unearth it from memory, he pushed it too from his mind and set about his task. His first priority had to be the lockbox he was certain was in this room. When he located his quarry, as he knew he would, the elf snickered aloud. Only a human would have the nerve to hide valuables inside other valuables in such an obvious fashion; in this case, to put a strongbox inside a hinged-top dresser with a three-hundred-year-old lock.  Selion eased his tools into the lock that held the top of the dresser shut, and in a matter of seconds the hinged panel was free. He pushed the top up far enough to see a strongbox resting on a shelf inside, as he had suspected. The lock on the strongbox would surely put up more of a ﬁ  ght, but even modern locks were but a minute’s work for a talent like his. He elected not to move the strongbox from its hiding place, guarding against the presence of a trap that would be triggered if he did so. Instead, he went to work on the lock. As the last of a satisfying series of clicks sounded, the hasp of the lock fell away, allowing the strongbox to be opened. In that instant a silent alarm went off in Selion’s mind, and out of instinct alone, both of his hands jerked back out of the dresser’s top compartment. He almost wasn’t fast enough. A second after that final click, a blade emerged from the bottom edge of the opening in the dresser with a hushed “shing,” and the top of the dresser dropped back down with a concussive rattle, nearly slicing the thief’s hands off in the process. In a series of whispered curses, Selion let out the breath he had been holding while working on the lock. His surprise at having missed the trap, coupled with his growing frustration, caused him to abandon all pretense at subtlety. His intent had been to reclose and relock both the strongbox and the dresser before leaving (true to his calling card as a burglar), but now he just wanted to get what he came for and get out. With a couple of well-placed kicks, he smashed the top of the dresser to splinters. He rid the strongbox of its contents, and after a ﬁ  nal quick sweep through the chamber, left by way of the door through which he had entered. Back out in the hall, he found his escape route had been quickly and silently closed off during his quarrel with the dresser. There, in the hall between the master bedroom and the young lady’s bedchamber, stood three vicious-looking dogs, the eyes of each one fully ﬁ  xed with unshakeable intent upon the intruder before it. The hall now reeked of that familiar odor—the smell of canines. Selion knew he had scant seconds to formulate a plan.",

Blackwall stands atop a high mesa, affording it a commanding view of the surrounding terrain. It is one of the greatest military outposts of the kingdom of Kaddas (see Kaddastrei on page 18). The city was built on the site of what was once a simple village, called Blackwell for its dark waters. After Kaddas chose to construct a military fortification here, the name shifted to Blackwall—a title that confuses outsiders, since the city’s imposing defenses are not particularly dark-colored. Blackwall has a small trading bazaar, but its primary purpose is to watch for invading and monstrous forces. The great city does have a ruling noble—at this time, a duke with blood ties to the king of Kaddas—but his role is largely ceremonial. The true power center is a tribunal of ofﬁ  cers led by the most senior general of Blackwall’s army. The city functions entirely under martial law, with soldiers acting as both police and protectors. ARCHITECTURE Blackwall’s construction emphasizes function over form. The buildings in this military city consist mostly of stone, and the few wooden structures are far away from important ediﬁ  ces or tactically signiﬁ  cant routes. The roofs of major buildings (and even most homes) are built flat to serve as archery platforms or even, in the case of larger structures, bases for heavy projectile weapons. Most such roofs are crenellated to some degree, providing some cover to citizen-soldiers firing on invaders. Buildings have narrow windows—the better for shooting through without making oneself vulnerable—and heavy doors built pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsVIVE LA REVOLUTION! When the moral or ethical outlook of a community differs enough from that of its power center for an extended time, the city is on the verge of revolution. In game terms, the likelihood of unrest depends on the degree of difference between the community alignment and the power center’s alignment. If the two differ by one or more steps on both the moral and ethical axes, the city is in danger of upheaval. An example would be a power center that is neu-tral evil while the community alignment is lawful neutral. A city is also potentially unstable if one alignment component differs by two steps between the power center and the general popu-lation. For example, a populace whose community alignment is chaotic good can tolerate a lawful good power center for only so long, chaﬁ  ng under its restrictions even while sharing its moral outlook.  These are not hard-and-fast rules but rather tools for you as DM to create storylines involving a potential revolt. The nature of this unrest depends on how the populace and its leadership disagree. If the people are law-abiding and good-hearted, but are under the thumb of a ruthless despot, they would likely ﬁ  rst try to remove the offender without destroying the foundation of their system of government. An utterly self-serving populace governed by a group of moral zealots might well bring the whole regime crashing down. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   8620_95386_Ch1.indd   8 8/21/06   4:42:55 PM8/21/06   4:42:55 PM9CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY to withstand battering. Various buildings contain hidden stockpiles of weapons. Citizens know where to go to arm themselves against attack, but invaders will have a devil of a time locating these caches. In certain districts, corner buildings and houses hold large piles of debris on roofs or in alleys, or structures feature extra outer walls that can be easily collapsed. This rubble is ready to be pushed out or toppled over at a moment’s notice, forming barriers against attackers moving through the streets. As might be expected, Blackwall displays less variety in visual styles than other cities of its size. This doesn’t mean that its citizens make no attempt at aesthetics, however. The upper classes practice what is best described as “military chic.” Private homes are built to resemble fortiﬁ  cations, perhaps far more often than they need to be. Wealthy homeowners prefer to decorate primarily in dark hues, with occasional splashes of color depicting various banners and ensigns. Even in those districts where foreigners are relatively common, the styles of other nations are largely absent. Many noncitizens, feeling the weight of suspicious eyes, prefer to blend in rather than draw attention to themselves. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   9620_95386_Ch1.indd   9 8/21/06   4:43:08 PM8/21/06   4:43:08 PM10 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYLAYOUT Military cities typically have wide avenues as their main thoroughfares, but very narrow side streets. This layout forms the optimal combination of offensive and defensive capabilities. Wide main streets enable the city government to move large numbers of troops or cavalry swiftly, but they also permit invading forces to do the same. Narrow crossing streets and alleys serve as ambush points, from which defenders can launch swift guerrilla attacks and then retreat to bolt-holes the enemy cannot reach or ﬁ  nd. Some military cities, especially those built as staging grounds, use a simple circular grid pattern. This layout lets marching troops reach the city gates quickly and easily. Others, including Blackwall, are more concerned with defense. The city streets form a twist- ing web of avenues and alleyways: They turn or even dead-end for no apparent reason, and a given street pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsINTERLUDE: A RESEARCH EFFORT Sometimes PCs have esoteric questions they can’t answer themselves—“What’s the answer to the dragon’s riddle?” “How do we open the Mystic Gates of Shurengaul?” “What are the weaknesses of the demon that nearly killed us?” In short, they need to do research. Fortunately, the city has numer-ous storehouses of information, from the desks of wizened sages to the scrying pools of high priests to the libraries of wizards’ colleges. In game terms, the PCs have to find an NPC sage willing to make a Knowledge check on their behalf. Making such a research effort is a two-step process. First, the PCs must locate someone with the relevant Knowledge skill (often through a Gather Information check, with better results discovering more knowledgeable sages). Then they must pay the price that the sage demands. Make a Knowledge check for the sage as soon as the PCs pose the question they want answered. If the check doesn’t succeed, the sage explains that uncovering the answer will require research (delving into private libraries, consulting with colleagues, and so on) and describes how much time and money such efforts will take. Such research translates into a circumstance bonus: A day spent in research and consultation earns a +2 circumstance bonus, a week increases the bonus to +4, and a month boosts it to +8. Sages charge by the day, so eking out a higher circumstance bonus gets progressively more expensive. To find an appropriate sage, consult the following table. The higher the Gather Information check result, the more sages PCs can locate with appropriate learning in the necessary Knowledge skill. (Sample sages are described after the table.)

Most average between 300 and 600 individuals. Some cities have multiple examples of the same district, but few contain every kind. As a general guideline, small cities have about twenty districts, large cities around forty, and metropolises roughly eighty.  The terms “quarter,” “neighborhood,” “ward,” “end,” and “section” might be used instead of “district.” DISTRICT DESCRIPTIONS The following district descriptions assume a traditional city government ( rule by nobles and royalty ), and a human-dominated culture. You should alter details to ﬁ  t speciﬁ  c circumstances. For instance, the theater and red- light districts are normally considered lower-class areas, but in a city widely known for arts or debauchery, they might be middle- or upper-class destinations. Similarly, a city with a high population of dwarves might have an upper-class dwarf neighborhood, while one dominated by elves might have no speciﬁ  c elf neighborhood at all, but instead a human quarter. Districts are presented in descending order of social class. Each district’s entry includes the following information. Social Class:  Upper, middle, or lower class.

Here, a thousand adventurers meet and a thousand campaigns begin. PCs go to taverns to relax between adventures, to look for new allies (which can be a way for the DM to introduce new PCs), and to set up meetings with NPCs. Sometimes, players just want to roleplay their characters for a while without the ever-present danger of the dungeon.  A tavern interlude should last only as long as everyone at the table is having fun. If some of the players exhibit signs of rest-lessness, it’s time to put away the drinking games, pickpocket-ing, and bar brawls and get on with the adventure. NAMING THE TAVERN DMs are always having to come up with names of taverns on the fly. The accompanying table provides some suggestions using four different naming conventions; you can roll d% or choose from the table below as you like. THINGS TO DO Depending on the tavern, not every activity discussed below will be available (or welcome to the patrons). In upper-class “social clubs,” for example, walking from table to table seeking arm-wrestling matches will get you nothing more than snorts of derision. Getting Drunk: In D\u0026D, social drinking has no adverse conse- quences. Inebriation matters only when PCs are actively trying to achieve that state, perhaps as part of a drinking game. Thus, these rules are intentionally simple (and far kinder than real life). A PC can safely consume a number of drinks per hour (a “drink” counts as a tankard of ale, a glass of wine, or a shot of the hard stuff) equal to one-half his Constitution score. One drink’s effects wear off in an hour. Whenever a character imbibes more than that limit, he must attempt a Constitution check. The DC starts at 15 and increases by 1 per additional drink. PCs with saving throw bonuses against poison (such as dwarves) can apply them to this Constitution check. Each failed Constitution check imposes a cumulative –1 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom (but does not actually reduce those abil-ity scores) and a cumulative –1 penalty on Constitution checks to avoid further inebriation. A character’s effective Dexterity and Wisdom can’t fall below 1 due to inebriation. The character’s actual Constitution score (and hit points) remains unchanged. A charac-ter passes out when the penalty on Constitution checks equals his Constitution score. He remains unconscious for 2d4 hours and is fatigued when he awakens, but the temporary penalties end.  Games: As many bar games exist as bars. Regardless of the game, using magic to influence the outcome is seen as cheating. Games of Skill: In some taverns, a card game known as Three- Dragon Ante is popular. Others use chesslike boardgames to test players’ prowess. To determine the winner of a game of skill, choose the most relevant skill for the main check. For many card games, it’s Bluff. For a boardgame such as chess, Knowledge (history) might be more relevant. Then choose two other skills that matter, but are clearly secondary. Sense Motive, Bluff, and a Knowledge skill are good choices. A character with at least 5 ranks in either of the secondary skills gains a +2 bonus on the main skill check (or +4 if she has 5 ranks in both). Then all participants attempt opposed skill checks.  As an exception to the usual rules, a character can use a Knowl-edge skill untrained if it’s the relevant skill for a game, as long as someone takes the time beforehand to explain the rules to her. d% “Blank and Blank” Creatures Characters People/Place Names 01–10 Thistle and Owl Dragon Rampant Brazen Strumpet Sarlitti’s 11–20 Barrel and River Black Horse Grimacing Ghost Bulwark Corner 21–30 Dragon and Flea Quick Brown Fox Sailor’s Rest Caffeter and Sons 31–40 Smile and Wink Angry Owlbear Black Lord’s Twist Street Tavern 41–50 Axe and Brace Wyvern’s Watch Old Cobbler Eli and Ann’s 51–60 Pony and Saddle Argent Lion Last Dwarf Standing Docksider 61–70 Whistle and Drum Big Fat Toad Tattered Teamster Broken Bridge 71–80 Flotsam and Jetsam Drunken Devil Sly Minstrel Gurrok’s Alehouse 81–90 Chaff and Whey Meek Unicorn Sad Seamstress Sangertaal’s 91–100 Fence and Stile Blue Lammasu Blind Judge Chain Alley Pub 620_95386_Ch1.indd   44620_95386_Ch1.indd   44 8/21/06   4:50:39 PM8/21/06   4:50:39 PM45CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYwinter. Despite the presence of so many city patrols, the impoverished area is plagued by petty crime. Plot Hook:  Several criminals have been positively identiﬁ  ed as those carrying out a recent series of high- proﬁ  le robberies and violent crimes. The problem is, those same criminals are currently languishing in prison cells. Someone is freeing them to commit crimes, or has assumed their forms. Whatever the case, investigating the crimes might require someone to go undercover inside the prison. RED-LIGHT",

Prostitution, illicit substances, gambling, dealers in stolen goods, and crooks-for-hire—all are found here. It is clearly a high-crime area, and nearly everyone is trying very hard to be noticed or not to be noticed, depending on what they’re buying or selling. The city guard patrols the district, but frequent bribes ensure it turns a blind eye to “dubious” goings-on so long as they don’t harm or inconvenience important people. Indeed, the guard makes pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs Feats of Accuracy: Throwing darts is the archetypical tavern game of accuracy. Participants make ranged touch attacks to hit the target; tavern darts are similar enough to weapons that Weapon Focus (dart) and other relevant feats apply. Because a dartboard is designed to reward fine differences in accuracy, have all participants make opposed ranged touch attacks, and award the round to the character who achieved the highest result. Whoever wins five such rounds wins the match. Feats of Strength: An arm-wrestling match is the usual contest of strength in a tavern. Contestants make opposed Strength checks until one wins twice in a row. A contestant who is one size category larger than his opponent earns a +4 bonus on the Strength check. Games of Chance: Some dice and card games are strictly a matter of chance, as are some casino-style games such as rou-lette. You’ve got a pile of dice behind your DM screen, so games of chance should be easy to adjudicate. Drinking Games: Most drinking games are simply tests to see who remains conscious the longest, with all participants drink-ing at the same (frequent) intervals. Resolve such contests with the Getting Drunk rules above. Sometimes other games have a drinking game added, such as a version of darts in which every-one but the winner drinks after each round. Performing: An evening’s work is needed to earn money by singing or playing at a tavern (PH 79)—if you can get the gig. If someone else is already performing at the tavern, then the PC must convince the bandleader or solo performer (initial at-titude indifferent) to let a “guest performer” sit in for a song or two. If the bandleader agrees, the character makes a Perform check. The PC makes no money for this performance but there-after earns a +2 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based checks during that tavern visit if the performance was great (Perform DC 20; PH 79) or better. Picking Pockets: A successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check is sufficient to separate a tavern patron from a coin purse, and a successful DC 25 check can garner a thief some jewelry. The typical taverngoer has a Spot bonus of +1 to notice the theft (as-suming he is not inebriated). Choose either the coins or goods column for a 1st-level treasure on Table 3–5 ( DMG 52);  divide the coin result by 2 to reflect the fact that few people bring significant wealth into bars. A PC who gets caught triggers a hue and cry for the city watch—and maybe a bar fight as well. The victim of a pickpocket notices the missing coins or jewelry 1d4×10 minutes after the theft. Picking a Fight: The tavern brawl is a staple of many D\u0026D adventures—a chance for PCs to fight in a less deadly way.",

If you succeed, the target glowers but doesn’t counter your insult. If you fail, the target responds with an insult directed at you. If you fail by 5 or more, the target throws a punch at you. Bar Brawl: Most bar brawls are simple fistfights, with partici- pants making unarmed strikes that deal nonlethal damage. Most taverngoers don’t bother with grappling, but if you want to use the grappling rules, you can certainly have them do so.  Many bar brawlers resort to weapons of convenience. To keep matters simple, treat a barstool or similar furniture as equiva-lent to a greatclub. A bottle is equivalent to a club until it hits something and breaks; then it’s equivalent to a dagger. A hurled mug (or anything of similar heft) is equivalent to a thrown Small light club (1d4 points of damage). All who use such improvised weapons take a –4 penalty on attack rolls. Escalation: Even bartenders who are sanguine about fisticuffs take matters seriously once swords are drawn. Using a weapon (other than improvised weapons) or damaging magic of any sort produces a call for the city watch, and any NPC not at the heart of the battle flees rather than risk death. The watch arrives at least 1d4 rounds later, although response time varies widely depending on the neighborhood. In general, you can minimize the lethality of a bar brawl by having NPCs fall and stay prone when reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, as well as forgoing attacks on helpless foes and those who clearly don’t want to fight anymore.  Making Friends: Little harm should result from friendly en- counters at the tavern, for PCs that want them. Most tavern patrons have an initial indifferent attitude, although those in the worst dives and the most exclusive social clubs start as un-friendly. PCs can use the Diplomacy skill or enchantment magic to improve NPC attitudes as described on PH 72. Romantic com- panionship requires a friendly attitude (for dancing and casual conversation) or a helpful attitude (for a liaison that extends beyond the visit to the tavern). All sorts of circumstance modifiers can apply to these social in- teractions—including perceived wealth and social class of the PC, number and quality of drinks purchased, and ability to dance. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   45620_95386_Ch1.indd   45 8/21/06   4:50:45 PM8/21/06   4:50:45 PM46 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYa habit of harassing passersby, making visitors almost as wary of the soldiers as they are of local criminals.",

        "description":  "The general rule for hiring an NPC spell- caster is 10 gp × caster level × spell level, plus more if the spell has an expensive material component or an XP cost. Spell casters above 12th level are generally found only in large cities and metropolises, and only the most massive urban centers in your campaign have spellcasters above 15th level. RACES OF THE CITY Some races are more urban than others, yet all can be found within the walls of the greatest cities. City living can have a dramatic effect on the culture, personality, and even racial abilities of those for whom urban life is atypical. HUMANS In most settings, humans are the primary city-builders, since they seem driven by a desire and ability to congregate in communities of substantial size. The vast majority of ruins are also of human make, and most settings assume human builders as the default. With the possible exception of a more cosmopolitan attitude, and perhaps a greater desire for wealth, power, and position, city-dwelling humans differ little from their rural counterparts. DWARVES Dwarves are frequent city-dwellers, but their cities, usu-ally being underground, often have a very different feel from those of their human counterparts. Dwarf cities are frequently less crowded than typical human communities, and even when the population of a dwarf city begins to press against the community’s borders, the multiple levels of an underground dwarf city help to avoid the sorts of packed avenues one often ﬁ  nds in the largest human cities. Those dwarves who adapt to human cities and surface living become, paradoxically, both more and less rigid in their thinking. On one hand, they are exposed to so many different ways of life and daily circumstances that they become more widely accepting of outside traditions and concepts. On the other hand, the daily chaos that is often a part of even the most lawful city causes them to cling to their sense of order. Most urban dwarves are lawful, in even greater percentages than those in other dwarf communities, but they vary between good, neutral, and evil with far greater frequency than normal. While all races have their ambitious members, the majority of urban dwarves either prefer not to seek posi- tions of authority or do so out of a sense of duty rather than any real desire to govern. Most urban dwarves consider the other races inherently disordered and difﬁ  cult to manage. They would rather run their own lives, dealing with others in relatively small and controlled quantities. ELVES Few elves choose urban living, because they are uncomfort- able with being away from nature and in the midst of so many other people and races. Those few who do adapt to city life develop very different attitudes than their tradi-tional cousins. They do not take the long view, as other Table 2–1: Cost of City Services Service Cost Cheap inn 2 sp/nightAverage inn 5 sp/nightFancy inn 2 gp/nightStabling 2 sp/dayRent cheap apartment 1d4 gp/monthRent average apartment or cottage 1d4×10 gp/monthRent villa or manor 2d8×10 gp/monthBuy cheap apartment 1d4×100 gpBuy average apartment or cottage 1d4×1,000 gpBuy villa or manor 2d8×1,000 gpA night of cheap drinking 4 spA night of average drinking 3 gpA night of fancy drinking 30 gpLetter or package delivery 15 spCheap meal (including drinks) 15 cpAverage meal (including drinks) 30 cpFancy meal (including drinks) 1 gpSkill/feat training 50 gp/weekCheap entertainment 5 cpAverage entertainment 3 spFancy entertainment 1 gpCity guide 1 sp/dayGood barrister 1 gp/dayExpert barrister 10 gp/dayForged papers 10 gp–100 gpSpellcasting  10 gp × spell level × caster level, plus material component/XP cost 620_95386_Ch2.indd   51620_95386_Ch2.indd   51 8/22/06   9:13:26 AM8/22/06   9:13:26 AM52 CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURER elves do, because they are too wrapped up in the speed at which their neighbors live their lives. Their curiosity often develops into a desire to accumulate distinctive items and creature comforts. This isn’t to say that all urban elves are greedy—rather, it is simply that they tend to be more like humans in their drive to acquire both the necessities and luxuries of life. Because they do live so much longer than their neighbors, they tend to sway toward one of two extremes, becoming either exceedingly arrogant and domineering or developing a sense of protectiveness and even parental concern for those around them. Other races often object to elves involving themselves in politics, and a few cities even enact laws explicitly forbid- ding or restricting such activities. The elves’ life span allows them to work longer to obtain positions of power, and to hold those positions far longer than anyone else might. This longevity makes politicians of other races nervous. A compromise, uncommon but growing in popularity, is to restrict even supposedly “lifetime” appointments to a set number of years, to ensure that members of longer-lived races don’t come to dominate city affairs. GNOMES Gnomes might not be known for building their own large cities, but they’re certainly at home in those built by others. Known as entertainers and sages, alchemists and inventors, they ﬁ  t right in with a population hungry for distraction, knowledge, and the latest fad. Gnomes rarely hold positions of great importance, but those few who do are driven by the same determination and lust for discovery that inspires the rest of their race. While gnomes generally get along quite well with others, they often have difﬁ  culty getting other races to take them seriously in an urban setting. Their reputations as per-formers and eccentrics, to say nothing of their diminutive stature, often causes humans and others to think of them as amusing but not especially important. Gnomes who seek to advance their position face an uphill struggle, and some become quite ruthless and power-hungry, not out of innate malice, but simply because it is the only way to force rivals and potential allies to acknowledge their abilities. HALF-ELVES If half-elves ﬁ  t in anywhere, it is in the big city. Here they can hope to be accepted based on their abilities and activities rather than their race. A half-elf can become a cog in the gears of society, a valued worker, even a liaison between neighborhoods of humans and urban elves. Half- elves might still face some amount of prejudice, but people in many cities are sufﬁ  ciently cosmopolitan that a typical A human blacksmith pits his skills against a dwarf master craftmakerIllus. by M. Komarck 620_95386_Ch2.indd   52620_95386_Ch2.indd   52 8/22/06   9:13:30 AM8/22/06   9:13:30 AM53CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERhalf-elf with a modicum of perseverance and skill can build a livelihood without suffering under racial bias. Because half-elves usually get along well with both their parent races if given the opportunity, they often ﬁ  nd themselves attracted to positions of power. They are often charming and convincing, traits that in open-minded cities often lead them to occupy such positions. HALF-ORCS While half-elves often ﬁ  nd human cities the most wel- coming environment they can hope for, half-orcs most often receive a cold, even hostile, reception. While half- orcs might ﬁ  nd work as laborers or guards, a great number of civilized folk cannot look at a half-orc without wonder- ing when his wild and barbaric side is going to suddenly reveal itself, sending him into a paroxysm of violent rage. Exceptions certainly exist, such as in cities where half-orcs (or even orcs) are common, but for the most part,the average city dweller looking at a half-orc sees the orc ﬁ rst, and the human (or other) component second—if at all. In most cities, half-orcs do not have two different communities in which they can seek acceptance, as half-elves do. They must make their way among hu-mans (and other races) as best they can and try to prove their trust- worthiness. Half-orcs almost never hold posi- tions of power in most cities, except those with a dominant orc or other monstrous population. No matter how civilized a half-orc seems, too many people cannot get past the race’s appearance and demeanor, and the half-orcs’ penalty to Intelligence and Charisma makes them ill-suited to most governmental positions to begin with. HALFLINGS Given their innate wanderlust and love of pastoral and rural environs, few halﬂ  ings ever settle down to city life. These halﬂ  ings stay because of a growing attachment to some of the local people or because they ﬁ  nd themselves able to make a good living in the city (this explains the prevalence of halﬂ  ing shopkeepers and thieves, com- pared to the general size of the halﬂ  ing city population). Halﬂ  ings in a big city tend to congregate, feeling more at home among their own than amid the vast numbers of the “big folk.” The desire to collect is common among halﬂ  ings, but for many city halﬂ  ings, this attitude often shifts to greed— the need not merely to have, but to have more. Halﬂ  ings who engage in crime or develop a base of political power can be surprisingly ruthless and debased in their desire to acquire the best of everything. Many halﬂ  ings in the city remain friendly and honest, of course, but these in-dividuals rarely develop any real authority, preferring to tend their shops and drink with their neighbors. Be-cause these halﬂ  ings go largely unnoticed beyond their own neighborhoods, it is the acquisitive, merciless ones who often make the biggest impact on a city. Thus, many humans (and others) believe that all urban halﬂ  ings are greedy misers or thieves, and treat them accordingly. MONSTERS IN THEIR MIDST Although such a situation is exceedingly rare, some members of the savage humanoid races have both the urge and the ability to make their homes in human-dominated cities. Goblins, orcs, and even less likely creatures occasion- ally manage to ﬁ  nd refuge and make a living—if they’re willing to obey the laws and to put up with a substantial amount of prej- udice and oppression. The single most impor- tant fact to remember when designing urban-based humanoid characters or neighborhoods is that creatures living civilized lives tend, over time, to become civilized. The orc, bugbear, or even minotaur dwelling in a city might be a rough-cut roustabout at ﬁ  rst. Gradually, however, living by local laws and customs becomes something of an ingrained habit. More important, anyone dwelling in a city long enough eventually develops something worth preserving: friends, a home, employment, a favorite tavern, or what have you. Even if these pleasures seem minor at ﬁ  rst, they eventu- ally become the focus of one’s life. Daily living becomes a  r o u t i n e ,  j u s t  a s  i t  i s  f o r  m o s t  c i t y - d w e l l i n g  h u m a n s ,  and even the wildest humanoid ﬁ  nds himself somewhat civilized despite himself (assuming, of course, that he survives long enough to let it happen).Charask, an urban (and urbane) half-orcIllus. by E. Widermann 620_95386_Ch2.indd   53620_95386_Ch2.indd   53 8/22/06   9:13:35 AM8/22/06   9:13:35 AM54 CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERGoblins Urban goblins tend to remain among the poor and dirty of the city. Uneducated and too small to be effective at physical labor, they usually ﬁ  nd jobs only in menial posi- tions. Th ey are most frequen tly em p loy ed in chimney sweeping, sewer maintenance, pest control, and other areas where their size and lack of personal hygiene are boons rather than detriments. Many urban goblins turn to thievery and murder, making it that much harder for the (very) few law-abiding urban goblins to shake their bad reputation. Most remain bitter, and many that attempt to live in a city wind up leaving and resuming their savage ways, unable to make a viable go of it within the walls. Hobgoblins Hobgoblins are among the few monstrous humanoids frequen tl y ab le to mak e ci ty lif e w ork f or th em. Th eir innate sense of martial order allows them to adapt to city laws more easily than their smaller cousins, and they are intelligent enough to understand customs and procedure. They still face substantial prejudice from others and must work to overcome their own sense of superiority, which would normally prevent them from taking orders from humans or, even worse, dwarves, elves, or gnomes. Hobgoblins can thrive in city life if they can ﬁ  nd work as bodyguards or soldiers, and a rare few manage to obtain ofﬁ cer rank in human militias after many years of loyal service. Few can completely overcome their innate arro- gance, however, and urban hobgoblins are rarely happy unless they have at least a few human underlings whom they can order about. Bugbears These largest of goblinoids ﬁ  nd it extremely difﬁ  cult, though not impossible, to thrive in an urban environment. Their great strength makes them perfectly suited for pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsINTERLUDE: RUNNING A SHOPPING TRIP The main reason PCs come to the city is to buy and sell the spoils of their dangerous trade. As centers of commerce, cities have willing buyers for the rare treasures that PCs extract from dungeons, as well as the high-level artisans and spellcasters required to make the magic items every PC covets. As the DM, you might want to make such shopping a strictly mechanical function, then get back to the adventure as soon as possible. You can simply say, “Sell what you want for half the market price, and buy what you want at the prices listed in the DMG.” Or you can make the shopping trip a mini-adventure in its own right, full of colorful characters and featuring a search across the city to find just the right buyer or seller.  These rules offer a compromise—getting the shopping trip done quickly, but also injecting some of the city’s flavor into the proceedings. First, check the City Economics table to determine the limit on the value of what PCs can buy and sell. Then select some details for the shop and its proprietor by consulting the Sample Shops and Sample Proprietors tables. If you wish, you can add a story twist from the Sample Complications table as well. These tables use dice roll ranges so you can generate a shop-ping trip randomly, but there’s nothing wrong with just picking whatever options you like. Likewise, the suggested class and level of a proprietor are just guidelines; feel free to change them to better fit your city. City Economics City Size GP LimitSmall city 15,000 gpLarge city 40,000 gpMetropolis 100,000 gp Sample Shops d% Shop Details01–20  Cavalcade of Wonders: This shop appears normal from the outside, but the inside has all sorts of harm-less illusions and flashy magic. At the proprietor’s direction, vast animated cabinets trundle forward and open their doors to display wares. d% Shop Details21–40  Dream Emporium: This shop exists beyond traditional walls, in a demiplane of its own. An unassuming door in an alley wall leads to the emporium, which has walls made of cloud. When PCs want to examine something for sale, a hand made of wispy fog emerges from the wall and holds the item forth. 41–60  Vermilion Caravan: Halﬂ  ings or other nomadic people staff this shop—actually a train of wagons, tents set up in a public square, or some other mobile marketplace. Inquiring about an item means talking to several members of the caravan in turn until they’re convinced you’re worth their time. Then you meet the actual proprietor, who quickly makes a deal. 61–75  Arsenal of the Worthy: This shop is built like a military armory, with strong walls and obvious defenses such as portcullises and heavily armed guards. Inside are a series of specialized “quartermasters”—one for weapons, one for armor, and so on. Most of the inven-tory consists of items useful in battle, but the quarter-masters have access to a little bit of everything. 76–90  Eye of the Owl: This disheveled shop has obvious junk falling off every shelf, strewn across the floor, and hanging from the ceiling. But amid the debris are wonders of great value—and only the proprietor can find the right one. This shop is a particularly good choice for PCs intent on buying or selling truly unusual items, rather than just another +1 rapier. 91–100  The Palatine Auction: Rather than a shop proper, this is a perpetually running auction of “antiquities.” Rather than roleplay the entire bidding/counterbid-ding process, you can just stipulate that the winning bid happens to be the listed market price. The pro-prietor might be the auctioneer, or simply a house owner who needs to ascertain whether the PCs are appropriate bidders or sellers. If you want to intro-duce NPCs, making them rival bidders—or purchas-ers of the PCs’ loot—is a good way to attract the players’ attention. 620_95386_Ch2.indd   54620_95386_Ch2.indd   54 8/22/06   9:13:42 AM8/22/06   9:13:42 AM55CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERphysical labor, but they are rarely trusted to do anything else. They are not only the most bestial of goblinoids in appearance, they are also the most chaotic and unpre-dictably violent, and few other races are willing to work alongside them. What’s worse, while the average bugbear is just as smart as the average human, bugbears’ primitive, almost apelike appearance often causes people to assume that they are stupid, and to treat them accordingly. This constant insult—combined with the temper of a martially oriented race that tends toward chaos and evil—leads to bloodshed far more often than not. Many cities do not allow bugbears within their walls for precisely this reason, and even in cities that accept them, bugbears rarely have either the opportunity or the necessary skills or abilities to advance beyond menial labor. All this said, bugbears do better in the city than certain other races, such as orcs. Some of them are wise enough to realize that they must moderate their behavior in order to ﬁ t in, and the rare bugbear who is able to contain his more bestial and barbaric leanings can accomplish a surprising amount. He still isn’t likely to hold a position of ofﬁ  cial authority, but such a bugbear can advance far in military, gladiatorial, criminal, or guild-oriented pursuits.Orcs Although the goblinoid races can sometimes adapt to human society, orcs as a whole are far too bestial and chaotic to do so comfortably. As chaotic as bugbears but not as intelligent, orcs usually ﬁ  nd their way into cities only as slaves or as invaders. Their sensitivity to daylight limits their ability to work as physical laborers, and their bestial nature makes them more trouble than they’re usually worth as slaves. The exceptionally rare orc who deliberately sets out to live within the city has a lifetime of ﬁ  lthy toil and oppression before him; the odds of ever proving himself a viable member of society are small. These urban orcs usually ﬁ  nd themselves in trouble with the authorities, often after a brutal brawl or murder, and wind up either imprisoned or ﬂ  eeing back into the wilds. Kobolds Kobolds suffer from light sensitivity and are ill suited to physical labor, yet they can be found in urban environ-ments more often than orcs. In most cases, however, they make no effort to blend in with society. Rather, a small community of kobolds might make a lair in a run-down neighborhood or section of sewer, and proceed to prey on those nearby just as they might do out in the wild. Clever pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsSample Proprietors d% Proprietor Details 01–20  Blind Kerrulek: This dwarf proprietor (fighter 5/cleric 10) was a master weaponsmith and warchief before he was blinded and cursed in battle with mind flayers. Kerrulek took his disability as a sign from the gods, so he became a cleric of Moradin and started making magic weapons and armor. His grandchildren guide him around the shop and act as his eyes, and he’s always complaining and yelling at them. 21–40  Umerita Glann: A young, bookish gnome, Umerita Glann (wizard 11) takes a scholar’s approach to magic items. She can often discern details about an item’s history from aspects of its design, and sometimes she can even tell something about an item’s creator by identifying its magical aura. 41–60  A Faceless Servant: The owner of the shop—if there is one—remains unseen. All business is conducted with identically hooded servants who rarely speak. If PCs inquire about purchasing an item, the servants bow, depart, and return with the item for inspection. When the PCs are selling, a servant silently inspects the goods, then produces a pile of coins if the sale is acceptable. 61–80  Varria the Crone: Varria (human cleric 13) regards herself as an oracle capable of seeing the future, and she’s fond of offering impromptu fortunes to those who frequent her shop. 81–100  Harloon Traal: Harloon (human wizard 5/cleric 6/mystic theurge 3) was once a traveling adventurer. Because Harloon has a wide array of both arcane and divine spells, his repertoire of merchandise is broad too. Harloon finds magic items endlessly fascinating and is eager to examine (and perhaps purchase) those he’s never seen before.Sample Complications d% Complication01–20  Surveillance: During the transaction, the PCs might notice that they’re under observation, either from a stealthy figure in the shadows or a scrying sensor. The surveillance might continue even after the PCs leave the shop. 21–40  Security: Before they get a chance to do business, the PCs are subject to a number of security procedures, including physical searches and divination spells. 41–60  Acquisition: After the PCs complete their business, the proprietor tells them that a particular sort of item is especially prized and will earn extra coin. The proprietor might even know where such items might be acquired—if the treasure-seekers don’t mind a little danger . . . 61–80  Business Rival: During the transaction, the PCs learn about someone else selling magic items—and it’s clear that the two businesses don’t get along. The proprietor might disparage a rival, or maybe an agent of the rival approaches the PCs shortly before or after the transaction. 81–100  Goods Not as Advertised: The items that the PCs pur-chase have additional “features.” It’s tempting to trick the PCs into buying cursed weapons, but doing so sows a lot of distrust among the players. Instead, think about extra, unadvertised functions, such as a weapon that’s sentient or that has a power activated under rare conditions. Perhaps the proprietor didn’t know about the extra function, or maybe there was another reason for remaining silent. 620_95386_Ch2.indd   55620_95386_Ch2.indd   55 8/22/06   9:13:46 AM8/22/06   9:13:46 AM56 CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERand sneaky as they are, kobolds can often do this for years without anyone realizing that the perpetrators of the local crimes are anything other than a gang of human criminals. Several kobold tribes have even become leaders of citywide thieves guilds in this fashion, slowly building up wealth, power, and inﬂ  uence in the underworld. Kobolds who attempt to actually live a normal, human-style life in a city are so astoundingly rare that few generalities can be drawn about them, except that they have at least as difﬁ  cult a time ﬁ nding acceptance as goblins do. Lizardfolk If the other monstrous races often fail to ﬁ  t into city life because of how they behave, lizardfolk often remain outsiders because of how they think. Lizardfolk only barely grasp the concept of cities, not because they are stupid—they are, on average, only slightly less intelligent than humans—but because it’s a completely foreign idea to their reptilian minds. Lizardfolk are guided purely by survival instinct, and while they band together in tribes to increase the likelihood of survival and success, the notion of living in harmony with creatures that do not directly contribute to that survival is almost inconceivable. F ew of th em w an t t o li v e in ci ti es, an d th ose w h o mak e th e attempt almost invariably wind up either in trouble with the authorities or facing a large number of enemies in the community simply because the lizardfolk in question considers what’s good for him ﬁ  rst, and the laws of the society second (if at all). Combine these attitudes with their preference for marshy or semiaquatic environments, neither of which are particularly good for city building, and the result is a race that is simply ill-suited for urban life. The very rare exception is truly an anomaly among his own kind—a lizardfolk with attitudes and ideas totally alien not only to the culture, but to the actual psychology and physiology of the race into which he was born. And of course, given their difﬁ  culty in understanding and adhering to civilized strictures, even these rare lizardfolk might be able to survive in the urban landscape, but they almost never advance particularly high within it. Other Races Monstrous races other than those discussed above do, on very rare occasions, manage to make their homes in cities. Minotaurs make terrifying guards or soldiers, and their inability to get lost makes them excellent guides. Dop-pelgangers who are uninterested in inﬁ  ltrating the upper echelons of politics might ﬁ  nd work as performers, detec- tives, con artists, or even prostitutes. Ogres and other giants can work at heavy construction when they are not being used on the battleﬁ  eld. Gargoyles are excellent sentries, practically unnoticed amid the city’s statuary, and pixies and dryads are fantastic groundskeepers. None of these arrangements are especially common, and any “monster” that seeks to make its Some savage humanoids can become civilized; others ﬁ  nd their own place in the cityIllus. by E.

For the few that wish to try, however, and the even fewer that have the fortitude to pull it off, a truly cosmopolitan metropolis might one day permit them to call it “home.” CONTACTS A contact is an NPC friendly to, or sympathetic toward, one of the PCs, someone to whom that PC frequently turns for aid, information, or companionship. Contacts occupy something of a gray area in the “scheme” of NPCs. Those who join with the group more properly qualify as cohorts (as per the Leadership feat); those paid to assist are hirelings. An NPC who plays a major role in a story or adventure needs no mechanical system to deﬁ  ne her impact. The contact, then, is someone with whom the PCs deal frequently, and with whom they exchange favors and intelligence, but is not necessarily a vital part of what’s happening around the group. While the line might seem ﬁ  ne, it is an important dis- tinction to make. DMs should never feel obligated to make important NPCs—even frequent allies—into contacts. It would be silly for the DM to say, “Gee, Sergeant Rolstoff really admires the PCs, and he’s grateful that they saved his son’s life back when those hags tried to take over the gnome district, but nobody in the group has any slots left for contacts, so I guess he’s not going to help them.” In short, think of contacts as those allies whom the PCs make an effort to seek out, or those with whom they begin the game, rather than friends made through the standard course of events. Only if the PCs wish to gain more from an NPC than simple friendship should the DM consider treating him as a contact. USES FOR CONTACTS A contact’s behavior toward a PC falls somewhere between that of a cohort and a hireling. The contact won’t risk his life for the PC or accompany him on adventures, but he can provide information, inﬂ  uence other individuals or groups on the PC’s behalf, or make a skill check as long as doing so doesn’t cost money. (If money is involved with the check, the PC must pay the expenses.) In addition, a contact might occasionally waive his normal fee for a service performed for the character, but only rarely and at speciﬁ  c intervals. Table 2–2: Sample City Contacts provides a few examples of contacts, the sorts of favors they might perform, and the intervals at which they might perform them. Sample contacts for speciﬁ  c types of organizations, guilds, and priesthoods, can be found in those appropriate sections. At the DM’s discretion, a contact might expect the relationship to work both ways, occasionally coming to the PC for favors of a similar magnitude. This can be an excellent plot hook, or at least provide a small break from an ongoing adventure. GAINING CONTACTS In an urban campaign, the DM might allow the PCs to begin with one contact each at character creation, unless the concept of the campaign indicates otherwise. Beyond these potential starting contacts, however, a PC wishing to gain a contact must ﬁ  rst ﬁ  nd and select an NPC. If this individual’s attitude toward the character is worse than helpful, the PC must adjust his attitude to helpful either with a successful Diplomacy check, or through roleplaying various favors done for the NPC. Once the NPC’s attitude is helpful, the p l a y e r  n e e d  o n l y  d e c l a r e  t h a t  h e  w i s h e s  t o  c o n t i n u e  h i s  character’s relationship with the NPC as a contact. In most campaigns, a PC can have a number of contacts equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1). In particularly social or political campaigns, the DM might consider increasing this number by up to three. Additionally , a character who joins a guild, organization, or priesthood, or who gains the patronage of a noble house, gains one extra contact that does not count against his Charisma-based maximum. If a PC loses a contact—perhaps through the NPC’s death, or because the relationship deteriorated—the character does not automatically gain a replacement. Simi- larly, an increase in the character’s Charisma modiﬁ  er does not automatically grant a new contact. The PC must seek out additional contacts, just as he did the original ones.

In some cities, these divisions are far more complex, with such distinctions as lower middle class and upper middle class. In others, the middle class does not exist at all; everyone who is not rich and powerful is destitute. Select cultures formalize these divisions into strict castes, perhaps declaring the poorest of the poor “unclean” or “untouchable.” In such societies, you can never earn your way into a higher status; the caste you are born into is the one in which you will die. In most regions, however, social class is an informal, and sometimes even unrecognized, demarcation. If a poor person becomes successful enough, he can often move up in class. It takes far more than just wealth to become a noble, but the nobility does not make up the entirety of the upper class, at least in most cultures. This section provides general deﬁ  nitions and a list of sample members for each social class. These examples refer only to the average members of the given profes-sions; a particularly successful farmer might rise above the lower class, while a the master of a major guild might, if his guild is particularly poor or out of favor, belong to the middle class.",

        "description":  "Middle-class citizens live comfortably, if not richly. They boast a small amount of discretionary income. They aren’t capable of purchasing extravagant luxuries, but they do not live a hand-to-mouth existence, and might spend some time drinking and dining with friends, or might buy the occasional bauble or fancy outﬁ  t. Most live in apartments—either in a nice building or above their own store or workshop—or in a comfortable home. They have a wide range of incomes, and their lifestyles range from poor to the lower end of common ( DMG  130). Although the income gap between the lower and middle classes is smaller than that between middle and upper, it is far more common for a middle-class citizen to rise to the upper classes than for a poor person to rise to middle class. This is true because the impoverished have no opportunity to save up or invest in opportunities that might make them wealthier, and because the nobility sometimes allows merchant families to marry into its ranks. Members of the middle class include artisans, butlers, craftsmen, merchants, military ofﬁ  cers, minor guild-masters, petty or landless nobles, priests, and successful shopkeepers and innkeepers. The Upper Class: These citizens are society’s most rich and powerful, its true movers and shakers. Some are born into noble families, others inherit fortunes from powerful parents, while a very select few work their way up from the lower echelons through sweat and blood. In many areas, the “newly rich” are never as well respected as those born into the upper class, but they are still treated with far more respect than the other social classes are. Upper-class citizens often have sufﬁ  cient income for lavish lifestyles, personal servants, large houses, and many hobbies and luxuries. They live lifestyles ranging from the upper end of common, through good, and into extravagant ( DMG  130). Many earn more in a week or even a day than the poor see in years. Members of the upper class include ambassadors, city aldermen, high priests, knights, magic-item vendors, magistrates, major guild-masters, military generals, nobles, powerful merchants, powerful spellcasters-for-hire, respected sages, royalty, and successful high-level adventurers. URBAN FEATS This section introduces a host of new feats for use in urban campaigns. For more city-appropriate feats, see Races of Destiny . CITY MAGIC [METAMAGIC] You can use the city itself to shape and enhance your spellcasting. Prerequisite:  Caster level 3rd. Beneﬁ  t: You can modify any damaging spell you cast to incorporate the urban environment. When casting an offensive spell with an energy subtype—acid, cold, electricity, ﬁ  re, or sonic—you can invest the spell with a portion of the city’s spirit. In most cases, this investment is gritty and spectacular, drawing dirt, gravel, nails, and pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsVARIANT: SOCIAL CLASSES FOR ADVENTURERS AND CAREER SKILLS For the most part, social class has little impact on character creation or abilities. Choosing your social class is like everything else in a character’s background; it might come into play in her backstory, and it should certainly impact the way the character acts, but it has no mechanical effect. Some people, however, feel that a character’s upbringing should impact her abilities, at least to a minor extent. Similarly, many people think that a character—particularly in an urban environment—should have some abilities to represent her life and training from before she became an adventurer. After all, few people grow up planning to become adventurers; they are caught up in events bigger than they, or find no other means of achieving their goals, or simply see mundane life as too boring. Still, they had a life and education prior to picking up sword or spellbook, and might even have a career on which they fall back when no monster threatens and treasure is scarce. To that end, consider the following optional rule. Each char-acter is permitted to select three skills from a list determined by her social class. These skills represent a period of training, a career, or a hobby that is not directly linked to her life as an ad-venturer. They become permanent class skills for the character; that is, no matter what classes she advances in, these are always considered class skills. If she chooses a skill that is a class skill for her current class, she also gains a +1 competence bonus on those skill checks. (She can only gain this bonus once per skill, even if it appears on more than one of her classes’ skill lists.) None of these advantages should particularly unbalance a character when compared to those created without this optional system. Nevertheless, if a campaign involves both urban and nonurban characters, the Dungeon Master is encouraged to either refrain from using this variant, or to allow its benefits even to nonurban characters. Characters from nonurban areas are usually considered to be lower-class citizens. Lower-Class Skills: Craft, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Knowledge (local), Profession. Middle-Class Skills: Appraise, Craft, Profession, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty). Upper-Class Skills: Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), Knowl- edge (nobility and royalty), Ride, Speak Language. RANDOM DETERMINA TION When using this variant, some people might prefer the oppor-tunity to determine their character’s social class randomly, just as they can height, weight, and age. If so, simply roll percentile dice after determining your base stats. On a roll of 01–60, you are lower class; 61–90, middle class; and 91–100, upper class. 620_95386_Ch2.indd   59620_95386_Ch2.indd   59 8/22/06   9:14:02 AM8/22/06   9:14:02 AM60 CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURER other nearby detritus into the spell effect. In other cases, the investiture is much more subtle, often merely chang- ing the look of the spell. Only half the damage from a spell with the appropriate subtype is considered energy damage, and is thus subject to resistances or immuni-ties. The remainder comes from the city itself, and is not subject to spell or energy resistances or immunities. This investiture only occurs for spells cast within urban environments, deﬁ  ned as any area above the size of a small town ( DMG 137). For example, a wizard uses City Magic to cast a ﬁ  reball at a creature with resistance to ﬁ  re 15. The damage roll is 20, half of it ﬁ  re damage and half “city.” Thus, the target takes 10 points of “city” damage instead of 5 points of ﬁ  re damage. This feat is useless to spellcasters who cast their spells in a nonurban environment as deﬁ  ned above. A spell modiﬁ  ed using the City Magic feat uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level. DECEPTIVE SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can cast spells that seem to come from somewhere other than where they should. Beneﬁ  t: A deceptive spell appears to come from any direction you choose. For instance, a magic missile might shoot from a nearby doorway, rather than from your own ﬁ nger, or a lightning bolt  might emerge from the ﬂ  oor rather than from you. You cannot use this feat to gain a bonus to hit, to circumvent cover, to ﬂ  ank, or in any other way to gain a numeric or mechanical advantage on any attack rolls. Its purpose is to disguise the source of the spell, preventing anyone who did not actively observe you casting it from recognizing you as its caster. You cannot apply Deceptive Spell to any spell with a range of touch or a target of you. A deceptive spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level. EFFICIENT DEFENDER You have learned to use new techniques and modiﬁ  ca- tions to your armor to increase its protective ability. Prerequisite:  Heavy armor proﬁ  ciency. Beneﬁ  t: When you wear light or medium armor, you gain 1 more point of armor bonus to your AC than that armor normally provides. For example, a suit of studded leather would have a +4 armor bonus rather than 3. How- ever, because you must adjust and customize the armor to more effectively cover weak spots, it is also slightly more encumbering, increasing its armor check penalty by 1. You are not required to make use of this feat. You decide when donning the armor whether you wish to don it normally, or with this feat in effect. Special:  A fighter can select this feat as one of his bonus feats.Thanks to the Deceptive Spell feat, they’ll never know what hit themIllus. by H.

        "description":  "If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you fell. If you succeed on a Jump check when jumping down ( PH 77), you take falling damage as if you had dropped 20 fewer feet than you actually did. Master of the Roof:  You know how to use the slopes to your advantage. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against any opponent who is at a different elevation from you.SCULPT SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can alter the area of your spells. Prerequisite:  Any metamagic feat. Beneﬁ  t: You can modify an area spell by changing the area’s shape to either a cylinder ( 10-foot radius, 30 feet high), a 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, a ball (20-foot-radius spread), or a 120-foot line. A sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but affects a 20-foot-radius spread. A sculpted spell uses a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level. SPECIAL DISPENSATION You have been given leave to carry even banned armor, weapons, and equipment in a given area. Prerequisite:  Favored. Beneﬁ  t: Due in part to your standing within your organization, you have received special dispensation from the authorities to wear or carry whatever equipment you deem necessary, regardless of local armor and weapons laws. This feat is often represented in the game, either by an object of some kind—typically an ofﬁ  cial government seal—or even a mark, such as a tattoo. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsSample Healers d% Details 01–20  Justanian the Pious: PCs who seek healing get a dose of Justanian’s doctrine along with each beneficial spell. Justanian (human cleric 9) makes it clear that he’s not selling his spells—the PCs are “voluntarily tithing” to his faith, and he is rewarding the pious. (An arbitrary distinction, perhaps, but it matters to Justanian.) 21–40  Elerick Whitehaven: Elerick (human cleric 15) has lived and worshiped in the city for nearly a century, and he’s seen almost everything in that time. As he nears the end of his life, he’s less concerned with the speciﬁ  c doctrines of his faith and more with his overall legacy. He looks every bit the stern, aged high priest, but he’s quite practical and willing to listen to notions others might ﬁ  nd heretical. 41–60  Glannara of the Glowing Hand: Glannara (elf cleric 13) is a recent arrival, and the PCs might know more about the city’s inner workings than she does. An idealistic priest of her religion, she acts quickly to aid others, then seeks assurance that she did the right thing. 61–80  Andruscal Thorne: Andruscal (half-orc cleric 10) gave up a life of marauding and banditry when he converted to the faith several years ago. He’s a cheerful proselytizer, gently trying to win the PCs over to his church, no matter who they are. He’s not pushy, but he often says things like, “Have you thought about Fharlanghn?” (or whatever deity he worships). 81–100  Ma’aneth of the Scars: A wandering minstrel who undertook many adventures before settling in the city, Ma’aneth (human bard 10) insists that those who want her magic first tell her about their recent adventures—providing possible inspiration for her music.Sample Extenuating Circumstances d% Details01–20  Quest Available: The PCs can earn a discount (typically 50%) on the cost of healing if they agree to perform a quest on behalf of the healer. The quest is usually something that can be accomplished in a few days, although you can use it as the launching point for a major adventure. 21–40  Prophetic Assistance: The healer has been forewarned to give the PCs healing magic at a discount (or even free) in an oracular dream, or by a divination  spell or similar magic. 41–60  Sectarian Favorite: If the PCs can demonstrate that they’re living the creed of the healer, they can earn a discount (typically 25%). 61–80  Your Reputation Precedes You: The PCs are known as people who can get things done, and the healer’s sect would like them to regard it favorably. The healer offers a discount (typically 25%) on the cost of spellcasting and speaks vaguely of seeking “worthy allies in the coming times of darkness.” 81–100  For Services Rendered: The PCs’ recent adventures have directly or indirectly aided the church’s efforts, and the healer offers a discount (or even free healing) as a way of thanking them. 620_95386_Ch2.indd   63620_95386_Ch2.indd   63 8/22/06   9:14:19 AM8/22/06   9:14:19 AM64 CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN",

You can detect the presence of weap- ons in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. A “weapon” is generally deﬁ  ned as any manufactured weapon. The spell detects improvised weapons such as bottles or pitchforks only if the wielder actively  intends to use such an item as a weapon. The amount of information revealed by this spell depends on how long you search a particular area. 1st Round:  Presence or absence of weapons. 2nd Round:  Number of weapons in the area. 3rd Round:  Specific locations of the weapons and the type of damage they deal (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). This spell does not reveal if weap-ons are magical, or anything else about them. Weapons hidden by secret weapon , or borne by individuals who are under the effect of a non- detection  spell, do not register. Each round, you can turn to detect weapons in a new area.

This indi-vidual might be yourself, or anyone else present at the time of casting. Once this individual draws the weapon, the false peacebond effect ends; resheathing the weapon does not reactivate the spell. IMPEDING STONES",

The purpose of the meeting might be negotiation, exchange of goods or information, or receiving instructions from a shadowy organization. Given time to prepare, you can create all sorts of tension-filled encounters with mysterious strangers in the city. But sometimes the players can surprise you: “Let’s contact the thieves guild and see if they’ll pay for this information.” In such a situation, use this interlude to set up the encounter quickly and give it the flavor of your city. Start by choosing a location and the stranger’s protection, using the tables below, and select a complication if you wish. You also need to know something about the mysterious stranger, of course, but the ongoing narrative should guide you there. You can generate an encounter randomly if you wish by roll-ing d% and consulting the tables below, or you can just pick whatever options you like. The sample protections are just sug-gestions; feel free to adapt them to your city. Sample Locations d% Details01–20  Landmark: The mysterious stranger wants to meet the PCs at a public fountain, a monument to a war hero, on the steps of city hall, or in some other place known to every city resident. 21–40  Alley: The PCs get directions to an alley, a dead- end street, or some other secluded location that’s near the hustle and bustle of the city but out of direct view. 41–60  Tavern: The mysterious stranger provides a meeting time and the address of a tavern, plus some other direction, such as “Sit at the table in the back on the left,” “Look for an old woman in a green cloak,” or “Order a bottle of red wine, but don’t uncork it.” (See the Trip to the Tavern interlude on page 44 for instructions on quickly generating a tavern.) 61–80  Crowded Place: A marketplace, a city gate, or the intersection of two busy streets is an easy place for people to converse without attracting attention. As with the tavern description above, the stranger provides some sort of direction so the PCs can contact the right person. 81–100  Quiet Place: The stranger awaits the PCs in the rear scroll room of the Grand Library, in the catacombs underneath the temple, or in some other out-of-the-way place where few people go. Getting to the location can be as much of a challenge as the meeting itself. Sample Protection d% Details01–20  Obvious Bodyguards: The mysterious stranger has four bodyguards (fighters four levels below the PCs’ average level) who are standing in plain view, weapons at the ready and eyes alert. The guards remain a discreet distance away during the meeting, but they don’t let their ward out of their sight.  d% Details21–40  Hidden Bodyguards: As above, but the bodyguards are rogues and either hidden (if not many other people are around) or disguised (if the meeting is in a public place). 41–60  Magical Getaway: The stranger has a way to escape if the meeting turns dangerous, such as a potion of ﬂ y ,  a scroll of teleport , or a spell or spell-like ability with a similar effect. The escape mechanism must be usable at a moment’s notice. PCs might notice the stranger palming a small vial, rubbing a fancy ring, or ﬁ  dgeting with a bit of gum arabic (a material component for invisibility ). 61–80  Summoned Assistance: The mysterious stranger can bring help from elsewhere, either through mundane means (such as yelling, “Get ‘em, boys!”) or magical techniques (such as calling an outsider to act as guardian or sending a message  spell to colleagues out of sight but in the vicinity). 81–100  Turns the City against You: If the meeting goes awry or ends badly, the mysterious stranger resorts to using the city’s denizens against the PCs. The stranger might cry out for the watch, claiming that the PCs just committed a crime. Or the PCs could be branded as agents of a hostile power, members of a feared cult, or monsters such as lycanthropes that masquerade as ordinary folk. Sample Complications d% Details01–20  PCs’ Rivals Ambush: The PCs have earned the enmity of some organization, and it chooses the time and place of the meeting to exact revenge on them. The PCs must simultaneously deal with their enemies and keep the mysterious stranger from bolting or misinterpreting the attack. 21–40  Stranger’s Rivals Ambush: As above, but it’s the enemies of the mysterious stranger that spring the ambush. The PCs might ﬁ  nd common cause with the stranger, or they might get caught up in a ﬁ  ght that doesn’t involve them. 41–60  Eavesdroppers: Rivals of the PCs or the stranger use mundane or magical means to observe the meeting. Their methods can range from a hidden, disguised, or invisible  agent nearby to a clairaudience or scrying spell. 61–80  Test Them First: The mysterious stranger insists that the PCs engage in some activity before the meeting takes place. Perhaps the PCs have to disguise themselves, or they need to contact an elaborate sequence of intermediaries, each of whom expects to hear the correct password. Maybe the stranger appears only if the PCs ﬁ  rst defeat a rival or perform some other dangerous task. 81–100  Mysterious Impostor: The person the PCs were supposed to meet has been replaced by an impostor (perhaps by enemies of the PCs or of the mysterious stranger). If the PCs know what the stranger looks like, then the impostor must use illusion magic or the Disguise skill—or maybe the impostor is a doppelganger. But if the PCs don’t know whom they’re meeting, then the impostor need only behave convincingly. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   73620_95386_Ch3.indd   73 8/22/06   9:19:16 AM8/22/06   9:19:16 AM74 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERConstable No matter how many precincts or guards a city boasts, there’s usually a single ﬁ  gure at whom the martial buck stops. This ﬁ  gure, the constable, is to the executive arena what the justice is to the judicial. In smaller towns, where there is little need for multiple layers of law enforcement, this ofﬁ  cial is often known as the sheriff. In larger cities, he or she is akin to a chief of police, commanding multiple sheriffs who each report from a different district. The constable enforces the city’s laws and, should the government declare martial law, takes charge of its local army. Alternate Title:  Sheriff.",

CITY SERVICES Some organizations that are technically part of the city government do not qualify as political bodies unto them- selves. What follows is a sampling of the most common sorts of civic services. As in the previous section, each discussion includes a sample contact upon whom the PCs can call for favors. Corpse Collection In most cities, the less than pleasant duty of dispos-ing of the dead is left to a special branch of the city government, typically known as the Corpse Collection Department. In times of plague, collectors are among the busiest civil servants in town. Sample Contact: Willis T eegle ( commoner 2/ expert 1 ). For a modest sum (50 gp), Willis will make sure any single 620_95386_Ch3.indd   74620_95386_Ch3.indd   74 8/22/06   9:19:20 AM8/22/06   9:19:20 AM75CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERbod y is cremated bef ore being examined, so long as it won’t be missed. Once only (though a more lucrative fee might encourage him to repeat the favor). Maintenance One of the most basic city services is the maintenance of public areas, including government buildings, roads, parks, and street lamps. In cities with no sewage system to dispose of waste, this ex- tra (foul) duty also falls on the shoulders of mainte-nance workers. Sample Contact: Stan- zon Grum (commoner 7). For a bribe of 5 gp or more, Stanzon will collect all the garbage found on the prop- erty of any politically unimportant ﬁ  gure and bring it to the PCs, with no questions asked. Once per month. The Watch Every urban center has a militia of this vari- ety, whether it’s called the guard, the police, or any num- ber of similar names. The watch is the city’s ﬁ  rst level of law en- forcement; depending on a city’s morality and resources, its members can range from thugs with badges to well-trained and highly ethical warriors. Sample Contact: Ofﬁ  cer Foxleigh (commoner 1/warrior 2). For a small consideration (3 gp), Foxleigh will share information about ongoing investigations to which he is privy, pro-vided it doesn’t come back to harm him or the watch. Twice per month. Houses A house is an extended family bloodline; members can often track their ancestry back many generations. It includes all legitimately born members of the family— some houses recognize bastards as well, but this stance is far from universal—unless some family members have been deliberately cast out for serious transgressions. Usually, one can join a house only through adoption or marriage. Someone outside the family might become a servant or employee of the house—or even be favored as m u ch as so m e tru e m e m be rs—b u t h e will n e v e r  truly belong. Houses carry the primary name of the family; for instance, House Ebonmar is the house representing t h e  f a m i l y  t r e e  o f  D u k e  B a l t h u s  E b o n m a r .  S i n c e  people can join the house through marriage and pass their own names along to their children, not every member of a house shares the family name. For example, if Duke Balthus’s sister marries a man named Randas Arran, his last name does not change; he simply becomes “Randas Arran of House Ebonmar.” Most houses in a fantasy setting represent noble families. Because de- scent and purity of the blood are of vital social importance to most no- ble lines, they track their lineage with extreme care. The larg- er the noble house, the more power it likely has in the local government. If House Ebonmar is the largest noble house in the kin g d o m , i t p ro ba b l y h as m o r e governmental positions than any other house, and thus it might be able to put pres-sure on the king or other n o b l e s  t o  m a k e  d e c i s i o n s i n  i t s  f a v o r .  I n  m o s t  c a s - es, no single house utterly dominates a kingdom or city, except perhaps the royal house from which the king descends. The political wrangling between houses can be fierce, especially in circumstances where the line of as-cension to the throne is not clear. In most cases, this conﬂ  ict is limited to under-the-table deals, payoffs, favor-trading, blackmail, and other political maneuvers. On occasion, however, it can escalate into physical intimidation, kidnapping, assassination, and even civil war.  The leader of a house is usually its oldest living member. In some cultures where gender is an issue, the leader might need to be male, or female, depend- ing on the particulars. If a younger member of a house holds an especially important position in society, he might also serve as house leader, but this situation is rare. A very few houses elect a leader from among their ranks, rather than declaring someone to be the newest ascender to the position. Many noble houses are known for their skills or abili- ties at speciﬁ  c tasks. One house might produce famous warriors, while another might have a long history Dealing with politics in the city can be just as dangerous as adventuring in the deepest dungeonIllus. by J. Hodgson 620_95386_Ch3.indd   75620_95386_Ch3.indd   75 8/22/06   9:19:24 AM8/22/06   9:19:24 AM76 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERof artistry or craftsmanship in a particular medium, while a third might breed the best horses and train the best riders. Such an ability is usually secondary to a house’s political ambitions, but savvy house leaders build on their strengths (such as ensuring that the bulk of military officers in a region belong to their own bloodline). A rarer but growing phenomenon is that of the mer-chant house, formed not of noble bloodlines but from families whose members have gained enough economic and mercantile inﬂ  uence to be powers in their own right. They often sit at the heart of merchant guilds or similar organizations. Many can shape the ﬁ  nances of entire markets by setting prices, intimidating rivals, and threatening to cut off the ﬂ  ow of certain goods. A few are powerful enough to inﬂ  uence governments or noble houses. Most merchant houses have inﬂ  uence over one or two kinds of commerce—such as textiles or shipping—but the largest might inﬂ  uence all markets in a given region. They, too, are normally led by their oldest living member. Members of a house always belong to the upper class, whether the house is of the noble or the merchant vari- ety. Houses are primarily found in cities where humans or elves predominate. Gnomes rarely trace their family lineage back far enough to create houses, while dwarves and halﬂ  ings live in communities made up exclusively of blood relatives. Still, members of those last three races who have dwelt in a human city or an elf city for more than a generation or so might find themselves caught up in politics and could eventually be adopted into a house. PLAYER CHARACTERS AS HOUSE MEMBERS Upper-class PCs might belong to a local noble or mer- chant house, either through blood or marriage. In such cases, consider allowing them an extra contact before the start of play. Such a contact must be a member of the house to which the character belongs. Similarly, a PC who becomes a member of a house during play—unlikely, but not impossible, through marriage or adoption as a reward for service—immediately gains one house-based contact. HOUSE PATRONAGE Far more likely for PCs than joining a house is receiving the patronage of one. Noble and merchant houses offer ﬁ nancial and political assistance to individuals—normally artisans, but sometimes researchers or adventurers—whom they wish to see succeed. For instance, a house interested in ﬁ  ne art might pay a particularly talented artist, so she can develop her work without having to worry about earning a living. Of course, the house expects something in return for its patronage, which can serve as a fulcrum for numerous stories and adventures during the campaign. GAINING PATRONAGE If a character has grown famous for her accomplishments or activities, a house might offer her patronage. If the character’s activities beneﬁ  t that house directly—whether or not she intends them to—then the likelihood of such an offer increases signiﬁ  cantly. More proactive characters might actively seek out the patronage of a noble or mercantile house. Start by deciding what skill the PC wishes to offer the house. (Most PCs will likely approach a house as adventurers, but one with high skill ranks might attempt to gain patronage as an artist or performer.) To determine which house is most likely to offer patronage to someone with her skills, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Knowledge (nobil- ity and royalty) check or a DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (history) check. Once the character has chosen which house to approach, she must arrange a meeting with someone of standing within it; the precise details depend on the city and the political situation, but doing so likely requires at least a DC 15 Diplomacy check. Several days might pass before even a low-ranking house noble can meet with the character. Once she finally obtains her meeting, she must convince the individual that her services are worth supporting. If she seeks patron-age for a craft, she must produce a sample product or performance of masterwork quality or its equivalent. (In other words, she must succeed on a DC 20 check using the appropriate skill.) If she is instead selling her services as an adventurer or the like, she must suc- ceed on a DC 20 Bluff or Diplomacy check to convince the individual that her deeds are of sufficient merit. If the PC has already performed great deeds of note, reduce the check DC by 5 or even 10. If the individual becomes convinced, the PC has gained the patronage of the house. Certain houses might have other requirements as well, such as offering patronage only to individuals of a particular race, profession, social status, or the like. The DM should determine such requirements as he sees fit, based on the persona and nature of  the house. BENEFITS OF PATRONAGE House patronage grants a character several valuable advantages. First, the house pays for the PC’s room and board, up to that allowed by a common lifestyle ( DMG  130). 620_95386_Ch3.indd   76620_95386_Ch3.indd   76 8/22/06   9:19:30 AM8/22/06   9:19:30 AM77CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERThis outlay is not actually paid to the character, and thus it cannot be used for anything other than living expenses. Second, the character gains one free contact from among the house members. Third, the house occasionally helps supply the PC for a task, whether creating a fantastic piece of art or setting out on an adventure to rid the highways of marauding ogres. The house supplies the PC with equipment, the total value of which never exceeds the normal amount owned by a 6th-level NPC ( DMG  127) or an NPC of one level lower than the PC’s level, whichever is smaller. The precise nature of the equipment—weapons or tools, mystical or mundane—depends on the nature and resources of the house itself. The house expects this equipment to be returned within a week or two, and offers such assistance only twice per year (or a third time with a successful DC 25 Diplomacy check). Finally, the PC can use her affiliation with the house to open doors and cut through bureaucracy. By using the house’s name, she can add a +2 circumstance bonus on any Diplomacy or noncombat Intimidate checks made against anyone familiar with the house’s clout (except as noted below), and a +4 circumstance bonus on any Diplomacy or Gather Information checks made while dealing with members or employees of the house. DRAWBACKS OF PATRONAGE While patronage has many advantages, it includes its share of drawbacks as well. First, the PC is expected to regularly publicize her afﬁ liation with the house—and even if she doesn’t, the house will, hoping to make her famous and thus increase its own glory. The PC takes a –2 penalty on all Disguise checks, and on any Bluff checks made to hide or downplay her afﬁ  liation with the house. Similarly, when dealing with anyone who considers the house an enemy (such as a major political rival), the PC takes a –2 penalty on Diplomacy checks instead of gaining the usual +2 bonus. The house expects the PC to do favors and perform tasks for it. In the case of an artist, such obligations might involve creating a particular work as commis-sioned by one of the house members. Adventurers might be asked to undertake specific quests, or pro-vide protection for house members. Whatever the specific requirements, the PC must spend, on average, at least 10 hours per week working on tasks assigned by the house. Failure to do so results in loss of patron- age, as described below. The PC is forbidden from developing close alliances or contacts with anyone the house considers an enemy or rival. Similarly, unless the house has criminal ties, the character is forbidden to fraternize or develop contacts within the underworld. LOSS OF PATRONAGE Should the character ever fail in an assigned task—or in any task that garners public awareness (such as an attempt to rid the city of a haunting, or to successfully open an art gallery)—the house immediately withdraws its patronage, not wishing to be associated with failure. Similarly, the house cuts all ties if the PC ever falls out of public favor, such as being convicted of a major crime (whether truly guilty or not), or makes an enemy of a public ﬁ  gure the house cannot afford to alienate (such as a monarch). HOUSE TYPES Although houses cannot be as neatly categorized as guilds or organizations, most of them focus on one area of expertise above all others. The following sections detail six primary types of houses—both noble and nonnoble—to be found in a standard fantasy city. These divisions represent the different primary concerns a house can have; each house usually has many other interests and areas of inﬂ  uence as well. Each discussion below includes four pieces of informa- tion that the DM and the players can make use of. “Associated Classes” identi ﬁ  es the sorts of people to whom a house is most likely to grant patronage, though these are not necessarily exhaustive. “Associated Skills” mentions those talents for which the house is most widely known. Characters born into a house must purchase at least 1 rank in one of its associ-ated skills. Houses are more likely to grant patronage to someone with at least 4 ranks in an associated skill. A character who does not have either levels in an associated class or ranks in an associated skill is unlikely to ever receive patronage from that house. “Supplies Available” indicates the sort of assistance the house might provide on occasions when it is prepared to assist the PCs in a task. “Sample Contact,” just as in earlier sections of this chapter, is a brief description of an NPC associated with the house and the favor he or she might provide to a character or characters who enjoy the house’s support. MERCANTILE Most mercantile houses are nonnoble families; although a select few noble bloodlines have taken up an inter-est in trade, such activities are usually considered vulgar and cause other nobles to look down upon those individuals. Mercantile houses normally have substantial interest in one or two areas of trade, 620_95386_Ch3.indd   77620_95386_Ch3.indd   77 8/22/06   9:19:33 AM8/22/06   9:19:33 AM78 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERowning many business, warehouses, and caravans. A few have broader reach, influencing the markets of an entire city or region. They often use their influence to guide the actions of local governments, threaten-ing to withhold resources or granting discounts to certain nobles in exchange for favorable treatment. Some mercantile houses own entire towns or hire soldiers to patrol their trade routes. (Whether these are true patrols designed to keep the road safe or paid brigands intended to harass the house’s competitors depends on the house.)

MILITARY Military houses boast a strong tradition of soldier-ing service. They produce a large number of officers and generals, and they gain the most political power during wartime. They are often positioned to profit from wars by running and supporting weaponsmiths, mercenary companies, and the like; less scrupulous military houses often attempt to instigate conflict where none exists in hopes of increasing their fortunes. Some military houses make a practice of sponsoring adventurers (hoping that their glory and success will add to the house’s reputation), while others eschew the use of outside warriors, insisting that they alone are capable of handling any threat.

In other cases, the house might simply study wizardry or other magical arts on a regular basis. Mystical houses often hold great power in a city, particularly in areas well known for monsters or strange beings.

POLITICAL The most common sort of noble house focuses on politics. Such houses certainly have other interests—businesses, military positions, and the like—but they are all side enterprises: means to an end. Their children are raised from infancy to take charge, trained in the arts of deal-making and ruling. Some seek to do well by their people, but many simply want power for the family, and they’ll do whatever it takes to obtain it. Their staples include trading in favors, spreading rumors, and blackmail, and even those political houses that try to rise above such activities must master them if they wish to survive.

UNDERWORLD While a number of noble or mercantile houses possess criminal ties, a rare few are known primarily for their underworld dealings. In some instances, the house’s illegal activities might be publicly known, but the family is clever or powerful enough that the local authorities cannot prosecute. In other instances, a city might be so corrupt that overt criminal houses are the norm; this is most often the case when a criminal house holds the greatest power in the city. Some of these houses earn much of their income through illicit activities, but others are nonnoble bloodlines that have risen to power—at least in the underworld, and possibly in more legitimate circles as well—by funneling criminal profits into legal pursuits (think of them as a fantasy equivalent of the modern-day Mafia). Such houses are among the most frequent patrons of adventurers, since they always have dangerous or dirty tasks that need doing. Good- aligned characters should always beware of making deals with them.",

        "description":  "Any two of the following: Alertness, Deceitful, Investigator, Negotiator, and Stealthy.Special:  Must be a member of House Ebonmar. CLASS FEATURES An inﬁ  ltrator gains abilities focused on both stealth and awareness, augmenting his job as a spy or saboteur. He slowly builds on this focus until he obtains an almost superhuman ability to observe and interpret the world around him. Additionally, he trains in the use of speciﬁ  c spells, also designed to aid in his primary goal of gather-ing secrets. While an inﬁ  ltrator is certainly capable of using disguise and deceit to obtain his goals, his primary techniques are stealth-based; one has no need to lie when one cannot be seen. Weapon and Armor Proficiency: You gain no proficiency with any weapons or armor. If you are proficient with light armor, you can cast infiltrator spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal chance for arcane spell failure. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, an infiltrator wear-ing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs the normal chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass infiltrator still incurs the normal chance for arcane spell failure when casting arcane spells received from other classes. Spells:  Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast an inﬁ  ltra- tor spell, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so if you have an Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Intelligence modiﬁ  er. When you get 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance 1st-level spells for 1st level), you gain only the bonus spells to which you would be entitled based on your Intelligence score for that spell level. Your spell list appears below. You prepare and cast spells just as a wizard does. Piercing Insight (Ex):  Through strenuous training, you learn to more effectively observe the world sur- rounding you. At 1st level, you gain a +1 bonus on Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. These bonuses increase by +1 for every three levels you advance past 1st level in the prestige class (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level). Speed Reader (Ex):  You have learned to interpret text at a rapid rate. You can read a single page of text as a full-round action. This applies even to text read with comprehend languages, or through the use of the Decipher Script spell. Sneak Attack (Ex):  This ability, gained at 2nd level, is like the rogue ability of the same name ( PH 50). The extra damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level and again at 8th level. If you get a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack. Combat Anticipation (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, your ability to effectively observe the world around you allows you to respond more swiftly to danger. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 bonus on both Reflex saves and initiative checks. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level. The bonuses to AC and Reflex saves come in part because you read the intentions of your foe. Thus, you gain those bonuses only against humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and giants. Other creatures are too anatomically differ-ent for you to easily anticipate their intentions. This ability functions only when you are wearing light or no armor. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 4th level, you cannot be caught ﬂ  at-footed and react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. This ability functions like the barbarian ability of the same name (PH 26).

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):  Begin- ning at 8th level, you can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being observed. This ability functions like the ranger ability of the same name ( PH 48). Hyper-Awareness (Su): At 9th level, you ﬁ  nd your perceptions have grown so highly attuned that they become supernatural. You gain darkvision out to 30 feet and blindsense out to 5 feet. Shadow in the Night (Sp):  When you reach 10th level, your mastery of stealth has crossed over into the oth- erworldly. Once per day, you can become ethe-real. This effect lasts for up to 1 round, plus a number of additional rounds equal to your Intelligence modiﬁ  er. This ability otherwise functions as the spell ethereal jaunt .

PLAYING AN EBONMAR INFILTRATOR You prefer stealth to swordplay, avoiding a battle to fighting one. You are direct and driven in your goals to seek out and acquire secrets useful to House Eb-onmar. Everything else is secondary. You normally p r e f e r  t o  w o r k  a l o n e  o r  wi t h  a  t e a m  o f others who share your skills, but if you can find companions who will aid you in your cause, you are more than happy to stick with them. Your relationship with the house is inviolate. Every- thing you do, you do for your family and your blood. Your position within Eb- onmar is rather unusual. As one of their guides, you are well respected, for they know they owe you and your kind much of their success. Yet you can nev- e r  p e r s o n a l l y  g a i n  t h e political prestige that your work provides, for the house cannot afford to place their guides in a public position. Combat Where possible, avoid direct conflict, using your skills and special abil- ities to anticipate and escape from your foes. When battle is inevitable, focus on opponents against whom your special abilities are most effective, leaving creatures such as undead, constructs, and plants for your companions. Strike from concealment or odd angles, taking advan-tage of your sneak attack. Try to use your spells in advance of battle to enhance your companions’ abilities as well as your own. Make liberal use of divinations to determine what you’ll be facing, and plan your strategies accordingly. Advancement Only members of House Ebonmar become infiltra-tors. You were likely born into the house, though it’s conceivable that you married or were adopted into it. The house keeps a constant lookout for members who boast the necessary skills to make a good infiltrator. They observed you for some time before approaching you, watching to ensure that you were not only suf-ficiently able, but also truly loyal to House Ebon mar and its secrets. Only when you had alleviated all their concerns did the family leaders ask you to become a guide.Thobias Ebonmar, an Ebonmar inﬁ  ltratorIllus. by C. Frank 620_95386_Ch3.indd   81620_95386_Ch3.indd   81 8/22/06   9:19:48 AM8/22/06   9:19:48 AM82 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER Unearthing secrets and finding leverage on political rivals is now your primary goal. You remain a member in good standing of the house. In fact, you likely appear at public functions and gatherings, or perhaps even hold a minor position in the household or the city. You are not permitted to take on any role that is too public, however—the house must be able to disavow your actions if you are ever caught. At the same time, people expect members of Ebonmar to seek political power, so you must play the part of behind-the-scenes schemer to some extent. Your spare time is occupied with training, learning new techniques, and perhaps embarking on unrelated adventures to hone your prowess. Once you’ve become an inﬁ  ltrator, put a good portion of your skill points into stealth-related skills; these are your primary advantage in combat, and your only means of effectively carrying out your primary goals. Spread your remaining points evenly around your various class skills, making you sufﬁ  ciently well rounded to understand and acquire information from almost any source. Focus your feat selections on those that will either improve your various skills or augment your spellcasting abilities. Resources Although they will not and cannot be overt about it, the members of House Ebonmar place their aid and resources at your disposal. If necessary, they can provide funding or equipment for a speciﬁ  c mission, an alibi, bail, or even a means of escape if you are captured or arrested and a safe place to hide. In no case, however, will the house ever publicly acknowledge the connection between itself and anyone convicted of a crime or exposed as an inﬁ  ltrator; there- fore, it might cut ties with you at any point if you become a liability. Further, it only supports you when you work for its purposes; don’t expect any sort of aid when you’re off on unrelated adventures. EBONMAR INFILTRATORS IN THE WORLD “Tell you about him? I just said that I saw him in my chambers! Doesn’t mean I can tell you the ﬁ  rst thing about him!” —Lord Beaumond Richhierre, second-tier magistrate Integrating inﬁ  ltrators into an urban campaign is a fairly easy task. House Ebonmar can ﬁ  t into almost any city with ambitious political families. The Ebonmar “guides” are its primary means of acquiring leverage. While little evidence exists to prove the house’s connec- tion with these illicit activities, its use of inﬁ  ltrators is something of an open secret. Thus, any urban  campaign that involves political intrigue is a perfect place for an Ebonmar inﬁ  ltrator. Even if the PCs prefer not to involve themselves in politics, an inﬁ  ltrator might go on unrelated quests in order to hone his skills, or perhaps to get out of town for a while after a mission goes awry. Organization The infiltrators have no organization unique to them- selves; they are simply members of House Ebonmar. Within the house, rank equates to age—the older the member, the higher his position. A council of five patriarchs and matriarchs governs the family; only a majority vote among them can strip a member of rank. Similarly, only the council can send an infiltrator on a mission. Any other members who want an infiltrator to perform a task must petition the patriarchs and matriarchs first. Daily life for an inﬁ  ltrator consists of equal parts high society and secret training. Like others of the family, they put in appearances at upper-class functions, and perhaps spend a few hours working in a minor governmental office. Their spare time consists of training to master their unusual abilities. Individual infiltrators might have their own agendas, but service to the house always comes ﬁ  rst. Failure to abide by this stricture could result in exile from the house—and, if the inﬁ  ltrator knows too much, perhaps a shallow grave in the deep woods. House Ebonmar is not an innately evil family (though it has more than its share of evil members), and the Patri-archs do not order such a step lightly, but neither will they risk a disgruntled and estranged member exposing their techniques. On extremely rare occasions, an infiltrator might accept an outside commission, so long as his actions do not threaten the house or interfere with its plans. A character seeking an inﬁ  ltrator need merely drop word of his interest in locations frequented by Ebonmar mem- bers, servants, and employees. It invariably gets back to the inﬁ  ltrators, who observe the characters in secret for a time. If they agree to a meeting, the inﬁ  ltrators simply show up when the characters are in a place that enables them to converse safely. NPC Reactions Political allies of House Ebonmar greet its members warmly, starting with a friendly attitude ( PH 72). Political enemies are initially unfriendly. Most others are usually indifferent toward members of the house. Few people react to the PC speciﬁ  cally as an inﬁ  ltrator, simply because the character is unlikely to publicize his status. Still, should someone ﬁ  nd out, they will likely view the character with some measure of distrust. If they have heard of the inﬁ  ltrators, their reaction is one step 620_95386_Ch3.indd   82620_95386_Ch3.indd   82 8/22/06   9:19:55 AM8/22/06   9:19:55 AM83CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERnearer hostile than it would otherwise be, unless they are a close ally of the house. INFILTRATOR LORE Characters with ranks in Knowledge (local) or Knowl-edge (nobility and royalty) can research the Ebonmar inﬁ ltrators to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill check, the following lore is revealed, includ- ing the information from lower DCs. DC 10:  Ebonmar inﬁ  ltrators collect secrets and knowl- edge about political and public ﬁ  gures, for use as leverage or even blackmail. Everyone knows they work for House Ebonmar, but nobody’s been able to do anything about it. DC 15:  The infiltrators are highly skilled in meth- ods of stealth, deception, and information-gathering. They’re very hard to catch, and they are experts at avoiding combat. DC 20:  Inﬁ ltrators are capable opponents, able to strike a foe’s weak spots. The greatest among them can see in utter darkness, and even move through solid objects. EBONMAR INFILTRATORS IN THE GAME The inﬁ  ltrators are secretive enough that the DM can easily work them into a campaign under the assumption that they have been active for some time. Alternatively, the PCs might simply have had no reason to deal with House Ebonmar before, or might only now be entering a city or district where the house is active. Players who enjoy stealth or political intrigue are most likely to be drawn to the inﬁ  ltrator. The prestige class makes an excellent spy (its main purpose) but can also become an effective scout, saboteur, or even assassin. Adaptation The Ebonmar infiltrator is easy enough to adapt to most campaigns by simply changing its ﬂ  avor. The class might be associated with a different political house, or with a guild of thieves or assassins. It might be a religious cult devoted to a god of thieves or shadows, in which case you might consider making the spells divine rather than arcane. Alternatively, the class might be associated with a government, representing a cabal of specially trained and mystically enhanced covert operatives. Sample Encounter Most characters who encounter inﬁ  ltrators likely do so in the midst of a mission. Perhaps the PCs are seeking the same objective as the inﬁ  ltrator, or the party might be protecting a nobleman whose secrets the inﬁ  ltrator is after. Alternatively, the PCs might ﬁ  rst meet the inﬁ  l- trator in his guise as a low-ranking member of House Ebonmar, not realizing that he is the same strange ﬁ  gure they’ve been tasked to ﬁ  nd. EL 10: Most infiltrators are loyal members and servants of House Ebonmar, but Thobias Ebonmar is an utter fanatic. He spends all his available time either on missions or training for them, except for those few occasions when he is forced to put on a public face and appear at house functions. When the PCs encounter him, he is staking out his next target—a rival to one of Ebonmar’s up-and-coming scions—gathering information and intelligence for his eventual foray into the man’s home. He initially attempts to flee, but if the PCs corner him, he is willing to fight for his freedom.

Within that broad deﬁ  nition, a guild can appear in countless different forms: large or small, weak or powerful, public or secretive. From the tailors who band together to battle import tariffs, to the religious malcontents who form their own united front against the oppression of the government, to the thieves’ orga-nization that operates in the heart of the poor quarter, guilds are everywhere in a fantasy city. Even two guilds of the same type might differ wildly in appearance and behavior, depending on the people who join and the city in which they dwell. S mall, w eak guil ds ofte n do li ttl e m o r e than pro-vide members a place to belong (and perhaps a bit of financial support), but powerful guilds control entire economic markets, and might even guide the course of their local government. Consider, for instance, a guild that controls the shipping and sale of lumber in a city far from any source of wood, or a powerful mercenary guild that protects a city with an otherwise weak militia. In both cases, the municipal government cannot afford to alienate the guild, giving it substantial leverage to make demands. A guild that becomes this powerful often fixes prices, drafts legislation favor- able to it, or dominates markets otherwise unrelated to its pursuits. GUILD MEMBERSHIP It is far easier to join a guild than to gain the patronage of a noble house. In fact, in some cities, people of a certain profession might be required to join the local guild. Guild membership can be an attractive prospect, though most guilds appeal only to characters who stand to gain from belonging, rather than the party as a whole. That said, many guilds will be of no interest to PCs. It is unlikely that an adventurer has much interest in joining a butchers or bakers guild in his spare time, even if he possesses some skill at butchery or cooking. Adventur-ing-oriented guilds might attract his interest, however, and some characters might indeed seek to join a more mundane guild, if only for a way to earn some money or to practice their skills. JOINING A GUILD Joining a guild is a simple enough prospect; one simply approaches it and petitions for membership. Finding the guildhouse of a particular guild typically requires a DC 10 Gather Information or Knowledge (local) check. A more covert association, such as a thieves or assassins guild, might require a DC 20 or even a DC 25 check. Some secret societies are so well hidden that the party must seek out clues through investigation and adventuring before attempting a supremely dif-ficult (DC 30) skill check. This check can also reveal other information about the guild, such as its general membership requirements, operating procedures, and so on. It is also possible that, if someone has obtained fame or notoriety for a certain skill, the relevant guild might approach him directly. This is a relatively rare occur-rence, however; once someone has mastered a skill to such an extent, he is more likely to form his own guild than to join a preexisting one. Additionally, an estab-lished master is not only far less easily inﬂ  uenced, but far more likely to seek a position of leadership in any organization to which he belongs . . . possibly displacing one of the current guildmasters in the process. Still, some guilds do approach famous practitioners of their selected craft, especially if they believe the benefits outweigh the risks. The various guild types each have associated classes and associated skills. In most cases, a petitioner must either belong to one of these classes or possess 4 ranks in at least one skill to be accepted for membership. Excep-tions to this rule are possible, however, if a character has abilities that the guild can clearly use. For instance, a mercenary guild might accept a sorcerer or warmage into its ranks, if his or her spells would be of particular use on the battleﬁ  eld. Some guilds have additional requirements, such as passing initiation rites or belonging to a certain race or religion. Finally, most guilds gain the bulk of their income through entry fees and membership dues. The average guild requires a one-time entrance fee of 25 gp from a new member, and monthly dues equal to 5 gp per level. (These fees might be higher in richer cities or campaigns, or lower in poorer cities or less economically inﬂ ated campaigns.) BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP Most guilds provide a standard set of benefits, avail- able to all members. While they might vary slightly in specifics, they are generally the same from one guild to the next. Most guildhouses include barracks and kitchens, guaranteeing members food and a safe place to sleep if needed. Guild members help one another out. The initial attitude ( PH 72) of a fellow member is always one step closer to helpful than normal. Additionally, a charac- ter gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks made when dealing with a fellow member. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   84620_95386_Ch3.indd   84 8/22/06   9:20:02 AM8/22/06   9:20:02 AM85CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER A guild subsidizes the cost of goods, supplies, and services related to its chosen ﬁ  eld, reducing the price to a member by 10%. A guild can provide monetary loans to members who have fallen on hard times. Successfully requesting a loan requires a Diplomacy check, with a cumulative –2 penalty for each previous such request made by that individual to that guild. The DC depends on the amount requested. Success indicates that the borrower receives the money, and has one month to pay it back. Should he or she fail to meet the deadline, he or she is (at the very least) expelled from the guild. Some guilds—particularly criminal organizations—have much sterner penalties. Table 3–2: Guild Loans Desired Loan Amount Diplomacy DC Up to the member’s monthly dues 15Up to the member’s monthly dues × 10 20Up to the member’s monthly dues × 100 25 Every guild member gains a contact speciﬁ  c to his or her guild. In addition to the above beneﬁ  ts, particularly active guild members gain additional beneﬁ  ts, depending on the type of guild. This requires the PC to gain the Favored feat (see page 61). DRAWBACKS OF MEMBERSHIP The most obvious drawback to guild membership is, of course, the monthly dues. While most adventurers should have little problem earning this much money, a slow month can cause problems. A member in good standing might be given one month’s leeway, but if she fails to pay her dues (including back-dues) by then, she is expelled. Additionally, many guilds have enemies or rivals among the other guilds of the city. The starting attitude of a member of a rival guild is one step closer to hostile than it would normally be. Guild members have certain responsibilities which they must perform in order to maintain their standing. In some cases, these are fairly minor, such as keeping the guild apprised of certain topics. In others, this responsibility might involve donating a percentage of earnings, or seeking guild permission to undertake certain actions. An individual who fails to pay her dues or perform her duties for more than two consecutive months is expelled from the guild. Similarly, a member who compromises the guild in some manner, such as providing informa-tion to rival guilds, is also expelled. Expulsion results in the immediate loss of all beneﬁ  ts gained from the guild, as well as from the Favored feat (if applicable). If the individual was expelled for failure to perform her duties, all attitudes of guild members return to normal. If she was expelled for betraying the guild, the attitudes of guild members are one step closer to hostile than they would normally be. Some guilds, particularly criminal organizations, might enact steeper penalties—up to and including attempted assassination—in the face of betrayal. GUILD TYPES A single city can have an enormous number of guilds. What follows is not a comprehensive list, but rather a breakdown of the general types of guilds most likely found within a typical fantasy metropolis. The DM should customize these guilds as he sees fit. Each guild should have a unique name, of course, but certain mechanical details might be altered as well. For instance, a smugglers guild might be based on the criminal guild, described below, but with Profession (sailor) substituted for Disable Device in the associ-ated skills list. As discussed above, potential members should have at least one level in an associated class or 4 ranks in an associated skill. “Duties” describes certain actions or concessions members are expected to undertake on the guild’s behalf. “Favored Benefits” lists the advantages a member gains for taking the Favored feat with this particular guild. ADVENTURERS GUILDS This guild is designed expressly for those who battle monsters, hunt treasure, and explore unknown lands. It is far less common than most other types of guilds, and is not appropriate for all campaigns. An adventurers guild is an excellent spot for members to relax, share tales of their exploits, pick up rumors of evil cults within the city or lost ruins without, and meet with prospective employers. Many people looking to hire adventurers come to an adventurers guild ﬁ  rst. In addition, PCs can easily acquire adventuring hirelings or cohorts through the guild, or hire freelance spellcasters to cast spells such as identify  or restoration . In both cases, the guild keeps track of its members’ abilities, and often directs potential employers to the adventurer or party that best ﬁ ts their needs. In settings where adventuring parties can be licensed and registered, such as certain regions of the F ORGOTTEN REALMS ® campaign setting, the guild can handle the necessary paperwork. An adventurers guild offers one additional, and unusual, service. Any time a member embarks on an adventure, he can, if he chooses, ask that the guild send out a search party if he fails to return by a speciﬁ  ed time. He must tell the guild exactly where he expects to be. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   85620_95386_Ch3.indd   85 8/22/06   9:20:06 AM8/22/06   9:20:06 AMWhen a party needs a place to relax, or to sign on for a new mission, an adventurers guild ﬁ  lls the bill 620_95386_Ch3.indd   86620_95386_Ch3.indd   86 8/22/06   9:20:11 AM8/22/06   9:20:11 AM87CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERIf such a search party successfully locates and rescues a trapped or injured adventurer, the search party and the guild each receive 40% of any treasure and valuables the rescued member found on that quest, as the price for their assistance.

Members must ﬁ  ght in the local arena at least once a week, unless they have a solid excuse, or else risk expulsion from the stable (or at least additional ﬁ nancial penalties on their subsequent matches, to make up for the loss). Favored Benefits:  So long as the privilege is not abused, the stable heals a gladiator of injuries suffered outside the arena as well as within. Additionally, in one out of every four matches, the stable takes only 20% of the purse, rather than 30%. Sample Contact:  Albrechd Bearer (human cleric 5). Albrechd will cast a single enhancing spell—such as aid or bull’s strength —on the PC before a match (something that is ofﬁ  cially frowned upon unless cleared ahead of time). Once every 4 months. GOVERNMENT GUILDS Government guilds are unusual in that they blur the line between municipal and private organizations. Many cities lack such guilds—government employees simply work at the behest of their ruler or the city itself. In regions where government guilds do exist, they take one of three forms. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsPROFITS IN THE ARENA On average, assume that the purse for a given gladiatorial match is roughly equal to the value of treasure that would normally be gained for a fight of that Encounter Level (DMG 51). Use the EL of the tougher side, if the two sides are mismatched. For instance, if two 5th-level gladiators (EL 7) face off against an 8th-level gladiator, the purse for the fight averages 3,400 gp—the standard treasure for an EL 8 encounter. Again, this is an average. Precise monies vary depending on the size of the crowd, the popularity of the fighters, and so on. To determine the exact amount of the purse, assume a base of 80% of the above value, and add 2d20%. This gives you a range of 82% to 120% of the standard value for that EL. Note that the gladiators themselves don’t see much of that money. The arena takes an average of 40% off the top from each match, and the stable takes another 30%, leaving a mere 30% to be split among the various fighters on the winning side. So why become a gladiator? Because while an adventurer battling monsters might earn much more from a single treasure hoard, he has no guarantee of ever finding a monster, or of that monster possessing treasure. A gladiator knows that he will see a profit if he wins. Further, the gladiator knows that healing is available to him if he survives the match. Finally, popular gladia-tors can often earn money on the side by betting on themselves or by hiring themselves out as bodyguards. A gladiator who does not belong to a stable lacks the influence and contacts to arrange fights as lucrative as one who does. Such a gladiator earns a purse of only half the normal amount (before the arena takes its cut), receives no free healing or room and board, and must provide his own equipment. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   88620_95386_Ch3.indd   88 8/22/06   9:20:29 AM8/22/06   9:20:29 AM89CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER In the ﬁ  rst form, there is literally no difference between the guild and the city department it represents. Everyone who works in that department is a guild member. The department itself is a guild in only the loosest sense of the word; it’s a portion of the city government that provides its members guildlike beneﬁ  ts. Government guilds of this sort do not require dues of their members, financing themselves instead through taxes and city monies. Characters who join such a guild can actually earn a regular (if relatively small) income, but are required to spend the bulk of their time working for the city and guild. In the second form, the city government subcontracts certain duties to a guild rather than undertaking them directly. For instance, a government might hire a guild to permanently oversee its city watch or handle road maintenance rather than running those departments itself. As above, everyone who works in that department is a guild member, and the guild is ﬁ  nanced through city monies rather than dues. The final variety is a guild in the traditional sense: a private organization, made up of city employees and usually drawn from the same department. Member- ship is not required (or at least the city doesn’t require it; the guild might strongarm people into joining). City workers join the guild for extra benefits, or as a means of gaining some leverage with the government, allowing the guild to negotiate for better pay and hours. This type of guild requires the standard dues of its members. Examples:  City watch, street cleaners guild, embassy.",

Sample Contact:  Tholo Olivander (halﬂ  ing expert 4). Tholo will identify the source of any item—region, culture, perhaps even its creator if it’s distinctive enough. Once per week. MERCENARY GUILDS Like an adventurers guild, a mercenary guild is a place of safety and camaraderie for those who live lives of great danger. The guild provides a centralized location to procure employment, receiving contracts from those who need hired swords and passing them along to its members. In most cases, the reputation of the guild as a whole attracts more (and wealthier) clients than any individual might on his own. Some guilds provide healing for their members; this is not free, or even dis-counted, but at least the individual always knows where to ﬁ nd an available cleric. Similarly, the guildhouse is considered a place of safety, where a member can go to avoid enemies or simply leave the combat and carnage behind for a short while. In an urban environment, the guild serves to legitimize its members: City governments tolerate members of recognized guilds far more readily than they would independent swords-for-hire wandering around their streets. Examples:  District/neighborhood watch, mercenary company. Associated Classes:  Barbarian, fighter, hexblade (Complete Warrior ), monk, ranger, soulknife ( Expanded Psionics Handbook ), warrior.",

CLASS FEATURES A crimson scourge gains abilities that help him track down and subdue sentient beings. He develops these abilities as he gains levels in his class, and in the process grows increasingly difﬁ  cult to dissuade from his objec- tives. While a crimson scourge is capable of using deceit to recover his quarry—and is trained in disguising his appearance should the need arise—he prefers instead to trade on his fearsome reputation, “encouraging” locals to cooperate with him. By the time a scourge masters his class, he has become a coldly efficient tracker of human prey. Weapon and Armor Proﬁ  ciency:  You are proﬁ  cient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (but not tower shields). In addition, you can select one of the following as a free weapon proﬁ  ciency: bolas, net, or whip. Kid Gloves (Ex):  Crimson scourges excel at manipulat- ing the wounds they inﬂ  ict, causing more or less harm as the situation demands. If you choose, you can deal nonlethal damage with weapons that normally deal lethal damage, or lethal damage with weapons that normally deal nonlethal damage—both without taking the usual –4 penalty on the attack roll.  Special Dispensation:  Crimson scourges do not operate in secrecy unless they have to, so their patrons provide them the freedom to perform their duties. While operating in any area where bounty hunting is accept-able, a slavers guild has any presence, or you enjoy the patronage of an inﬂ  uential ﬁ  gure, you gain the beneﬁ  t of the Special Dispensation feat (see page 63), even if you do not meet the prerequisites. Swift Tracker (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, you can make a Gather Information check when using Urban Tracking every half-hour without taking the usual –5 penalty. Painful Strike (Ex): At 3rd level, you gain the ability to deal an extra 1d6 points of nonlethal damage when making a melee attack that deals nonlethal damage against an unarmed opponent. This ability does not func- tion if the opponent has a weapon of any sort in either hand, or if your attack deals lethal damage. Unarmed foes with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat are still considered unarmed. This ability never applies to ranged attacks, regardless of the target’s proximity to you. If you score a critical hit with the melee attack, the extra damage from this ability is not multiplied. This extra damage increases to 2d6 points at 6th level, and to 3d6 at 9th level. Creatures not subject to nonlethal damage, as well as constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures, are not affected by this ability. Immovable Heart (Ex): Your grim profession hard- ens your emotions. Beginning at 4th level, you gain a +2 competence bonus to resist enchantment spells and fear effects. Improved Disarm:  At 5th level, you gain Improved Disarm as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. Threaten (Ex):  Crimson scourges of at least 7th level are masters at shaking the conﬁ  dence of their foes. This ability grants three advantages when you use the Intimidate skill to demoralize an opponent ( PH 76). First, you can attempt to demoralize an opponent as a move action, rather than a standard action. Second, a success-ful attempt causes the target to be shaken for a number of rounds equal to your unmodiﬁ  ed Strength modiﬁ  er 620_95386_Ch3.indd   93620_95386_Ch3.indd   93 8/22/06   9:20:49 AM8/22/06   9:20:49 AM94 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER(minimum 1 round). Finally, you gain a +2 bonus on any Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent. Deadened Hide (Ex): Upon reaching 8th level, you become immune to nonlethal damage and to spells or effects that inﬂ  ict or manipulate pain (DM’s discretion). Smell of Blood (Ex): At the apex of your advancement, you acquire an almost animalistic awareness of the world around you. You gain the scent ability ( MM  314) and a +3 insight bonus on initiative checks. PLAYING A CRIMSON SCOURGE",

        "description":  "someone capable of being stealthy and subtle, but who rarely needs to be. People like you aren’t called “crimson scourges” for nothing. Your very existence serves as a deterrent against escape. If you are neutral-aligned, you likely don’t deserve much of what’s said about you, but it’s against your financial interests to set the record straight. If you’re evil, it’s probably all true. Your relationship with your employer is the most important thing for you. Whether or not your loyalty is genuine, without the safety of your patron, your numerous enemies would not hesitate to pounce. You prefer to work alone, but sometimes scourges are hired in pairs—nominally for their safety, but mainly to keep tabs on a suspect hunter. Combat Crimson scourges never shy away from com- bat, and more often than not they will instigate a fight just to prove a point. Most of your skills revolve around tracking and disarming (and of- ten humiliating) a single individual. You’re not terribly effective in fights involving multiple foes, so bravado is a large part of your com- bat ability: If you can intimidate your op- ponent into backing down, you’ve won without striking a single blow. If melee is inevitable, focus on making the most of your abilities. Strike at unarmed assailants first, to try to take them out of combat quickly , and then move to disarming those who carry weapons so you can do the same to them. Advancement Unless you are in business for yourself, your advancement potential relies heavily upon a slavers guild or patron organization. The more successful you are at what you do, the more rapidly you’ll advance. Sometimes an employer or guild sends scourges out in pairs—one junior tracker and one veteran. Although true friendship between them rarely blooms, the elder usually ends up taking on the role of mentor. You were already a competent tracker before becom-ing a true scourge, but you should continue to make hunting skills a priority when the time for skill point allotment arrives. Before a single blow is landed, your strongest advantages in combat are your reputation and your perceived ability to back up that reputation. Make sure that Intimidate is as high a priority as Gather Infor- mation. Focus your feat selection on developing tricks of the trade, such as Improved Disarm, Improved Grap- ple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Im proved Trip, and Improved Sunder. Resources Depending on its size and public per- sona, a slavers guild usually funds its scourges’ retrieval efforts . . . provided it has concrete informa- tion on where a target has gone, and it has a good idea of what the op- eration will cost. If you’re a member of the guild and possess the Favored feat, then you’re entitled to such aid should you ask for it. If you are in the employ of a wealthy patron, you can re- ceive some compensation for your expenses, especially if you have performed satisfactory work for that employer before. Your work often takes you into areas with no guild presence or where slavers are reviled (if you are a hunter of slaves), or into the underworld (if you pursue crimi- nals). In those environments, you’re on your own. For this reason, be sure to fix the terms of employment before venturing out after a quarry. Geddrik the Whip, a crimson scourgeIllus. by J. Hodgson 620_95386_Ch3.indd   94620_95386_Ch3.indd   94 8/22/06   9:20:53 AM8/22/06   9:20:53 AM95CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERCRIMSON SCOURGES IN THE WORLD “They provide a necessary service, of course. But I do wish they could be a bit more . . . discreet.” —Lord Beaumond Richhierre, second-tier magistrate Crimson scourges are suitable for almost any city. They can appear in areas with little to no slave trade, focusing entirely on escaped criminals, or be in the employ of slavers guilds but hunting in areas where escaped slaves have fled. On occasion, a slavers guild sends a pair of scourges into a town where the trade hasn’t yet blossomed. The scourges quietly investigate factors such as the rich–poor divide, the socioeconom-ic dynamic, and the attitude of the ruling class toward indentured servitude, evaluating the potential for a new market. Organization C rim s o n  s c o ur g e s  h a v e  li ttl e  o r g aniza ti o n  un t o  th e m -selves. Aside from the mentor–student relationship that develops between pairs, they neither want nor need additional complication in their lives. The only structure that the scourges recognize is an informal system of rank, based upon a combination of achievement and reputation. The more successful the scourge, and the more fearsome his reputation, the more respect he gains from his peers. Nonevil scourges also depend on successful retrievals but value independence far more than ferocity; A scourge who can dictate his own terms earns more respect in the eyes of his peers than one known only for intimidating his quarry. Daily life for the average scourge consists of countless hours of training and waiting, interspersed with frenetic bouts of activity. Scourges have to keep themselves sharp, but unless they’re on active assignment, they have little to do but wait. For this reason, crimson scourges often take assignments as bodyguards or enforcers, serving either the guild or independent parties. In some cases, a scourge is retained permanently , which provides him or her a steady stream of work. Non-evil scourges tend to refuse exclusivity arrangements. Only by committing to a job and then leaving immediately upon success can such scourges maintain their objectiv- ity and independence. NPC Reactions By their very nature, scourges elicit fear and unfriendly suspicion from those they meet. Other people might still be helpful to a scourge, but out of fear rather than admiration or respect. Only slavers react to them more favorably than unfriendly, and even they are usually indifferent.CRIMSON SCOURGE LORE Characters with ranks in Knowledge (local) or bardic knowledge can research crimson scourges to learn more about them. When a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower DCs. DC 10:  Slavers guilds and city watches sometimes use fearsome trackers to hunt down fugitive criminals and escaped slaves. DC 15:  These so-called crimson scourges are highly skilled not only in hunting their quarry but in causing pain without dealing lethal injury. They are known for their callousness. DC 20:  Crimson scourges have a talent for dealing massive amounts of pain to unarmed opponents, and for disarming opponents who might otherwise provide a threat. The best of them feel no pain at all. CRIMSON SCOURGES IN THE GAME The crimson scourge ﬁ  lls a speciﬁ  c enough niche that a DM can easily work the class into a campaign under the assumption that the PCs have simply never heard of the scourges before (especially if none of the PCs have ever been in an area with a slavers guild). Players who enjoy search-and-recover adventures, as well as those who embrace the challenge of a morally complex character, might be drawn to the crimson scourge class. As an NPC, a scourge makes an excellent adversary, whether encountered on the trail of a PC who is an escaped slave, or as a threat to an acquaintance or relative of a party member. Adaptation The crimson scourge is suitable for just about any urban campaign setting. Even if your setting features no slavers guild, slaves probably exist somewhere. And as long as there are fugitives, whether criminals on the run or missing property, there will always be crimson scourges to bring them in. In a setting without slaves, the class might be associated with a variant organiza- tion, such as a thieves or assassins guild. Scourges might even form the retrieval arm of a cult that endorses slavery, in which case every scourge would be a member of the cult. Sample Encounter A character who has reason to encounter a scourge prob- ably has reason to quarrel with him, too. Most run-ins with crimson scourges take place in the midst of recovery operations, while the scourge is tracking down a fugitive. In these situations, a scourge is less inclined to banter or negotiate. EL 9:  Almost every scourge takes care to foster a nasty reputation, but the soon-to-be infamous Geddrik 620_95386_Ch3.indd   95620_95386_Ch3.indd   95 8/22/06   9:20:59 AM8/22/06   9:20:59 AM96 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERRaud—the so-called “Whip”—is making an art form out of it. He takes the nickname of his trade literally, scourg- ing the backs of recaptured slaves for every misstep on the way back to their owners. When the PCs encounter him, he is just about to recover his latest target: the child of an escaped slave, whom Geddrik intends to use as leverage against the mother. Geddrik’s arrogance could be his undoing. He refused to partner up with a mentor, and he might have to ﬂ  ee if the PCs get the drop on him or are tougher than the unarmed wretches the Whip is used to bullying.

Noble houses are limited by lineage and nature, while guilds are limited by the types of goods and services offered within the community. Organizations, on the other hand, can arise from, focus on, and work toward a myriad of different topics. They can exist and work publicly, or they can operate in secret, their very existence becoming mere rumor outside their ranks. Organizations play a vital role in the urban fantasy cam- paign, from the demonic cult threatening to despoil the city from within, to the adventuring company whose heroic deeds and exploits have become the talk of the town. Belonging to an organization might not carry the prestige that comes with garnering the patronage of a noble house, nor the ﬁ  nancial windfall of advanc- ing to the top of a powerful guild, but it can provide a far greater sense of belonging and accomplishment than either of the other two achievements could hope to offer. MEMBERSHIP Membership in organizations runs the gamut of possibili- ties. Some are easier to join than guilds, and others are more difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  nd (let alone join) than even the most discriminating noble house. Because of their compara- tively narrow focus, the spectrum of organizations is vast, with an equally vast array of membership expectations and requirements. JOINING AN ORGANIZATION Generally speaking, joining an organization is the hardest part of being a member. Unlike guilds, which tend to maintain very high proﬁ  les, most organizations operate either quietly or in complete secrecy. For many prospective members, attracting an organization’s attention is more important than actively petition-ing for membership; some organizations induct new members only by invitation. How a given organization solicits or inducts new members depends on its precise nature. A political action committee with headquarters on the main thoroughfare is likely to draw new mem- bers off the street, whereas a secret society determined to overthrow the current government is in serious trouble if complete strangers can come calling about joining up. As a rule, ﬁ  nding a point of contact for a particular organization requires a base DC 15 Gather Information or Knowledge (local) check. This check is modified by the nature of the organization sought: a fairly open organization, such as a political action group, might require only the base DC 15, whereas a truly secret society, such as a band of revolutionaries, might require a DC 25 check. Some organizations are so well hidden that the seeker must suss out clues through investigation and adventuring before even attempting the check (DC 30 or higher). As with guilds, a successful check reveals additional information about the organization, such as membership requirements, operating procedures, and so on. Most organizations don’t have the standardized class or skill requirements that guilds do. An organization’s entry requirements depend on the nature of its work. Some require only oaths of loyalty or signatures on 620_95386_Ch3.indd   96620_95386_Ch3.indd   96 8/22/06   9:21:03 AM8/22/06   9:21:03 AM97CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERmembership forms, while others demand proof of true loyalty or sacrifice, often in the form of blood (their own or another’s), money, or magic items. Some organizations demand nothing from new members, preferring to let time determine just how worthwhile an individual is. Although organizations don’t generally gain the bulk of their operating capital from membership fees and dues, some still ask for money, either up front or on a regular basis. As a rule, if an organization requires an entrance fee of more than 25 gp from a new member, it does not demand any regular dues thereafter (though speciﬁ  c circumstances might demand ﬁ  nancial contributions). If the organization does not require an entrance fee, but still wants to collect revenue from its members on a monthly basis (a rare occurrence), such dues generally don’t exceed 5 gp per level. BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP Though each organization is unique, most organiza-tions of a certain type have a standard set of beneﬁ  ts available to every member. As with guilds, these ben-eﬁ ts vary, but the following information serves as a good default. Most organizations of sufﬁ  cient size have chapter- houses, which include barracks, stables, and a kitchen, guaranteeing members food and a safe place to sleep when they are in need. In the case of an organization without a chapterhouse, members are expected to host fellow members in need, either by paying for a room at a local inn or by offering their own abodes. They are not usually required to do so any more frequently than two nights per month. Organizations are nothing if not active. Most have tasks to accomplish, for which they invariably rely on their members. When an organization asks a member to complete a task or go on a mission, it usually funds the effort fully, providing equipment and expenses its leaders deem sufﬁ  cient for the task. The total value of this assistance never exceeds the normal amount owned by a 6th-level NPC ( DMG  127) or an NPC of one level lower than the PCs’ level, whichever is smaller. Most organiza- tions expect their members to return equipment when the mission is concluded. Fellow members of a given organization come to one another’s assistance. The initial attitude of a fellow member is always one step closer to helpful than his normal starting attitude. Additionally, a character gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks made when dealing with a fellow organization member. Every member gains one contact specific to his organization when he ﬁ  rst joins; furthermore, gaining additional contacts within his organization is easier than looking for contacts in other social circles. If a new would- be contact belongs to the character’s organization, his or her starting attitude need only be friendly rather than helpful. In addition, a PC who belongs to an organization can maintain one extra contact (for a total of Cha bonus +1 instead of Cha bonus), provided the bonus contact is also a fellow member. Particularly active members gain additional beneﬁ  ts, depending on the type of organization. As with guilds, these beneﬁ  ts require the PC to possess the Favored feat (page 61). DRAWBACKS OF MEMBERSHIP The primary drawback of most organizations is that they require a substantial investment of time and energy on the part of their members. Unlike guilds, which typically don’t care what their members do so long as they pay their dues on time and don’t cause trouble, organizations have a vested interest in their members’ activities. Like guilds, many organizations also have enemies among other city factions, including guilds, houses, and rival organizations. The starting attitude of any rival of the PC’s organization is one step closer to hostile than normal, assuming the rival knows that the PC is some-how afﬁ  liated. Organizations are less public about their activities than either guilds or houses, and few want their secrets to become common knowledge. Members are expected to uphold certain codes of conduct, which vary from group to group but almost always involve keeping quiet about the lives and affairs of fellow members. Those who betray such secrets are expelled from the organization—or worse. In some cases, select nonmem- bers (such as a trusted member’s closest companions) might be allowed to learn of the member’s allegiances, but such informality always requires special dispensa- tion from a superior in the organization. Any problems arising from a companion’s loose lips are the member’s sole responsibility. An individual who is expelled from an organization faces a number of different consequences, depending on the nature of both the expulsion and the organiza-tion. At a bare minimum, an ex-member immediately loses all benefits gained from membership in the organization, and from the Favored feat if applicable. If an individual was expelled for failing to serve the organization as expected, or due to the actions of a com- panion, all attitudes of organization members toward him return to normal. If the expulsion came about as a result of betrayal, the attitudes of organization mem- bers move one step closer to hostile than they would otherwise. Some organizations, particularly criminal groups and religious sects, enact sterner punishments for betrayal. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   97620_95386_Ch3.indd   97 8/22/06   9:21:07 AM8/22/06   9:21:07 AM98 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER Expulsion from an organization is almost always per- manent. Whereas a guild usually allows an ex-member to buy his way back in repeatedly (if at ever-increasing cost), most organizations won’t readmit an expelled member for any price. ORGANIZATION TYPES Houses often depend on a feudal social structure, and guilds require ﬁ  nancial activity, but organizations appear in just about every urban environment, no matter what the size or local ﬂ  avor. They often arise from a particular ev ent, situation, or cause, which is reﬂ  ected in their names, behaviors, and beliefs. Below is a broad outline of the general types of organizations most commonly found in an urban D\u0026D campaign. Whereas potential guild members must possess at least one level in an associated class or a minimum of 4 ranks in an associated skill, organizations’ entry require- ments are more situation-speciﬁ  c. An organization that catalogs the identity and activities of every psionic soul in town might naturally refuse to consider a psionic character for admission; on the other hand, it might deem such a recruit a valuable source of information, or even a means of “ﬁ  ghting ﬁ  re with ﬁ  re.” Common sense should guide decisions about which characters would be well received by a given organization. As with guilds, the Duties entry describes certain actions or concessions all members are expected to shoulder, while Favored Beneﬁ  ts lists the advantages a member gains for having the Favored feat for the organization in question. Each type of organization also includes a sample contact. ARCANE ORGANIZATIONS The typical arcane organization is dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge, and often to the study of a particular phenomenon or related group of phenom- ena. Some strive to understand creatures of a particular type or origin (such as ﬁ  ends or aberrations), while others are devoted to discovering new or long-forgotten magical rites and artifacts. The various members of a given arcane guild (see page 87) might belong to a number of different arcane organizations, though few individuals claim membership in more than one. Passion, loyalty, and interest in the organization’s charter topic are the main factors in acceptance. A largely unqualified member with a passion for the given topic could receive greater consideration than a qualiﬁ  ed member with little interest in pursuing the group’s goal.",

        "description":  "At 4th level, you can draw upon your urban knowledge to learn a foe’s weakness in combat. Against humanoids, a successful Knowledge check reveals the target’s Hit Dice, damage reduction (including the means to overcome it, if any), and saving throws. Against nonhumanoids, it imparts all of the above information plus any special weaknesses the foe might have. Again, the player must roleplay any information he wishes his character to impart within the game. Methods:  When you reach 7th level, your knowledge of your foes’ methods helps direct your attacks more effectively. With a successful Knowledge check, you grant yourself and your allies a +1d6 bonus on weapon damage rolls against the target for 1 minute. If you suc- ceed on the check by 10 or more, this bonus increases to +2d6. If you succeed by 20 or more, this bonus increases to +3d6. True Nature:  The culmination of an urban savant’s studies is the ability to grasp the true nature of a target creature. When you attain 10th level, a successful Knowledge check grants you and all allies within 60 feet a mystic barrier that acts in all respects (includ-ing duration) as a protection from chaos/evil/good/law spell, granting a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against its abilities. This protection functions regardless of the creature’s true alignment (even if neutral), but its effects do not stack with any actual protection or magic circle spells in effect. Your caster level for the purpose of this ability is equal to your urban savant level. If you succeed on the check by 10 or more, the bonuses to AC and saves increase to +3. If you succeed by 20 or more, the bonuses increase to +4. Urban Empathy (Ex):  You can use your knowledge to improve the attitude of creatures you encounter in urban environments. This ability applies only to animals, humanoids, and monstrous humanoids (oozes and vermin being typically mindless). At the DM’s dis- cretion, this ability could work on certain aberrations as well, though most are too violent and unpredictable for such tactics. You can choose to substitute the appropriate Knowl-edge check (local for humanoids or nature for animals and monstrous humanoids) in place of a Diplomacy check to inﬂ  uence the starting attitudes of those you encounter in cities. If the DM opts to allow use of this ability on aberrations, the substitution would be a Knowledge (dungeoneering) check. If you prefer, you can make the usual Diplomacy checks for humanoids and monstrous humanoids instead. Against animals, this ability func-tions like a druid’s wild empathy class feature ( PH 35), adding your urban savant level to the check, or you can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check if that is likely to produce a better result. Continuing Education (Ex):  At 3rd level, you gain a +1 insight bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nature) checks. You gain a similar bonus on all bardic knowledge checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level and +3 at 9th level. Eyes of the City (Ex):  By the time you reach 5th level, your vision has surpassed that of other city- dwelling humans. You gain low-light vision, allowing you to see twice as far and as clearly as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similarly shad-owy conditions. If you already have low-light vision, your existing ability improves, allowing you to see three times as far as a normal human in conditions of shadowy illumination. Pierce Deception: Upon reaching 8th level, you know intuitively how the city is supposed to look. While in an urban environment, you can try to see through the decep- tion of any object or creature that might be disguising its true appearance. Make a DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you know whether or not the target’s true appearance has been clouded, but not by what means, nor what its true appearance might be. If the check succeeds by 10 or more, you know by what means the target’s appearance has been altered (through use of the Disguise skill, magic, a natural shapechanging ability, or the like). If the deception is magical, you can attempt a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level) to determine the spell used. PLAYING AN URBAN SAVANT Although you take great pride in your role as defender of your city, you have no illusions about your capabili-ties in melee combat. You work best when aiding and guiding the swords of others, not when attempting to swing your own. You are no stereotypical dusty scholar, but you know that your greatest asset is your brain, not your muscles. You worked hard to be admitted into the distinguished League of Eyes, so you are loath to do anything that would violate the trust of the organization. You might enjoy the occasional glory that comes with assisting the watch in beating back some new threat, but knowing that you 620_95386_Ch3.indd   102620_95386_Ch3.indd   102 8/22/06   9:21:28 AM8/22/06   9:21:28 AM103CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERperformed your duty means more than all the fame in the world. Combat In combat, you primarily support your fellow party mem- bers and do not engage in front-line heroics. If you were a bard before becoming an urban savant, your ability to aid your compatriots is especially powerful. Hang back with the spellcasters, if that’s the party’s strategy, and use your skills, abilities, and spells (if you have any) to bolster your allies and corrode their foes’ defenses. If you began your career as a ranger or rogue, you can play a more direct role in combat—but prepare your allies ﬁ  rst. Advancement Only a certain breed of individual enters the ranks of the urban savants. An invitation to join is difﬁ  cult to obtain, even more so than one to enter the League of Eyes itself. You are primarily a scholar, but you must be willing to place yourself in direct danger. Even the most passionate and patriotic member of the League thinks twice about taking up this class.  Once you have started down the path of the savant, you should continue to invest a good portion of your skill points on Knowledge skills. Your learning is your primary advantage (even in combat), and the only means of advancing within your organization. If you are also a spellcaster, consider acquiring new divination spells to aid both you and your fellow members in the pursuit of your collective goals, and party-support spells to supple- ment your class abilities. Resources Although the League of Eyes is far from wealthy, it can lend some aid and resources. Since you are already favored within your organization, you can call on many contacts for assistance should the need arise. In addition, your organization fully funds any mission it assigns to you; such funding typically includes a cash stipend for food and other expenses. URBAN SAVANTS IN THE WORLD “If they truly want to help the city, I wonder why they need to remain so secretive. Don’t you?” —Lord Beaumond Richhierre, second-tier magistrate Integrating urban savants into an urban campaign is remarkably easy. Even in a game that has no League of Eyes, the class could represent a similar confederation dedicated to protecting the city. Even if no organization exists in a campaign to support it, the urban savant (with some adjustment) still functions admirably as a stand-alone prestige class. Organization Urban savants belong to the League of Eyes (or a similar organization) and occupy a special role within its ranks. Since its inception, the League has used an internal hierarchy based on title and color. A member who ﬁ  rst joins the League is known as a watcher. These are the most numerous members in the organization, usually mid-level experts or low-level members of adventur- ing classes (often bards and wizards). When a League member has gained sufficient skill to qualify for the urban savant prestige class, her title changes to wit-ness, whether she ultimately adopts the class or not. Witnesses are some of the most educated members in the League; only members of that rank can train others. The highest title within the League is monitor, which is bestowed on only the most inﬂ  uential and learned members of the organization.  A witness who joins the ranks of the urban savants acquires the title of vigilant. A vigilant who is later promoted to monitor—or, in rarer cases, a monitor who becomes a vigilant late in her career—can add the new title onto her existing one as an honoriﬁ  c, making her a “vigilant monitor.” Color, the second indicator of status within the orga- nization, plays a similar role in differentiating members. The League’s ofﬁ  cial colors are the same as those on the ﬂ ag of the city the League protects: for example, vermil- ion, emerald, and black. Within the League, each color corresponds to a different area of expertise or focus for the member in question: vermilion for humanoids and monstrous humanoids, emerald for animals and vermin, and black for aberrations and oozes. Members choose the color that best suits them, creating titles such as “emerald witness” and “black vigilant.” Vigilant monitors, however, are above such distinctions. NPC Reactions Most residents of the city in which an urban savant dwells react well to her (if they know of her affili-ation), starting with a friendly attitude. Rivals and those with whom the League has clashed start with an unfriendly attitude. All others begin with an indif- ferent attitude. These guidelines notwithstanding, few individuals have the opportunity to react to a PC urban savant speciﬁ  cally as a member of that class, because the League discourages public attention. Still, word gets around, and a savant who has regularly served with other city defenders soon develops a good reputation. URBAN SAVANT LORE Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowl-edge (history), or Knowledge (local) can research the League of Eyes and its urban savants to ﬁ  nd out more 620_95386_Ch3.indd   103620_95386_Ch3.indd   103 8/22/06   9:21:32 AM8/22/06   9:21:32 AM104 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERabout them. When a character makes a skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower DCs DC 10:  Rumors of a secret society called the League of Eyes have existed for years. DC 15:  The League is dedicated to the protection of the city and its people. It uses a specially trained type of scholar known as an urban savant to aid in its work. DC 20:  Urban savants are skilled and knowledgeable, trained to counter the city’s traditional threats. They can turn a clumsy band of untrained warriors into an elite ﬁ ghting machine by providing information and tactics to overcome speciﬁ  c opponents. URBAN SAVANTS IN THE GAME The League and its savants are easy to work into a cam- paign if the PCs have never been to their city before. If the party comes from that region, the League’s secre-tive nature makes a ﬁ  ne excuse for the lack of prior knowledge. If the city hasn’t faced wide-scale threats of the sort in which the League specializes, it stands t o  r e a s o n  t h a t  t h e  P C s  w o u l d n ’ t  h a v e  e n c o u n t e r e d  urban savants. Players who enjoy playing knowledge- or skill-based characters are among the most likely to be drawn to the urban savant, as are those who appreciate the class’s devotion to a just cause. Most of the savant’s class abilities function in any surrounding, so players need not worry if the campaign sends their characters away from their home base. Adaptation Integrating the urban savant into a campaign is a simple matter of adjusting its tone or flavor. Instead of being associated with the League of Eyes, the class could just as easily be a part of a shadowy government organization or an extension of the city militia. The prestige class makes a good fit for any setting that includes cities. Sample Encounter Urban savants spend much of their time in research or private study, so most PCs encounter them either on patrol or attached to a group of soldiers dealing with an active threat. Perhaps the PCs have caught wind of the same creature or plot the savant is pursuing. Alterna-tively, they might ﬁ  rst meet the savant in an unrelated context, without realizing to whom or what the NPC is connected. EL 11:  Freilya Stormwind is one of the most dedicated vigilants in the League of Eyes. After a particularly horrific encounter with an aberration in her youth, she dedicated herself to purging her home of all things vile and predatory. Recently, she caught the trail of an unnatural creature using the sewers to move around the city and hunt for prey. When the PCs encounter Freilya, she’s sneaking around the sewer entrances in the poor quarter. If she is threatened or attacked, she attempts to flee and return with members of the Watch.

Religion moves and guides people with greater force and efﬁ  cacy than any law, for in the eyes of the believer, no monarch, no governor, no magistrate is above the gods themselves. Churches wield an enormous amount of power in many cities, though how effectively depends on both the church itself and the government that ostensibly rules it. A strong or despotic government might keep local churches small and weak; similar- ly, some churches are not inclined to interfere in po- litical affairs. On the other hand, some churches dominate the gov- ernment, either openly in a theo-cratic culture, or by manipulating it from behind the scenes. Most cities ﬁ  nd a hap- py medium, with the government handling legal issues and the churches leading the community on social ones, but in less harmonious cities, political and even overt physical conflict might erupt between the two. In this context, the term “church” does not refer to a speciﬁ  c house of worship or similar structure; such a place is, in D\u0026D terms, a temple, a cathedral, or a shrine, depending on size and build. A church is a religious institution, a sociopolitical body in its own right. For instance, the Church of Pelor in a given city likely encompasses all the local temples and priests of Pelor. JOINING A CHURCH Being a member of a church actually has two very distinct meanings. Most individuals who choose to worship with others at a temple or shrine could be considered members of their church; for clarity, they are hereafter referred to as congregants. This status grants a worshiper a number of acquaintances and a social support group to whom she can turn in time of need, making her a part of a religious community. Congregants need perform only a few duties for their church, beyond following the tenets of the religion. They are encouraged to donate at least a small sum of money to the fold, or else devote a few hours a week in service to the temple. The precise amounts of money and time depend on the size of the church to which the temple belongs. On a deeper level, one can become a formal member of a church by actually joining the institution. Most priests of a given god are part of that god’s church, but the church’s personnel is not lim- ited to priests. Temple guards and holy war- riors, researchers, bookkeepers, travel- ing friars, even temple grounds keepers can be ofﬁ  cial members of a church. Such in- dividuals gain many more beneﬁ  ts and much higher status than the laypeople, but must also per-form a great many duties in the name of their god and the church hierarchy.  While it’s easy enough to become a congregant of a church, attaining formal member- ship is harder. One must be a recognized priest of the church’s god—a task that involves more than merely possessing levels in cleric or a simi- lar class—or else seek employment with the church directly. This process is handled much like approach- ing a guild for membership. It requires a DC 10 Gather Information or Knowledge (local) check to ﬁ  nd the of- ﬁ ces or temple of a high-ranking member of a public church. A secret sect might require a lengthy quest for clues, followed by a Gather Information or Knowledge (local) check with a DC of 25, 30, or even higher. As with other organizations, those who desire membership in a church must either have levels of an appropriate class or 4 ranks in an appropriate skill. In the case of churches, the associated classes are always the same: cleric, favored soul ( Complete Arcane ), and paladin. Associated skills for each type of church are Against the strength of a united church, even the highest of nobles must bendIllus. by B. Hagan 620_95386_Ch3.indd   105620_95386_Ch3.indd   105 8/22/06   9:21:39 AM8/22/06   9:21:39 AM106 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERgiven in the sections below. An individual who aspires to membership must also be a follower of the church’s god. In some instances, a church might make an exception to the above requirements if an individual has other useful abilities. The Church of Boccob, for instance, might permit a powerful sorcerer to join because of his magical abilities. Similarly, the churches of martial gods, such as Heironeous or Hextor, might permit ﬁ  ghters, hexblades, and warriors to join even if they lack the associated skills. A great number of churches require that all their members follow the same behavioral strictures as their clerics—in game terms, that they be within one step of their deity in alignment. Some churches have additional restrictions, such as an oath of secrecy (possibly enforced through spells such as mark of justice ), a ceremony of allegiance, a quest or activity to prove one’s faith, and so forth. Not everyone joins a church for the same reason. Some are true believers who simply wish to serve their god in whatever way they can. Others see the church as a source of employment; they are faithful enough, but act primar- ily for money, not devotion. Still others see it as an easier or greater path to power than a career in politics. BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP Congregants in a church gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks involving other congre- gants and members of the same church. Other members of their speciﬁ  c temple—but not other temples of the same church—have a starting attitude one step closer to helpful than they would normally have ( PH 72). Higher-ranking members of the church, such as priests or other church employees, gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks involving other members and congregants of the same church, and a +1 bonus on those checks involving worshipers of the same god who, for whatever reason, are not part of the local church. Additionally, so long as they remain members in good standing, they receive a 5% discount on any spells they hire other church members to cast. (This discount applies only to the cost of casting; the character must still provide the full value of any material components.) Upon becoming a formal member of the church, a character gains one new contact. Finally, members (but not congregants) can acquire the Favored feat (see page 61). Note that all skill benefits for church membership stack with any benefits granted by membership in a religious guild or organization. So, however, do the various duties—possibly leaving a character very little free time. DRAWBACKS OF MEMBERSHIP In the case of congregants, membership in a church requires little more than regular (or at least occasional) participation in temple services and holidays, and that the individual not blatantly and publicly violate any religious precepts. Congregants are encouraged to volunteer either their money or their time, but the amounts are extremely modest. A congregant might be exiled from her temple—and thus, the larger church—if she grossly violates any religious precepts, if she utterly refuses to donate even the smallest bit of money or time, or if she completely ceases attend-ing services. True members must devote a substantial amount of their time to performing church- and faith-related duties, often leaving them precious little time for anything else. Failure to perform these duties, or even the slightest hint of a member acting outside the precepts of the faith, can result in expulsion (or even execution, in the case of evil or extremist churches). In addition, religious conﬂ  ict is common in most D\u0026D settings, and any member or congregant of a church might ﬁ  nd herself a target for the enemies of her god. CHURCH TYPES Churches are, if anything, even harder to divide into functional types than noble houses. Individual temples (and the church as a whole) vary widely from culture to culture and city to city, let alone between deities. The Church of Pelor in Blackwall is different than the Church of Pelor in Four Winds, for example, and both of them are markedly different than the Church of Erythnul in either city. The following entries categorize churches in extremely broad terms, breaking them down by overall size and level of importance in a given region. The beneﬁ  ts and pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsPRIEST OR CLERIC? It’s worth noting that not all priests must be clerics. A priest is defined as someone recognized by a church or temple as a reli-gious leader, someone well versed in religious lore and capable of leading the faithful in prayer and services. Many priests are clerics or favored souls, of course. Others, however, are simply experts or other classes who are both faithful worshipers and scholars of the faith. This is particularly true in the E BERRON  cam- paign setting, where clerics are actually in the minority among active priests, but applies in most other settings to a greater or lesser extent. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   106620_95386_Ch3.indd   106 8/22/06   9:21:46 AM8/22/06   9:21:46 AM107CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERrequirements are equally broad, and DMs are encouraged to personalize the material for their own campaigns. The given examples include churches that often qualify for that category, not churches that always do. The Church of Pelor is dominant in many cities, but not all, and it might have a smaller presence in other areas as well. The lists of associated skills are intended as a guidelines, and should be expanded as appropriate. For example, the Church of Ehlonna might include Knowledge (nature) and Survival as associated skills, while the Church of Wee Jas probably includes Knowledge (arcana), and the Church of Yondalla might include Speak Language (Halﬂ  ing). The “Duties” and “Favored Beneﬁ  ts” entries are also very general and broad in scope, and should serve primarily as a springboard for further development. DOMINANT A dominant church is a massive, powerful organization that might rival the local government in terms of author- ity. (In fact, in theocracies, the dominant church might also act as the local government.) It boasts numerous temples or shrines, often among the largest and wealthiest in the area. A dominant church claims a sizable portion of a city’s population among its congregants. It is rare for a city to have more than one dominant church, and few have more than three or four. A dominant church often encompasses a number of r e l i g i o u s  g u i l d s  a n d  o r g a n i z a t i o n s ,  a s  w e l l  a s  s e v e r a l  denominations (see Sect, below). It has vast resources at its disposal, and it might even be richer than the city in which it resides. It invariably holds some sway with the local government, with many congregants in high positions or serving as advisors to the local rulers. Most dominant churches have reached far beyond the conﬁ  nes of any one particular community. Some boast cathedrals in every major city in the campaign world and a single center of power from which the highest priest, archbishop, pontiff, or prelate hands down dictates in the name of his deity.

Once per year. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   108620_95386_Ch3.indd   108 8/22/06   9:21:53 AM8/22/06   9:21:53 AMn an urban campaign, monsters might represent a minority of encounters. The characters must deal with NPC rivals and opponents, as well as political machinations, crime waves, natural disasters, and other hazards of city life. Monsters exist, certainly, but a wise group of urban adventurers must be prepared for a greater variety of challenges. Similarly, the Dungeon Master should be prepared to throw that variety of challenges at them. Urban Events Sometimes the biggest hassles of urban adventuring are not villains or monsters at all, but widespread events that turn the normal operation of the city on its ear. Any or all of these might serve as the basis for an adventure, or simply provide background ﬂ  avor and extra challenges in an otherwise unrelated tale. PCs might be caught up in these events, hired to provide security, or asked to aid in evacuation. Alternatively, they migh t sim ply want to contin ue what they w ere doing and protect their own interests, letting the situ-ation sort itself out.PLANNED EVENTS Observances, festivals, and other planned activities might impact the activities of at least a district, if not an entire city. The potential repercussions of such an event vary, but can include: barricaded roads, other roads and districts jammed with an abnormal number of people, closed shops and suspended services, and an increase in crime (pickpockets and cutpurses ﬁ  nd it easier to work in crowds). ARCANE TESTING A local arcane guild, wizard school, or similar insti- tution realizes that a particular magic experiment poses a potential danger to nearby citizens. Most organizations in a city try to avoid conducting experiments this hazardous, but magic is not always an exact science, and the danger can arise when it is too late to abort. In these instances, organizations might alert the city government to the anticipated time of the experiment’s completion, allowing ofﬁ  cials to evacuate nearby neighborhoods, or at least to post extra security and emergency personnel. 109Illus. by D.

Occasionally, however, a caravan of such large size arrives that it disrupts the functioning of all neighborhoods between the gate and the caravan district or the marketplace. MILITARY DRILL The local militia or city watch occasionally runs drills and practices maneuvers, to ensure readiness in the event of invasion, monster attacks, social uprisings, and other disasters. Sometimes the military closes down portions of the city for these drills; at other times, it conducts the exercises in the midst of the populace. PARADE OR NOBLE/ROYAL PROCESSION To celebrate a holiday or great victory, a coronation or a wedding—or simply to be seen by the populace—many nobles and royals take part in massive processions that wind through city streets. These might consist solely of the noble, his retinue, and his guards, or they might be much larger parades, replete with musicians, jugglers and other performers, and perhaps even animals. Although many citizens love the spectacle of a procession, it com-pletely disrupts business and daily life in those districts through which it passes. RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL, MAJOR A major religious festival is a citywide affair. Staged by a dominant church, or at least a large independent one, such a festival might involve religious proces-sions, people taking the day off work for prayer or ceremony, large feasts, long lines for access to priests or temples, and perhaps even demonstrations of faith and divine magic. A major religious festival can shut down an entire city for a day, if the church holding it is sufﬁ  ciently large. RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL, MINOR A minor festival might contain all the trappings of a major one, but it isn’t large enough to have a citywide impact. It might result in one or more districts shutting down, however. REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION In the wake of a disaster, city personnel and private workers move in to rebuild structures that have been damaged or destroyed. Even without a catastrophe Activity in the city grinds to a halt when the king makes an appearanceIllus. by M. Komarck 620_95386_Ch4.indd   110620_95386_Ch4.indd   110 8/22/06   9:29:59 AM8/22/06   9:29:59 AM111CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSto create the situation, roads need replacement cobble- stones, and buildings require upkeep and maintenance. A large repair crew might shut down an entire street or at least occupy enough space to impede both carriages and foot trafﬁ  c. SEASONAL BAZAAR OR FAIR When certain products come into season, or merchants receive a large shipment of specific goods, the result might be a fair. The marketplace is bedecked with color-ful decorations, and established merchants offer special deals to attract customers. Temporary vendors appear all over town, gathered into clusters of canvas lean-tos and small wooden booths that can cause massive traffic disruptions. Performers and street thieves alike flock to the area, taking advantage of the crowded conditions and inﬂ  ux of coin. SECULAR OR STATE HOLIDAY Minor secular holidays might simply result in shops closing as people take the day off to spend with their fami- lies. A major holiday, such as one that celebrates a great victory or the birth of a king, might include processions and festivals as large as those of major religious holidays, potentially shutting down the entire city. STRIKE OR DEMONSTRATION Guilds seeking better wages for their workers, or citizens concerned about particular governmental activities, might stage widespread demonstrations to make their point heard. Many evil and neutral governments do not permit such demonstrations, so these are possible only in certain cities. A planned demonstration has the tolerance, if not approval, of the city. Guards might be dispatched to provide security, ensuring that nei-ther the protesters nor the passersby get out of hand. At the least, a strike shuts down certain shops and industries. A sufficiently large demonstration could make doing business—or even walking—impossible in certain districts. DISASTERS AND UNPLANNED EVENTS Natural disasters. Riots. Invasions. Plague. These are the events that test a city and its citizens to their limits. Possible repercussions include all those discussed for planned events, plus mass evacuations, citizens being drafted into city or military service, widespread death and destruction, quarantine, martial law, and even the overthrow of the government. Even if one does not appear to cause drastic changes at ﬁ  rst, a disaster can have long-term economic impact as markets are disrupted or governments raise taxes to pay for repairs. In many cultures these disasters are viewed not as random chance but as signs of the gods’ displeasure. In the face of a particularly large disaster, this belief often turns either to despair, or to violence against one more groups of people whom the citizens believe have offended the gods. Some governments and churches deliberately point angry citizens toward scapegoats in order to take the pressure off their organizations. ARCANE DISASTER Not even the greatest arcanists can always predict when their magic might go awry. A golem could escape control, or an outsider free itself from a summoning circle. A magic item might be tainted, creating a curse that could impact the surrounding area. Whatever the case, arcane disasters can cause damage that is not only substantial but incredibly bizarre. Consider, for example, the repercussions of arcane pollution (see page 32) that affects everyone in a neighborhood with a baleful polymorph effect. DROUGHT, FAMINE, OR SHORTAGE A number of events, from an unusually hot summer or cold winter, to horriﬁ  c storms somewhere else on the continent, to war, can cause shortages. If the city runs low on important but nonvital goods—perhaps wood for new construction or metal for the creation of tools and weapons—the shortage results in an upsurge in prices, the closing of major shops or institutions, a rise in crime and unemployment, and demonstrations as citizens demand action from the government. A famine, drought, or other shortage in vital goods not only causes the above, but also causes evacuations and often erupts into riots and violence as citizens, driven by fear and desperation, battle one another over the few remaining supplies. Drought and famine also lead to widespread death, not only from hunger and thirst, but also disease. EARTHQUAKE A small earthquake might cause nothing but property damage and some minor injuries, while a large one can level buildings and reduce entire districts to rubble, killing hundreds or thousands. Shortages and disease often follow in the wake of an earthquake, as does economic hardship when some vendors close down while others raise prices. Sewage systems cease functioning as their passages collapse. An earthquake might release monsters into the city or reveal new dungeons beneath it. FIRE As with earthquakes, ﬁ  res can be anything from local- ized disasters to widespread catastrophes that raze e n t i r e  d i s t ri c t s .  F i r e  i s  a  p a rt i c u l a r  d a n g e r  i n  p o o r e r 620_95386_Ch4.indd   111620_95386_Ch4.indd   111 8/22/06   9:30:10 AM8/22/06   9:30:10 AM112 CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERS cities or neighborhoods, where almost everything is built of wood. Some cities boast not only wells and ﬁ  re brigades but also magical means of reining in a ﬁ  re that has spread out of control, but many others cannot afford such protections. INFESTATION Something like an invasion (see below), an infestation in this context refers to the sudden arrival of a nonhumanoid threat. It might represent an abnormal number of rats pouring up from the sewers or the sudden appearance of a ﬂ ock of gargoyles in the embassy district. An infestation frequently leads to combat, as the city guard or hired adventurers are dispatched to eliminate the problem. Before this occurs, however, the infestation causes panic, evacuations, and potentially the closing of shops as people refuse to leave their locked homes. INVASION Invasion is one of the greatest fears of many city dwell-ers. Cities build defensive walls and devise emergency escape and supply routes for use in case of an invasion, and some even arrange for magical protection. Invaders could take the form of a foreign army, a horde of orcs, or the soldiers of the king seeking to regain control of a city that has gotten out of control. Invasions often lead to many other problems: shortages, as the enemy cuts off the city from its supplies; ﬁ  re, as the invaders lob burning arrows or pitch over the walls; and plague, as the dead rot in the streets. An enemy army with monstrous allies might launch both an invasion and an infestation at the same time. PLAGUE Plague is particularly common in poor cities, but it poses a threat everywhere. Cities without sewer sys-tems (or with poor or dilapidated ones) expose their citizens to filth fever and other foul diseases. In the most impoverished districts of some cities, corpses are left to rot for hours or days before they are collected for burial. Plague is less of a threat in most D\u0026D cities than it might have been historically, due to the ability of clerics and other classes to cure it, but an epidemic that spreads quickly might grow beyond the ability of the churches to contain it. Plagues inevitably cause panic, closures, and violence as people struggle for supplies or attempt to rid themselves of those whom they believe are spreading the pestilence. RIOT A riot involves a large number of people who have turned to violence. It could be random violence, directed against anyone and anything in the rioters’ path, or it might be focused on a particular target, as the people attempt to overthrow a leader or lynch a prisoner. A riot is not considered a crowd of individuals, for game purposes, When an invasion strikes, the day-to-day aggravations of urban life suddenly don’t seem so badIllus. by W. Mahy 620_95386_Ch4.indd   112620_95386_Ch4.indd   112 8/22/06   9:30:14 AM8/22/06   9:30:14 AM113CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSbut rather as a number of mobs (see page 124). While it is possible to talk down a group of people who are working t h e m s e l v e s  u p  t o  a  f r e n z i e d  s t a t e ,  b y  t h e  tim e  t h e y’ v e reached the point of actually rioting, it’s all but impossible to reason with them without the use of magic. Talking rioters into dispersing once they have reached the point of violence is essentially an epic-level task, ﬁ  rst requiring that the rioters are able to hear you—something nigh impossible without the use of magic. Then you must succeed on a Diplomacy or Intimidate check (DC 40 + the number of mobs that make up the riot). A successful check causes one of the component mobs to disperse, plus one component mob for every 5 points by which you beat the DC. Most riots consist of two to four component mobs, but a citywide riot might consist of dozens. A riot causes immense property damage as people smash windows, throw rocks, and otherwise vent their frustration on anything they can reach. Individuals might be swept up into the riot and either join it, adding to its numbers, or ﬁ  nd themselves assaulted and beaten. Many city guards, knowing full well how dangerous riots can be, do not hesitate to use lethal force, and rioting is a capital offense in some cities. STORM/FLOOD A mighty storm is a great threat in a coastal or low-lying area, but an event to be feared anywhere. It can damage buildings and wash away entire neighborhoods. At the very least, a ﬂ  ood shuts down speciﬁ  c districts, making them impassible on foot and closing—if not damaging or destroying—all businesses located there. Spreading a warning about an oncoming storm or flood causes crowded streets and evacuations, supply shortages as people stock up, and even violence or riots if supplies run low. This is still preferable to ﬂ  ash ﬂ  oods, however, which can completely overwhelm a low-lying district in a matter of minutes. STRIKE OR DEMONSTRATION, UNPLANNED Not all strikes or demonstrations are cleared with the city ahead of time. In fact, in most cities, they often are not. This could be because the government frowns on or even forbids such demonstrations, or because the workers or guilds involved do not trust the city to let them move forward. An unplanned demonstration clogs up traffic and shuts down shops along its route, and frequently results in conflict with local law enforcement. Most demonstrations break up at this point, but if tempers are riding high, they sometimes degenerate into riots. Demonstrations, planned and unplanned, sometimes spark counterdemonstrations by citizens on the other side of an issue. Should these two forces clash, an escalation into violence is likely.NPC Encounters The majority of encounters in a city-based game are likely with NPCs, as opposed to blatantly monstrous foes. While the best NPCs—villains, allies, and the like—are tailor-made speciﬁ  cally for the campaign, it can be difﬁ  cult to have premade characters ready for any and all occasions. Presented below are statistics blocks for characters whom PCs are likely to encounter in a city, from guards to robbers, nobles to shopkeepers. Following those are four high-level villains easily who can be easily worked into a D\u0026D city; you can use them as written, or tweak the details provided to generate foes more suited to your campaign. Finally, this section provides statistics for urban mobs.

Remove Quick Draw. VILLAINS It’s always more memorable to pit the group against a recurring villain, with goals and a personality, than for them to face “nameless opponent number 47.” Presented here are four mid- to high-level villains, ready for inser-tion into almost any campaign. CLYRRIK THE HALT The tale of Clyrrik the Halt is the sad story of a dream destroyed. Before he became the infamous head-hunter he is today, Clyrrik was an honorable, if not particularly prosperous, tradesman. The city’s bustling merchant quarter allowed even nonhumans to ply their wares and trades in the open, and Clyrrik’s humble storefront was a testament to the freedom of the human-dominated marketplace. At least, it was for a time. When Clyrrik’s talent and dedication as a weapon-smith began to bear fruit, he fast became the talk of the quarter (at least among those who paid attention to weapons and weapon-makers, which was almost everybody). His facility with worked stone and metal far outstripped that of any local human weaponsmith, and his near tireless commitment to his work resulted in long hours at the forge, which resulted in turn in his being able to produce more than other operations of equivalent size. In spite of (or perhaps because of) refusing to undercut the other merchants on price, his little business boomed, and before long he was the pride of the city’s small but active dwarf community. Clyrrik was far from the ﬁ  rst dwarf skilled with hammer and anvil to ever set up shop, but something about his work stood out, and people came from all over the city to see it. The rise of a humble entrepreneur from among the ranks of the dwarf community was precisely what many in the human-dominated Merchants Guild needed to ﬁ nally make their move. Clyrrik became the rallying cry for locals (predominantly humans) who thought that the immigrant races had long been stealing jobs and revenue from the human community. Within a few weeks, motions were passed, steps were taken, and new laws and taxes were put into effect, the upshot of which was the strangling of all nonhuman commerce in the quarter. And when the dwarves rallied around their local hero, as the humans knew they would, the result was a cruel backlash, during which several dwarves lost their lives and dozens more their homes and jobs. Cyrrik’s establishment was burned to the ground, his entire stock either melted or stolen. For the remaining dwarves, there was no recourse but to accept the role into which they had been pressed. They had tried, and they had failed. Justice had failed. After he had lost all there was to lose, Clyrrik disap- peared. Many believed he packed up shop and left the city in pursuit of more hospitable climes elsewhere. And in time, he and the events surrounding his life were forgotten by all but a few. In truth, Clyrrik never left the city that had betrayed him so thoroughly. Indeed, he dove even deeper in, moving through the darkest places of the city, hiding his identity—and his rage—beneath a hood and, eventually, a reputa- tion. Today Clyrrik, known as a “halt” (a cold-hearted bounty hunter), is one of the most feared figures in the city. He specializes in taking money from humans to track down (and often kill) other humans. If he is specifically instructed to bring his target back alive, he consents, but should his quarry make so much as one false move on the return journey, Clyrrik returns with only the severed head. The few humans who have survived being hunted down by Clyrrik flatly refuse to speak of the experience. Clyrrik the Halt is fairly unassuming, even for a dwarf. He stands just over four feet tall, and despite weighing well over 200 pounds, appears neither obese nor overly muscular. The best word to describe his build is dense, since he is the perfect combination of muscle, tone, and 620_95386_Ch4.indd   118620_95386_Ch4.indd   118 8/22/06   9:30:44 AM8/22/06   9:30:44 AM119CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSsize for his frame. Although he endeavors to ensure that it’s rarely seen with any clarity, his face is beaten and weathered, and in sufficient light reveals a weari- ness many would find surprising. He keeps his mop of wiry hair—russet brown, but beginning to fade to gray—beneath his cloak’s hood, but not tied back. Clyrrik prefers it to fall around his face, thereby concealing his features even more.

She is one of the worst of all creatures: a cruel, malicious bully with the strength and skill to back up her bravado. She is also a vicious racist. She despises all races other than humans, and the fact that she herself is only half human is a source of deep, burning shame. Doucral occasionally makes snide comments and self-effacing jokes about her half-blood nature, but woe betide anyone else who makes similar comments, since there is no faster way to send Doucral into a shrieking, bloody rage. Doucral currently rules the Trap-door Spiders, a gang of sneak-thieves, muggers, and muscle-for-hire. When not out on a paid job, Doucral and her cronies roam the streets of the poor districts, looking for victims to shake down and sometimes to kill. She is almost certain to target any nonhu- man adventurers she sees, a fact that could easily bring her into conflict with the PCs. Despite her arrogance and average intelligence, however, Doucral possesses great cunning, and she is not above arranging ambushes or framing people she dislikes for crimes that she herself has committed. Doucral of the Web is an enormous ﬁ  gure, standing almost 6-1/2 feet tall and weighing upward of 300 pounds. Her face and arms are corded with old scars, and her teeth are ﬁ  lthy and broken. Her skin looks tan; only close inspection reveals a faint tinge of orc-gray. Her hair is a shock of bright red, which she keeps tied back and preens over like a debutante.

Utilizing spells such as undetectable align- ment and extended nondetection —both of which he casts on himself daily—he has managed to masquer- ade as a priest of Pelor, the neutral good god of the sun. He has spent years rising through the ranks of the church hierarchy, and today he is one of the high priests of Pelor’s church, boasting as much authority as any city official. In truth, Darius is a devoted follower of the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu, Prince of Deceit. He secretly presides over a demonic cult consisting of merchants and govern- ment officials. Through a combination of deceit and corruption, they work their way through all echelons of city power, striving toward the day when Darius can consecrate the entire community to his fiendish lord, ruling like a despot over a population enslaved by their own vice and greed. Physically, Darius is a man of middle years. His dark hair is beginning to gray, and his eyes are kindly. He wears a neatly trimmed beard and normally dresses in the robes of a priest of Pelor. He seems genial and kind-hearted, always asking what he can do to help his neighbors. In truth, Darius considers all living beings beneath him, thinking of them as vermin. In Darius’s mind, only Fraz-Urb’luu himself is a superior being.

He currently has summon monster VI (already cast) set to trigger if an attacker reduces him to 50% of his hit points. Planar Cohort  Darius can call an outsider to serve as his cohort; DMG  197. Darius’s planar cohort is Malerna, a succubus. In public, she masquerades as a teenage orphan whom Darius has taken under his wing. Darius uses her to seduce and spy on political rivals or members of the com- munity whom he thinks would make useful additions to his cult. THE SYMBOL Only the most ignorant or newly arrived resident fails to shudder at the mere mention of this, the city’s greatest nemesis. What began as a series of isolated incidents has grown into a dark age, the grip of which has held fast the nightmares of city resi- dents for years on end. At the center of this web of rumors and fear sits an enigmatic figure known only as the Symbol. So named for the inscru-table signs left at the site of various crimes, and more recently, at the close of dread- ful letters found by city ofﬁ cials, the Symbol is a threat to every living being who calls the city home. Nobody knows what the Symbol wants, or what he or she (or possibly it) truly is. They only know what the Symbol means to them and their city: death. The few who agreed to track the being down have all come back dead— but mobile. In every case, their rotting corpses, often without a visible trace of physical harm, shambled mindlessly back to the city. Once inside, they would return to their own homes, where they would casually murder their own children, one by one; then, with the deed done, they would col-lapse to the ﬂ  oor in a heap, truly dead for once and for all. Needless to say, few locals are willing to seek out the Symbol anymore. The truth behind the horror is almost as tragic as the horror itself. The entity calling itself the Symbol is a human being, or at least used to be. Decades ago, its mother was one of the city’s wealthy elite, born into fortune and favored by providence. One thoughtless evening’s dalliance with a handsome stranger, however, threatened to ruin the family name, because it result- ed in a most unexpected pregnancy. The noblewoman contrived to keep the baby, by means of passing it off as her husband’s child, but when the infant was born with no sex organs and with eyes that were neither her own nor her husband’s, she knew the plan would fail. The only way out was to smother the child and report the “stillbirth” to her husband and to society. But though she knew this to be the proper course of action, she could not bring herself to do it, and so she chose to flee the city with her newborn child cradled to her bosom. On their way to a new life, the fleeing duo’s carriage was attacked by a raiding party led by two bicker- ing ettins. Everyone but the child was killed in the attack, and when the ettins couldn’t agree on what should be done with the infant, they trundled off, leaving it in the arms of its dead mother. Soon after, a tribe of orcs came upon the scene and brought the infant to their witch doctor. He immediately proclaimed the freakish babe a “gift” from the gods, and then branded the symbol of their tribe—an an- cient orc pictogram denoting the concept of the birth–death– rebirth cycle—onto the screaming child’s forehead. Today, nothing but rot- ting corpses remains of the tribe within which the devil-child was raised. The baby’s freakish lineage surfaced more and more with age, and it grew stronger by the day. By age 13, the child was leading the tribe; by age 19, half the tribe was dead, but no less under the child’s command for it. In the present day, the adult that was once a careless noblewoman’s last mistake is a true force of nature, pos- sessed of arcane secrets most unnatural and a veritable The Symbol and “Mother”Illus. by J.

It is said that no human has ever seen the true face of the Symbol and lived to tell of it. When it is seen at all, which is an occurrence rare in the extreme, the Symbol’s tall frame appears covered from the neck down in a suit of form-ﬁ  tting black leather engraved with numerous unidentiﬁ  able sigils, icons, and other eldritch charac- ters. Its face is obscured by a thick white hood, which is attached to a white cape that trails from the shoulders to just above the ankles. The bottom of the cape ﬂ  utters gently, irrespective of the presence or absence of any prevailing wind. One gloved hand holds a rune-covered longsword with a blade of blackest steel.

When manifested, “Mother” is susceptible to attacks separate from its host. Roleplaying Hook  The Symbol believes its ghostly visage familiar to be the remnants of its mother’s tortured spirit. MOBS Mobs are large groups of people, bound together by anger, fear, and the desire to do violence. The mob mentality overrides normal behaviors, moral strictures, and even alignments of those who compose it. In most instances, a mob might have a particular target or subject that has aroused their anger, but anyone or anything who gets in their way is subject to attack. A mob is treated as a single entity, much like a swarm, but is composed of Small, Medium, or Large creatures. A mob must be composed of creatures of the same type, and a riot that consists of creatures of different types is best modeled as two (or more) separate mobs forming a single encounter. A mob can be an extremely difﬁ  cult challenge, not merely because it is dangerous, but because it is often made up of innocent people. Some are swept away by violent emotions, but some might have legitimate griev-ances; others might actually be mystically compelled to action (this is particularly true of a throng of children). PCs should attempt to find some means other than violence—or at least other than lethal violence—for dispersing at least some mobs. Reducing a mob to 0 hit points causes it to break up and disperse, leaving some members of it dead or injured; see below. A mob consists of 48 Small or Medium creatures, or 12 Large creatures. Larger groups are represented by multiple mobs. Most mobs are transient, lasting for at most 1d4+1 hours before dispersing. Presented below are mobs appropriate to an urban setting.

In order to attack, a mob moves into an opponent’s space, provoking an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature, since it tramples over and moves around its victim. A mob can move through squares occupied by enemies, and vice versa, without impediment, although it provokes attacks of opportunity if it does so. A mob can move through openings large enough for its component creatures. A mob deals 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no attack roll needed. Mob attacks ignore concealment and cover. Damage reduction applies to mob attacks. Expert Grappler (Ex)  A mob can maintain a grapple without penalty and still make attacks against other targets (nor- mally, attacking other targets while grappling imposes a –20 penalty on grapple checks). A mob is never considered ﬂ at-footed while grappling. Trample (Ex)  A mob that simply moves over a creature and doesn’t end its movement with that creature in one of its occupied squares can trample the creature. A trampled creature takes damage equal to 2d6 points +1-1/2 times the mob’s Strength modifier. The victim can either make an attack of opportunity against the mob or attempt a Reflex save (DC 25 + the mob’s Str modifier) to take half damage. Mob Anatomy (Ex)  A mob has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks. A mob cannot be ﬂ  anked, tripped, grappled, or bull rushed. Unlike standard swarms, mobs are made up of rela- tively small numbers of individual creatures, so spells or effects that target speciﬁ  c numbers of creatures can have an effect on a mob.

A mob that gains negative levels equal to its Hit Dice breaks up as if reduced to 0 hit points. Negative levels gained in this manner are not the result of negative energy (and thus cannot be blocked by death ward  or removed by restoration ), but never result in permanent level loss. A mob takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and evocation spells. Although mobs are treated as one creature, it sometimes becomes necessary to determine the fate of a specific individual caught up in the mob. If a mob is dispersed by nonlethal attacks, there are no casualties. If a mob is dispersed by lethal attacks, assume that 30% of its number are slain and 30% are reduced to 0 hit points. To determine a speciﬁ  c individual’s fate, simply roll d%: a result of 01–30 indicates death, 31–60 indicates the victim is reduced to 0 hit points, and a roll of 61–100 indicates the victim escapes relatively unscathed.

(For instance, increase Dexterity by 2 and lower Constitution by 2 for elves.) Recalculate Armor Class, hit points, saving throws, and skills, but not damage rolls. Mobs cannot have an Intel-ligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score higher than 10; if racial modiﬁ  ers would raise these abilities higher than 10, ignore them, but apply negative modiﬁ  ers as normal.

Were- rats lurk at the heart of thieves guilds, and vampires stalk lone travelers in the night. Gargoyles perch atop towers, while otyughs bathe in wretched sewage.

This does not qualify as a standard ranged attack, but instead uses the rules for siege engines (DMG  99). The golem must succeed on a roll of 1d20 + its base attack bonus (usually 12) against DC 15. The boulder has a range increment of 200 feet, and range penalties apply as normal. If the roll succeeds, the boulder hits the targeted square, dealing damage to all creatures or objects in that square (Reﬂ ex DC 15 half). If the roll fails, determine the direction of the miss as described on DMG  100. It takes the golem two move actions to reload the cata- pult from a store of boulders it keeps slung to its underside, so it can ﬁ  re every round if it does nothing else, or less frequently if it moves or takes other actions. The average siege golem carries 3d4 boulders. Immunity to Magic (Ex)  A siege golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A warp wood  or wood shape  spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds. A repel wood  spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage. A phase door  spell cast directly on a siege golem negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1d3 rounds. The golem gets no saving throw against any of these effects.

The pack is actually a handful of barghests, led by the especially cunning greater barghest that found a planar portal and led his pack through it. 3 Parts of the old city have been crumbling with increasing frequency, causing extensive damage and even several crushing deaths. The structural problems are the result of a lone destrachan that has made its way topside through a cistern. 4 A lockdown has been placed on the nonhumans quarter following several reports of an elf attacking wealthy human nobles. The “elf” in question is actually a drow in face paint, recently arrived through a forgotten passage to the Underdark. 5 During a misguided alchemical experiment, a wizard ac- cidentally unleashes a voluminous gout of arcane pollution, resulting in one of the decorative gargoyle statues atop his tower coming to life and ﬂ  ying off into the city. 6 A lone grimlock, outcast by his tribe for his kindly nature, masquerades as a leper in the poorest district. One night he witnesses a terrible murder, but, because he is blind, he cannot even provide an anonymous description to the authorities. Who will help? 7 After local shepherds report the mauling of several sheep, the wounds made by the claws and beak of some enor- mous bird, word begins to spread of the presence of a roc. In truth, the culprit is an angry owlbear that lost its mate to hunters. 8 The opening of a new well inside the city walls has resulted in the arrival of a displaced phantom fungus which begins to hunt for prey in the area around the well. And because the fungus is invisible, the body count—and the panic—is rising. 9 A rust monster has escaped from an arcane research facil- ity and is cutting a swath through the local munitions store. The brave soldiers of the watch categorically refuse to go anywhere near either the site or the monster. 10 An ancient treant has awakened from a long slumber to find its sacred grove reduced to a small park inside a large city. Can its frustration and rage be assuaged before it awakens the other trees and begins to take revenge on the city? 620_95386_Ch4.indd   126620_95386_Ch4.indd   126 8/22/06   9:31:29 AM8/22/06   9:31:29 AM127CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERS Siege golems are enormous machines of war. Although certainly capable of posing a threat to a group of adventur- ers, they are designed for laying siege to entire cities. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Siege golems are most frequently used as one element of a larger military force. They might be deployed in groups, and are often accompanied by other creatures that defend them from attack, allowing them to focus on the wall.  As with all golems, siege golems are mindless, and follow the orders of their creators in the most straightforward manner possible. SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS Siege golems are most effective when paired with other forces, but the expense involved in creat- ing one means they often work alone. Individual (EL 12):  A lone siege golem might be intended to terrorize a small city, or it might be waiting while a larger force is assembled. EL 12: A single siege golem ap- pears during the night and lobs bo ul d e rs a t th e ci ty w alls. E v e n if adventurers from the city can stop it, they are left wondering who sent it, and why. Could it have been a diversion from something worse? Military Assault (EL 14–16): Siege golems are often deployed in groups, the better to break down a defender’s walls more swiftly. EL 15:  A trio of siege golems march in advance of an undead horde (treat as a separate encounter), and focus their attacks on one particular section of the wall. Battle Group (EL 11–20):  One or more siege golems might be accompanied by other creatures—perhaps giants, or other golems—intended to protect anyone from interfering with the siege golem’s operation, and perhaps to assist it in demolishing a city’s defenses. EL 16: A pair of siege golems are surrounded by a crew of eight stone giants. So long as nobody draws near, the stone giants hurl boulders to enhance the effectiveness of the golems’ attacks on the walls, but they move to intercept anyone who approaches the golems. ECOLOGY Siege golems have no biological needs.",

They carry their ammunition slung beneath them or in a special compartment built into their structure. ADVANCED SIEGE GOLEMS In some instances, a military power might wish larger and more powerful golems for its forces. A siege golem up to 30 Hit Dice remains Gargantuan, while a siege golem of 31 to 49 Hit Dice becomes Colossal. If the golem increases in size, its boulder advances to 6d8 base damage. SIEGE GOLEMS IN EBERRON Siege golems were created during the Last War by House Cannith. They never saw as much use or popularity as the warforged, but they did turn the tide of several sieges. Today, they exist in the armies of all of the Five Kingdoms, but are rarely used. Because they are so blatantly offensive in nature—serving little, if any, defensive purpose—each side fears that mobilizing them might inspire a preemp-tive strike by a neighbor. SIEGE GOLEMS IN FAERÛN Siege golems are relatively recent creations of the Red Wizards. Thay has sold only a few of these devices, but their customers include Cormyr and Zhentil Keep. FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS A siege golem’s body must be crafted from enormous amounts of high-quality hardwoods, with iron joints and leather ﬁ  ttings, costing a total of 3,000 gp. The catapult requires masterwork craftsmanship. The body must then be engraved with mystical sigils, and treated with rare tinctures worth another 3,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 15 Craft (carpentry) check. CL 14th; Craft Construct, geas/quest, fabricate, limited wish,  caster must be at least 14th level; Price 100,000 gp; Cost 56,000 gp + 4,000 XP.

Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage, and the opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless they succeed on DC 21 Reﬂ  ex saves. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a cesspit ooze also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reﬂ ex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The ooze’s acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. Constrict (Ex)  A cesspit ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check. The opponent’s clothing and armor take a –4 penalty on Reﬂ  ex saves against the acid. Death Burst (Ex)  When a cesspit ooze is slain, it bursts in a spray of viscous acids. All creatures within a 30-foot radius are dealt 4d6 points of acid damage, and are sub- ject to the ooze’s enrage ability even if they have already successfully saved against it. A DC 21 Reflex save halves the damage and avoids the enrage effect completely. The save DC is Constitution-based. Even those who fail are still entitled to the standard DC 15 Will save to avoid being enraged. Enrage (Su) Anyone who takes acid damage from a cesspit ooze must attempt a DC 15 Will save. Failure indicates that they have absorbed some of the rage and torment that powers the creature. In 1d20 rounds (determined secretly by the DM), the individual ﬂ  ies into a homicidal rage. This functions like the barbarian’s rage class feature, with a few exceptions. The individual cannot choose whom to attack, or to stop attacking. He must attack the nearest living creature (other than the ooze itself), and continue to move on to target after target. After a number of rounds equal to one-half the ooze’s Hit Dice (usually 5), the subject is entitled to a new Will save, and can continue to save every 5 rounds until he successfully shakes off the effect. A creature who successfully saves is immune to the enrage ability of that particular cesspit ooze for 24 hours (except if exposed to its death burst, described above). Improved Grab (Ex)  To use this ability, a cesspit ooze must hit an opponent of up to Large size with a slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a cesspit ooze. Instead the creature splits into two identical oozes, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A cesspit ooze with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. Stench (Ex) Due to its nature as a creature of refuse, a cesspit ooze emits a horriﬁ  c odor. All living creatures within 30 feet 620_95386_Ch4.indd   128620_95386_Ch4.indd   128 8/22/06   9:31:40 AM8/22/06   9:31:40 AM129CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSof a cesspit ooze must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same ooze’s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison  or neutralize poison  spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaf- fected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Vulnerable to Positive Energy (Ex) Although it is not undead, a cesspit ooze is empowered by the pain and agony of those who died nearby. As such, it shares some vulnerabilities with the undead. It takes damage from positive energy, as if it were undead, and a successful turn or rebuke undead attempt imposes two negative levels for a number of rounds equal to the cleric’s turning damage minus the ooze’s Hit Dice. Skills Cesspit oozes have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. They have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. They can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. They can use the run action while swimming, provided they swim in a straight line. *A cesspit ooze in a sewer, drainage ditch, or other gar- bage- or refuse-ﬁ  lled environment gains a +8 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. The cesspit ooze is a product of the urban environment, a horrific predator born of the distinctive mixture of pain and despair found in the poorest quarters of the city combined with the ambient arcane energies that emanate from the most magic-intensive regions. They are most common in large cities and are usually found where impoverished neighborhoods abut districts containing arcane colleges or laboratories. Unlike most oozes, cesspit oozes possess a level of intelligence that, while less than that of the average human, allows them a fierce cunning and rudimentary grasp of hunting and ambush tactics. Despite this fact, their minds are so alien that they retain their relatives’ immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities and similar forces. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Cesspit oozes are ambush hunters. They never move far from their point of origin, and they gain sustenance from the sense of fear and desperation around them as much as from the ﬂ  esh of those they consume, so they are always found in particularly impoverished areas. This allows them to take prey that is not likely to be missed, an added beneﬁ  t of their hunting technique. Where possible the cesspit ooze strikes from concealment, often attempting to drag a single person out of sight before others even realize the creature is present. SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS Cesspit oozes are solitary hunters, but the combination of forces and circumstances that birth them sometimes result in multiple specimens appearing in a given locale. Individual (EL 9): A lone cesspit ooze lurks in a dark (and likely unpleasant) environment, waiting for prey to happen by. It might well be responsible for an entire rash of disappearances. EL 9:  A cesspit ooze has developed right at the border between a poor district and an area with several magical laboratories. It is feeding primarily on those traveling between districts, and the poor of the city are beginning to blame the recent rash of disappearances on the wizards, an attitude that could erupt into civil unrest.  Cluster (EL 11–12): In a few instances—perhaps a mass death or just a simple coincidence over time—a group of two to three oozes might develop in the same location. Cesspit oozes neither battle one another nor deliberately collaborate, but the fact that several are active in one area could make them appear to be working together, and can lead to people encountering them in numbers. EL 12:  A family of three starved to death together, huddled in the meager shelter of an open sewer grating. Their deaths, combined with the arcane runoff from a nearby arcanists guild, resulted in the spawning of three complete oozes. They have been feeding not merely on passing people, but on beasts of burden such as horses and oxen as well. ECOLOGY Cesspit oozes lurk in sewers, dark alleyways, drainage ditches, garbage heaps—anywhere they can blend in with humanoid-produced waste and refuse. While they are known to consume various urban animals, such as rats pqs CESSPIT OOZE LORE Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can learn more about cesspit oozes. When a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the informa- tion from lower DCs. In cities where the oozes are relatively common, a Knowledge (local) check suffices as well, but the DC increases by 5. Knowledge (Arcana) DC Result21  Cesspit oozes are sentient oozes that feed on both the flesh and the fear of other beings. They emit a foul stench, and their touch is acidic. 26  Those struck by a cesspit ooze seem to absorb some of the fear and pain that animates them, causing them to ﬂ  y into a murderous and uncontrollable rage. Like some other types of ooze, they split when struck by certain sorts of weapons. 31  The cesspit ooze splits when struck with a slashing or piercing weapon, and explodes when finally slain. They form when sentient creatures die and decompose in sewage or humanoid refuse tainted by ambient magics. pqs 620_95386_Ch4.indd   129620_95386_Ch4.indd   129 8/22/06   9:31:44 AM8/22/06   9:31:44 AM130 CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSand dogs, they gain little if any sustenance from them; the odd physiology of the ooze requires sentient prey. The cesspit ooze is not born in any traditional sense of the word. They are formed when a sentient creature dies in an environment filled with humanoid refuse and filth, surrounded by the misery of others, and tinged with effects such as arcane pollution (see page 32). As the corpse slowly dissolves into the slime, it absorbs both the magic and the ambient despair of the hungry and frightened. The result is an intel-ligent ooze that feeds on both the flesh and the pain of sentient beings and, while not undead, shares a few traits in common with such creatures. Oddly enough, nobody slain by a cesspit ooze ever spawns the creation of another one, even if all factors and circumstances are appropriate. Sages theorize that the emotion absorbed by the ooze prevents the dead body from “powering” a new one. While the ooze possesses an intelligence that it appar- ently “inherits” from the decaying body, it in no way contains any remnants of that personality. The cesspit ooze is a brand new creature, completely alien in thought and unable even to comprehend anything recognizable as a language. Environment:  Any urban, particularly impoverished districts with nearby magic.

It is essentially chaotic evil by nature and instinct, simply incapable of even comprehending morality—let alone altering its behavior and alignment accordingly. TYPICAL TREASURE Cesspit oozes do not collect treasure or understand the concept of value. Any treasures that might be found nearby are simply the possessions of its victims, left to rot in the sewage or refuse. These items rarely represent more than 1/10th the normal amount for an encounter of the ooze’s Challenge Rating, and consist almost exclusively of coins and mundane items. CESSPIT OOZES IN EBERRON Because so many of the major cities of Khorvaire make use of ubiquitous (if low-powered) magic, and in the shadow of the recent Last War, these oozes are unfortunately common. From Sharn to Passage, Korth to Rhuukan Draal, these oozes slither through the various sewer systems and under-levels, feeding on the destitute of numerous cultures. CESSPIT OOZES IN FAERÛN The cesspit ooze seems, in some respects, to be the gods’ vengeance on Thay for their amoral use of magic.

Anyone within 60 feet of the ripper who fails a DC 16 Will save takes a –4 penalty to Wisdom. This aura is a constant effect, which the ripper cannot suppress. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by a disorienting aura from the same ripper for 24 hours, but is still susceptible to its other pheromones. Other rippers are immune to this effect. This is a mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Pheromone Burst (Ex)  Once every 1d4 rounds, a ripper can release a burst of pheromones as a standard action. Anyone in range must succeed on a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by that precise pheromone from the same ripper for 24 hours, but is still susceptible to its other pheromones.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Rippers prefer ambush techniques, making use of their chameleon ability and their climb speed to close on unsuspecting prey. They are prepared to ﬁ  ght for their meals when necessary, however, or to cause others to wreak havoc for them. They never hunt during the day, and they are canny enough to avoid well patrolled or protected areas. They normally use their pheromone bursts in self-defense, or to soften up large groups of prey.

ECOLOGY Rippers can survive on animals for a short time, but something in their physiology craves the flesh of sentient beings. Whether this is a true biological need or merely an issue of taste is unclear. Although generally human- oid in shape, and able to appear ﬂ eshy from a distance, rippers are anything but human. Their limbs are abnormally long and strangely joint- ed, bending in alien ways. They boast a hard, insect-like chitin. Rippers have no true heads, though a bulge at the top of their carapace mimics the humanoid head. Their “mouths” are long vertical slits that open roughly where the hu- man sternum would be. Their fingers and toes are clawed, serving as both excellent climbing tools and weapons. Rippers are born in clutches of thick, mucus- covered eggs, not unlike certain insects. The larvae feed on one another, until only one—or at most, a small clutch— survives. They reach adult size in mere months, and live for roughly 15 to 20 years. Rippers do not mate directly with one another. Rather, in roughly eight- year cycles, females release a clutch of eggs into some dark area. This process also emits a pheromone, which attracts the males to fertilize the eggs. Few individuals have been able to obtain a clear view of living rippers; the combination of their chameleon abilities and the disorientation that blurs the senses of anyone who draws near them conspire to keep many of their details hidden.",

Unlike other undead whom it resembles, such as the lich, the sepulchral thief does not deliberately seek out an undead existence. Rather, like some ghosts or ghouls, it rises spontaneously on rare occasions when the proper circumstances align. First, an evil-aligned and malicious thief must die in the midst of planning or executing the greatest theft (or similar criminal activity) of his career, an endeavor in which he has devoted his greatest efforts and on which he has staked his future. Perhaps he is slain by a terrible trap, or by a guard or rival thief. He must die in both anger and frustration, within reach of his goal, or even having just managed to acquire it. “Sepulchral thief” is a template that can be added to any humanoid creature of 5 HD or more (referred t o  h e r e a f t e r  a s  t h e  b a s e  c r e a t u r e ) ,  p r o v i d e d  i t  i s  o f  chaotic neutral or any evil alignment, and possesses the appropriate ability and skill requirements.

        "description":  "A sepulchral thief retains all the base creature’s special attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 thief’s HD + thief’s Cha modiﬁ  er unless otherwise noted. Draining Touch (Su):  Any time the sepulchral thief deals damage with its touch attack, it gains a number of hit points equal to 1/4 the damage dealt (for this reason, the creature often attempts to begin combat with a sneak attack delivered with this method). If this raises its hit point total above its normal maximum, it gains the excess as temporary hit points that disappear after 1 hour. It can never have more temporary hit points than its total normal hit points. Obscuring Aura (Su):  Sepulchral thieves are shrouded in a mind- and senses-clouding aura of negative energy. Living creatures in a 30-foot radius must succeed on a Will save or be affected by the aura. Creatures with fewer than one-half the sepulchral thief’s Hit Dice are blinded and deafened. For example, if the sepulchral thief has 9 HD, this applies to creatures of 4 HD or fewer. All other creatures take a –2 penalty on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same thief’s aura for 24 hours. Sneak Attack (Ex): The sepulchral thief deals 1d6 points of extra damage when ﬂ  anking an opponent or at any time when a target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet ( PH 50). If the creature already has sneak-attack bonuses due to class levels or some other source, these bonus dice stack. Special Qualities:  A sepulchral thief retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described below. Turn Resistance (Ex):  A sepulchral thief has turn resistance +4.  Damage Reduction (Su):  A sepulchral thief’s undead body is powered by hatred and negative energies, giving the creature damage reduction 15/magic and either good or lawful (regardless of the thief’s actual alignment). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): A sepulchral thief with at least 14 ranks in Hide can use the Hide skill even while being observed, as long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, as per the assassin class feature ( DMG  181). Immunities (Ex):  Sepulchral thieves have immunity to cold, electricity, and mind-affecting attacks. Reanimation (Su):  The greed and malevolence that ani- mate the sepulchral thief cannot be dispersed through mere physical destruction. When a sepulchral thief is destroyed, its life force immediately inhabits the single most valuable item it has on its possession (often but not always a weapon). Unless the item is destroyed or mysti-cally cleansed, the sepulchral thief reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death. Casting dispel evil  or hallow  on the item destroys the thief’s essence if the caster makes a successful caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the sepulchral thief’s HD. Destroying the item also destroys the inhabiting essence. If the thief has two or more items of equal value as its “most valuable” possessions, it inhabits a weapon in favor of any other item; otherwise, choose randomly. So long as the sepulchral thief inhabits an item, that item radiates moderate necromancy and evil, in addition to its normal auras. See in Darkness (Sp):  Moreso even than other undead, the sepulchral thief is fully comfortable in the black of night. They can see perfectly in darkness—retaining the ability to distinguish color and texture—to a distance of 60 feet. This applies even to magical darkness. Shadow Jump (Sp):  A sepulchral thief gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door  spell, just as a shadow dancer can ( DMG  195). The thief can jump a total of 30 feet each day in this manner. If the sepulchral thief has the shadow jump ability from some other source, such as levels in the shadow dancer prestige class, these total daily distances stack. Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Dex +4, Int +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a sepulchral thief has no Constitution score. Skills:  Sepulchral thieves have a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, Hide, Move Silently, and Sleight of Hand checks. Otherwise same as the base creature. Challenge Rating:  Same as the base creature +2. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Although a sepulchral thief enjoys causing pain and suffering, it prefers to do so as the result of its thefts, rather than through direct physical assault. Still, it is ready and willing to slay anyone in its way, or anyone who angers it. It prefers to attack from surprise, making use of its sneak attack (and perhaps draining touch) abilities. Under most circumstances, a sepulchral thief prefers to save its shadow jump ability for last-minute escapes, but it might use it to enter a particularly well guarded area or to obtain a tactical advantage in battle. Because they are frequently of high intelligence, sepul- chral thieves are fully capable of focusing their efforts on their most dangerous foes. When faced with a choice of targets, the thief often attempts to slaughter spellcasters ﬁ rst, then melee ﬁ  ghters. Their malice-driven nature makes them prone to holding grudges, and a sepulchral thief might take months or even years planning vengeance on one who thwarted it. SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS Sepulchral thieves are far too selﬁ  sh and hate-ﬁ  lled to develop long-term companionships or alliances. On a 620_95386_Ch4.indd   134620_95386_Ch4.indd   134 8/22/06   9:32:10 AM8/22/06   9:32:10 AM135CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSsporadic basis, however, a sepulchral thief might be will- ing to work for, or alongside, other criminals or creatures (of course, at the end of the endeavor, the creature is just as likely to betray its ally as it is to follow through on whatever deal was arranged). Individual (EL varies):  Sepulchral thieves are most often found working alone. EL 12: A 10th-level sepulchral thief has learned of the accomplishments of a number of local heroes—including the PCs. It has set out to strip them, slowly and methodi- cally, of both their treasured possessions and their reputations. Crew (EL varies): On the rare occasions they do work with others, sepulchral thieves ally with other criminals (par- ticularly organized groups such as guilds), the bet- ter to gain access to information and resources they might not otherwise have. EL 13:  An up- and-coming guild has allied with a sepulchral thief in the hopes of destroying a rival organization that is both a criminal guild and a priest-hood of a dark and illicit god. The un- dead creature hopes to use the opportu-nity to throw the city into chaos by turning the law, the church, and the guild against one another in open conﬂ  ict. For the time being, the sepulchral thief (the same 10th-level rogue described above) leads a team consisting of four 5th-level rogues. ECOLOGY Only the greediest and most vile of criminals have a chance of rising as a sepulchral thief, even under the proper circumstances, but when they do, they become undead beings of nigh-unstoppable cunning and ability. Sepulchral thieves are scheming and clever, always plan- ning their next acquisition. They are driven by a lusty greed more overpowering than that of any mortal. Like dragons and other monsters, they seek to hoard items of great value, from gold to artwork to items of potent magic. Sepulchral thieves make use of what items they can, but the others simply sit in hidden stockpiles, for it is not the expenditure of wealth that these undead love, but the act of stealing it—and, more important, the suffering such loss causes its original owner. Cru-elty as much as greed motivates the sepulchral thief; it seeks out not only items of great monetary value, but great personal value. It desires the last handful of coins owned by a poor family as much as it does the most fabu- lous masterpiece in a lord’s manor. The acquisition of wealth and valuables is of primary concern, but if the sepulchral thief can harm its victims in the process—causing a family to starve for want of coin, abscond- ing with the holy icon that might end a war between nations, or re- moving the only cure for a plague spreading across a village—so much the better.",

        "description":  " Any. Sepulchral thieves almost invari- ably dwell in urban regions, where both wealth and victims are plentiful, but they occasionally beleaguer smaller communities or seek out powerful magics and great riches in dungeons. Typical Physical Char- acteristics:  Sepulchral thieves look like their original race, but gaunt and desiccated. Their ﬂ esh hardens, almost like a mummy’s, and darkens into shades of gray or dirty white. Their ﬂ  esh frequently tears sufﬁ ciently to expose bits of bone, and their eyes disap- pear into dark and empty sockets. SOCIETY Sepulchral thieves are parasites in humanoid communi- ties, having no society of their own. They view others of their kind as potential rivals; alliances between sepul-chral thieves are almost unheard of, and even those that do exist are short-lived and invariably end in betrayal. Sepulchral thiefIllus. by Daarken 620_95386_Ch4.indd   135620_95386_Ch4.indd   135 8/22/06   9:32:14 AM8/22/06   9:32:14 AM136 CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSBecause they still retain intelligence and memories from their past lives, sepulchral thieves are most comfortable in cities that resemble their former homes. Alignment:  The malice and lawlessness inherent to the sepulchral thief makes every last one of them either neutral evil or chaotic evil. A base creature that was lawful evil becomes neutral evil; one that was chaotic neutral becomes chaotic evil; those that were neutral evil or chaotic evil retain that alignment. Although they are sentient, a sepulchral thief literally cannot change to any alignment other than these two, though shifting between the two is possible. TYPICAL TREASURE Sepulchral thieves hoard treasure they cannot use, but attempt to equip themselves with the best and most useful items they can. A sepulchral thief carries standard equipment for its CR, but always has one or more hidden stashes of treasure containing that same amount over again. Thus, when faced in their lair (a rare occurrence), such a creature has double normal goods, but when faced elsewhere has only the normal amount.ADVANCED SEPULCHRAL THIEVES All sepulchral thieves advance using class levels. Rogue is by far the most common class, but a sepulchral thief with levels in bard, ﬁ  ghter, ranger, assassin, and shadow- dancer are not uncommon. A sepulchral thief retains its favored class from when it was alive, but considers rogue a favored class as well. Level Adjustment: As base creature +6. SEPULCHRAL THIEVES IN EBERRON Sepulchral thieves appear most frequently in cities where the Dragonmarked Houses have a great presence. While some argue that this is merely logical—the more economically powerful a city, the more likely it has great wonders to steal and a thriving criminal element—others suggest a more sinister connection. These theories range from a curse on the Houses to the influence of demonic forces from Khyber. These creatures appear more frequently in Karrnath than any other nation, and are practically nonexistent in Thrane, most likely due to the frequent use of negative energy in the one, and of positive energy in the other. SEPULCHRAL THIEVES IN FAERÛN In Faerûn, these creatures are the creations of Mask, the Trickster and the Thief of the gods. Sepulchral thieves do not necessarily serve Mask, nor do all of them even wor- ship him (though many do). It seems, as with so much else he does, that the dark god created these creatures either as part of some intricate scheme that has yet to fully reveal itself, or simply as a dark and malicious whim.

When a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the informa- tion from lower DCs. Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (local) checks cannot reveal the nature of these creatures, but they might reveal the names of local criminals rumored to be undead or monstrous. Knowledge (Religion) DC Result15  On very rare occasions, a villainous and obsessed thief might return from the dead to continue his larcenous ways. 20  Called “sepulchral thieves,” these undead felons are somewhat resistant to the power of clerics and to mundane weapons. They radiate an aura that dulls the senses, and their touch can drain the life from a victim. 25  A sepulchral thief steals not merely objects, but life, gaining health even as it injures others. It seeks to steal objects with personal as well as monetary value, and enjoys causing pain and suffering in the process. Only weapons of goodness or law are effective against them. 30  A sepulchral thief can travel through shadows, disappearing from one spot to reappear in another, and can see perfectly well in any darkness. 35  Even when slain, a sepulchral thief might not be gone, as they can inhabit the magic items they possess, returning days later much as a lich with a phylactery. Only destroying the item is certain to eliminate the creature, though dispel evil  and hallow often suffice. pqs 620_95386_Ch4.indd   136620_95386_Ch4.indd   136 8/22/06   9:32:22 AM8/22/06   9:32:22 AM137CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERSSkills  Balance +10, Climb +8, Listen +8, Spot +8 Wind Vulnerability (Ex)  Because some of a pest swarm’s constituent creatures can ﬂ  y, high winds can break up the swarm. Wind effects deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage to a swarm per spell level (or Hit Dice of the originating creature). A pest swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and it doesn’t re-form until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage. Unlike swarms composed entirely of ﬂ  ying crea- tures, a pest swarm can’t be blown away by high winds. Distraction (Ex) Fortitude DC 16, nauseated 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.Wounding (Ex)  Any living creature damaged by a pest swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter at the beginning of the pest swarm’s turn. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic. Skills  A pest swarm has a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. (Some individual animals within the swarm can ﬂ  y, but they stay close to the landbound animals so the swarm stays cohesive.) It can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. A pest swarm uses its Dexterity modiﬁ  er instead of its Strength modiﬁ  er for Climb checks. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsSWARM RULES Why a swarm? It’s a lot easier to treat a collection of hundreds of animals and vermin as a single creature with one Armor Class, hit point total, and so on. For convenience, the information on the swarm subtype from the Monster Manual is reprinted here. Swarm Subtype: A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modi-fier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm attempts saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonfly-ing creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponent’s space, which provokes at-tacks of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without im- pediment, although the swarm provokes attacks of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures. A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. (A pest swarm of 1,200 creatures is composed of four pest swarms, each one oc-cupying a 10-foot square.) The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares. Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent. A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as dis- integrate), with the exception of mind-affecting spells and abili-ties (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.  Swarms that contain flying creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures (see Winds, DMG 95). For example, a pest swarm (considerd to be composed of Tiny creatures) can be blown away by a severe wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to a swarm per spell level (or Hit Dice of the originating creature, in the case of effects such as an air elemental’s whirlwind). A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage. Swarm Attack: Creatures that have the swarm subtype don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm’s statistics block has “swarm” in the Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below. Swarm HD Swarm Base Damage 1–5 1d6 6–10 2d6 11–15 3d6 16–20 4d6 21 or more 5d6 A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s descrip- tion states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other kinds of attacks in addition to normal damage. Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below. Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nause- ated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm’s HD + swarm’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm’s description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration check. 620_95386_Ch4.indd   137620_95386_Ch4.indd   137 8/22/06   9:32:26 AM8/22/06   9:32:26 AM138 CHAPTER 4 EVENTS AND ENCOUNTERS The pest swarm is a horde of the city’s unwanted denizens: stray dogs, feral cats, rats, and bugs of every kind. When clustered together, they wreak havoc with thousands of miniscule claws and bites. Pests rarely congregate into swarms like the one described above. The summon pest swarm  spell (found on page 67) creates a sufﬁ  cient accumulation of cats, dogs, rats, and insects to be considered a swarm. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Pest swarms created by the summon pest swarm  spell move at the direction of the spellcaster. Those rare examples of pest swarms not created by magic move randomly across the city until dispersed. ECOLOGY In theory, a pest swarm could form in any location that has a large population of its constituent creatures, such as a forest. However, in a natural environment of that sort, the conditions that would prompt a swarm to gather—in particular, a shortage of easily available food—do not come into play.  Environment:  Pest swarms are found only in cities, being composed of creatures native to that environment.",

Additionally, the descendants of the people or creatures who once ruled the land have recently reappeared, and are threatening violence. 10. The city was the site of a civil, racial, or religious war. Effect on City:  Members of the losing faction are perse- cuted and harassed to this day. Plot Hook:  The government or dominant church is growing tyrannical in its persecution of innocents who happen to belong to the hated faction. Alternatively, members of that faction are advocating violent overthrow of the government or dominant church. 620_95386_Ch5.indd   144620_95386_Ch5.indd   144 8/22/06   9:49:33 AM8/22/06   9:49:33 AM145CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYTHE URBAN CRAWL In many ways, the city is itself a dungeon. There might be no ceiling above a rogue’s head as he wends his way through a maze of alleys, but that doesn’t mean his path is clear. And anyone who thinks that traps aren’t a concern in the city unless you’re in someone’s home has obvi-ously never been set up by a trio of scam artists or lured into an ambush by a city-dwelling monster. Even those who’ve lived in a big city all their lives can still ﬁ  nd new and dangerous things to learn about their urban home, making it the ideal site for a life of adventure. Big-city life, known here as “the urban crawl,” offers everything an adventurer could ask for (or ask to be spared from): activity, employment, entertainment, death, politics, taxes, and more. Much attention has been paid in Cityscape  to the establishment, development, and manipu- lation of power groups, primarily through the system of houses, guilds, and organizations, and the integration of contacts therein. Later in this chapter, we go Beyond the Dungeon (see page 152) and take a look at how to tell certain types of ongoing stories. Before all that, however, we’ll discuss some of the meat of the urban crawl. City life differs from rural and monas- tic life in a number of ways, and those differences merit examination. From taxes to race relations to discussion of speciﬁ  c city sites, the information presented in this section gives DMs a solid baseline from which to develop three-dimensional cities and city-based sagas. The ﬁ  rst way in which the urban crawl differs from lif e in other en vironments is the sort of random chal- lenges one might encounter while simply making their way around the city. The following table should serve as an example of how a random encounter table might look when geared speciﬁ  cally to an urban environment. Details, of course, should differ from city to city, depend- ing on variables such as climate and location. URBAN CRAWL FEATURES Adventuring within a city is itself a challenge. Typical city features that could pose obstacles to characters adventuring in a city include city walls, building walls and roofs, gates and doors, narrow streets, and dark alleys. The following provides a summary of typical city features.",

        "description":  "A standard element of city-based adventures is the chase over the rooftops. Getting to a roof usually requires climbing a wall (and making Climb checks), unless the character can reach a roof by jumping down from a higher window, balcony, or bridge. Flat roofs are Oh, rats . . .Illus. by H. Lyon 620_95386_Ch5.indd   146620_95386_Ch5.indd   146 8/22/06   9:49:40 AM8/22/06   9:49:40 AM147CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYcommon only in warm climates (piled snow can cause a ﬂ  at roof to collapse), but are always easy to run across. Moving along the peak of a roof requires a successful DC 20 Balance check. Moving on an angled roof surface without changing altitude (moving parallel to the peak) requires a Balance check at a DC of at least 15, possibly higher depending on the conditions. Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10 Balance check.  A crisis point in a rooftop chase often arises at a dead- end, when the person being chased ends up on a roof with no escape, requiring a long jump across to the next roof or down to the ground. The distance to the next closest roof is usually 1d3×5 feet horizontally, but a higher roof than the one a character is on is much more difﬁ  cult to jump to. Use the guidelines on page 77 of the Player’s Handbook —a horizontal jump’s peak is one-fourth of the horizontal distance—to determine whether a character can make a jump. Example: Rhaud the rogue is ﬂ  eeing his pursuer across the rooftops. He reaches a dead end, and the nearest roof is 8 feet across an alley—and 4 feet above. He needs a Jump check good enough to clear 16 feet (or four times the rise in height). Lighting : If a city has main thoroughfares, most will be lined with lanterns hanging at a height of 7 feet from building awnings. These lanterns are spaced 60 feet apart, so their illumination is all but continuous. Secondary streets and alleys are rarely lit; it is common for citizens to hire lantern-bearers when business calls them out after dark. Alleys can be dark places even in daylight, thanks to the shadows of the tall buildings that surround them. A dark alley in daylight is never dark enough to afford true concealment, but it can lend a +1, +2, or +3 circumstance bonus on Hide checks, depending on the speciﬁ  c conditions. TA XES It’s been said that nothing is certain but death and taxes, and nowhere is that truer than in the largest urban centers. The specific amount might vary, but in most cities, only the exceedingly rich and the completely destitute get out of paying taxes of some variety or other; in some areas, even the latter receive no exemption. In times of peace, the tax rate in most civilized areas ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent, though this range can exist within the same tax year, since not everyone pays the same percentage of tax. In times of war, or among harsher governments, the tax rate can rise as high as 50 percent. Generally speaking, taxes are broken up into national and local taxes, and the responsibility for collecting both is typically left to the city (if a settlement is large enough to be a city, it’s large enough to process its own taxes and deliver them to the government). If the city is beholden to no higher government, as is the case with city-states, the city still collects taxes for both, but typically leaves the distinction between the two invisible. All the people need to know is that some of their taxes go to national efforts, and the rest to the city. Similar to taxes, tithes are dues paid out to an organized body, in this case a temple or church. Unlike taxes, which the government actively collects, tithes are generally offered freely, a sign of support on behalf of the faithful. Of course, the spirit of tithing is occasionally betrayed by the letter of implementation, and in areas where a particular faith dominates (especially an evil-aligned or law-obsessed sect), tithes can be expected or even demanded. In cities where the power center is heavily inﬂ  uenced or controlled by the church, and particularly in theocracies, tithes are often included in the secular taxation process, creating in effect a system of set-asides whereby taxpayer monies can be funneled to religious groups and programs. In most cities, though, tithes are as they’ve always been—voluntary offerings from churchgoers. Tithes are usually requested on an annual basis, and typically amount to one-tenth of a member’s annual earnings (after taxes). Most faiths make special excep- tions to this for adventurers. Due to the relationship of an adventuring member (and his allies) with his church, most faiths request that adventurers tithe 10 percent of their earnings from an adventure as soon as it concludes. Not only does this expedited tithing system prevent mas- sive amounts of gold from burning holes in the pocket of the faithful (many of whom aren’t used to seeing thousands of gold pieces in the same place), but it also acts to keep money in the regions in which it is found. If an adventurer is going to loot an area for all its worth, the least he can do is leave some gold behind at the local church. Needless to say, local secular governments tend to appreciate this practice a great deal. RACE RELA TIONS The deﬁ  nitions in the Dungeon Master’s Guide  that deﬁ ne the amount of racial mixture in a city—isolated, mixed, or integrated—present the percentages but not the whole story. An important question is how the races relate to each other, and particularly how the members of the dominant race (generally the largest group) relate to the other races in the city. The district types (see Chapter 1), by including dwarf, elf, gnome, and halﬂ  ing neighborhoods, assume a fairly integrated society, in which members of all the races retain their own customs while being equal citizens of the city. The goblinoid ghetto district could follow the same model, or—true to its name—it could imply a situation where the goblinoids are an isolated and somewhat persecuted minority within the city. Consider the following models when deﬁ  ning the roles of the races in your city and their relations. 620_95386_Ch5.indd   147620_95386_Ch5.indd   147 8/22/06   9:49:48 AM8/22/06   9:49:48 AM148 CHAPTER 5 RUNNING",

        "description":  "Located on a quiet lane in the poorest district, the Grace of Goddess Minis- try has stood since the city was young, weathering storm, ﬁ re, and invasion for decade upon decade. In fact, the ministry is so old that it has even outlived its patron deity, whose worship was strong when the city was founded, but fell out of favor during an ancient war and has stayed out of favor ever since. Today, the ministry’s function is more civic than religious, and the remaining religious element has been speciﬁ  cally nondenominational for decades now—a fact which angers more than a few of the city’s religious elite. Over the years, some have been so irked that they’ve tried to suffocate the ministry into closure, but every attempt has failed miserably, leading many to believe that the ministry has a wealthy benefactor who prefers to remain anonymous. Since the ministry’s workers refuse to comment, the topic remains an item of gossip on the street. The ministry’s doors are open 24 hours a day to souls in need, and many of the city’s poor would have died long ago were it not for the noble efforts of Mother Antigona (LG female dwarf cleric 7) and her nursemaids, as well as the brave women who came before them.  Manley and Son:  When Utaref Manley (CG male human expert 9) came to the city from the lands to the north, he came with nothing but a hammer and the clothes on his back. He even had to rely on another b l a c k s m i t h ’ s  c h a r i t y  t o  g a i n  a c c e s s  t o  a n  a n v i l  ( t o  s a y  nothing of a proper forge) until he’d earned enough to make his own way. But make his way he did, eventually opening his own smithy operation. He considered his life blessed even before the beautiful elf woman came into his shop not long after, so when she bore him a son two years later, he wondered which god of his pantheon he had pleased in a former life. Sadly, some other people in the neighborhood viewed the fruit of their union as “an abomination in the eyes of god,” and several of them tried to tar and feather the boy on his way home from school one day. His mother tried to intervene and, in a freak accident, was struck in the head with a rock and died. Although Utaref expected he would not outlive his elf bride, he did his best to raise their child—Erik Utarefson (CG male half-elf expert 4)—by himself, and when Erik came into his own as a blacksmith, he was added to the legend hanging outside his father’s business. Odds and Endings: This pleasant storefront, located in the Merchants Quarter, is one of the most popular shops in the city, at least among the working class. Originally, the store was home to the combined ofﬁ  ces of a bookbinder/collector and a scribe who went into busi- ness together as “Atherton-Smyde” (after the surnames of the two proprietors). After a rather explosive and public falling out, the scribe moved uptown to open his own store (see The Poison Pen, below), and Atherton-Smyde was closed for business. But though its doors stayed locked and its windows boarded up, the building was never demolished and no one new ever moved in; for almost a year, it just sat. When it finally reopened for business, it did so under the name “Odds and Endings,” a store specializing in providing “hard-to-ﬁ  nd solutions for everyday problems.” Its proprietor, Fenley Atherton (LN male human expert 7/wizard 3), had liquidated his interest in Atherton-Smyde in order to build inventory for this new endeavor, and the move paid off. From the moment its doors opened, Odds and Endings has been a ﬁ xture of the community. The working class can ﬁ  nd almost anything it needs, from inexpensive but top qual- ity tools and rare medicinal herbs to minor magic items, all at substantially reduced costs. The Pickled Pepper:  When the passingly famous but undeniably indefatigable Marvis Hopps (CN male halﬂ  ing bard 11) ﬁ  nally retired from a life of bar- and plane-hopping, swashbuckling and wench-pinching, he did what he always said he would: He took his earnings from his last adventure (he was never one for saving) and opened a bawdy tavern in his favorite city. Hopps’ retirement dream might not be located in the fanciest part of town, but the nightlife can’t be beat. Folks come from all over the city to partake of both the many different kinds of ale—some of which, Illus. by M.

It is said that as long as an act can make Marvis smile, he’ll give it a chance on his stage (though poorly received entertainers tend to regret ever stepping foot thereon, after the merciless ribbing of Hopps and the other patrons). And if one catches him on a somewhat quieter night, he just might regale them with stories of his adventures alongside the notorious Quip of Sigil, the last (reluctant) scion of an infernal throne. The Poison Pen:  Originally in business with F enley Atherton, Luthaby Smyde (LE male human expert 3/wizard 7) took his interest in their business and opened a new store in the Nobles Quarter called the Poison Pen. The storefront legend says the shop is a place where one can purchase books and scribing supplies, as well as hire the services of the resident scribe-in-residence. In truth, the store is primarily a facade that allows Smyde the opportunity to service high-end clientèle in the realm of scroll-based magic. He sells scrolls of rare and dangerous spells at an increased markup and even provides scrolls that are themselves deadly weapons (cursed parchments, scrolls that explode when opened, and so on) on a case-by- case basis. He deals primarily with the rich and corrupt and is not above silencing a former customer, should such measures be necessary. As a shop owner, he’s neither patient nor understanding (by a far stretch), but he knows better than to make a mess where he eats. As a result, customers can expect not to be harmed in any real way while in his shop, but are well-advised to watch their purse strings.",

        "description":  "When the esteemed naturalist and druid activist Imoian Mellari disappeared from the city without a trace, operation of his business affairs fell to his only living relative, his grand-niece, Mara (NG female human commoner 1/wizard 3). Problem was, Mara had long since committed herself to the study of the arcane, and didn’t know much about the natural world, certainly not enough to run a store whose primary purpose was to provide answers about such topics. But when she took over the store, she found that her grand-uncle had cunningly hidden much of his knowledge among old store records and had further chronicled many of his personal thoughts and experiences in a set of hide-bound journals he hid in the attic. As much to protect the trove of information as to continue her grand-uncle’s legacy, Mara committed herself to running the store, and has grown increasingly intrigued by it ever since. A series of bizarre incidents, including the death and spontaneous reanimation into undeath of her familiar—a ﬁ  eld mouse named George—has led her to question just what her grand-uncle really did with his life, and what really hap-pened the night of his disappearance. R.J. Weatherford Memorial Hall:  Erected on the site of the former town hall, this new town hall features a hand-carved atrium and an elaborate sandstone plaque memorializing R.J. Weatherford, perhaps the most popular mayor in the city’s history. When the former building burned down on the anniversary of Weatherford’s death, the city council took it as a sign that the blackened founda- tion should be razed, and a brand-new building dedicated to Weatherford erected in its place. The active mayor at the time made some noises about threatening to veto the proposition, but allowed the motion to pass at the last minute, surprising many of his constituents in the process. Those close to the situation whisper of rumors that the mayor’s daughter’s stage-coach was set ablaze the night before he was to veto the construction. BEYOND THE DUNGEON As previously mentioned, the urban campaign is very well suited to traditional adventures, but it also lends itself to stories and plots that go beyond crawls and delves. These sorts of adventures can be tricky to run, particularly if the DM is unaccustomed to doing so. As promised, then, the following sections contain advice and suggestions for running other sorts of urban adventures. CRIME SPREES Even the most powerful villain is beatable when the PCs know without a doubt that he is the foe. But what happens when the perpetrators are multitudinous and largely uncon- nected? What if  the true foe is a trend or prevailing attitude in the city at large? Catching a clever serial killer might be difﬁ cult (see Mysteries, below), but at least the problem is solved when he’s ﬁ  nally brought to justice. With crime sprees, the PCs can quickly come to feel as if they’re drown- ing in problems. The DM won’t want his players feeling as though there’s nothing they can do but grind through each petty criminal, one at a time, in a vain attempt to stem the tide of a larger social calamity. As such, the best bet is to establish a root cause for the crime spree—a person or event to which the bulk of the recent rash of crimes can be traced. If a particular event is to blame, such as the imprisonment of a local crime boss or the assassination of the local sheriff, then the ultimate solution to the problem should lie in rectifying the event in question. If the crime spree began after the jailing of an inﬂ  uen- tial criminal ﬁ  gure, the PCs might be put in the intriguing position of having to negotiate with him through the bars of his prison cell. Crime sprees of any length or “efﬁ ciency” are usually the result of coordinated efforts, and it could fall to the PCs to determine who is leading the criminal charge in the boss’ absence. If the spree is bad enough, and the local law enforcement clearly in over their heads, the PCs might have to do the crime lord a favor of some kind, in exchange for his promise to rein in his thugs and return some law and order to the beleaguered 620_95386_Ch5.indd   152620_95386_Ch5.indd   152 8/22/06   9:50:15 AM8/22/06   9:50:15 AM153CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYcity. Since this is ultimately just a patch (and doesn’t feel particularly heroic in any event), the PCs will still be faced with the root of the problem: a crime lord rules the city, not the local ofﬁ  cials. Some root events just can’t be rectiﬁ  ed. If the cause of the current crime spree was the death of a local leader, whether criminal or otherwise, then nothing short of the resurrection  of that leader will constitute a true rectiﬁ  cation (and even if some local high priest was willing to do such a thing, it would again be just a patch, not a solution to the real problem). Trickier still, what if the root cause turns out to be the passing of a new tariff on a particular set of goods or services? In these situations, the PCs will likely have to resort to putting away their swords and spells and pulling out their thinking caps. Finding a good solution to a complex problem means doing some homework and asking some tough questions. Are the crimes the result of resentment among the poor, or are they the handiwork of a network of career criminals? And if the latter is true, are they doing so under someone’s orders, or speciﬁ  cally because nobody is left to rein them in? Only by ﬁ  nding the answers to the tough questions can the PCs arrive at a solution. GUILD/ORGANIZATION CONFLICT Given their importance within and inﬂ  uence on the urban landscape, it is inevitable that the city’s various power groups will come into conﬂ  ict sooner or later. If the DM decides to focus some or all of his city-based campaign on such conﬂ  ict, two questions must be answered before he even thinks about putting pen to paper. The ﬁ  rst question is, “What is the scope of the conﬂ  ict?” Even if the DM opts to restrict himself to the options provided in Chapter Three, that still provides him with nearly two dozen different groups (and even that’s only painting in the broadest of strokes). Does he intend to plunge the city into an all-out guild war, with each guild working actively and aggressively to dismantle the infrastructure of the others? If so, he again needs to ﬁ nd a root cause. More often than not, the most effective approach is to just pick two guilds or organizations in particular, and make the decision to set the two at odds with one another. This is easiest to do with predominantly evil or criminal groups, such as the slavers guild and the thieves guild, who usually don’t need much of a reason to engage in protracted conﬂ  ict with other organizations. Just as simple and effec- tive, however, is the advancement of hostilities between two existing rival organizations. Since many organizations revolve around a particular agenda or ideology—especially political and religious groups—it’s usually just a simple matter of coming up with an incident or event from which the new spate of hostilities can stem. It’s important to remember that part of deﬁ  ning scope is setting the parameters of the conﬂ  ict. Once the groups and the causes of the conﬂ  ict have been established, the DM needs to determine just how those parties are con-ﬂ ictin g. Do th ey strik e at o n e anoth e r sociall y , at high society events and the like, in an attempt to weaken their opponents’ credibility or image? Or are their salvos more directly political in nature, with each group attempting to secure the support of local political ﬁ  gures, or even other prominent organizations, in its bid for supremacy? If the DM decides that the conﬂ  icting parties have fallen to violence, he must decide when and why the conﬂ  ict turned bloody, as well as what sort of shape that violence takes. Do the rivals send assassins to one another’s homes, or are large-scale battles taking place in the streets in broad daylight? The DM needn’t establish every single detail ahead of time, but knowing how things came to be is instrumental in telling the story. The second and perhaps most important question the DM needs to answer before embarking on a campaign or campaign arc of this nature is how to get the PCs involved. Even if the PCs are good-aligned defenders of the city, the matter of how they come to know and become involved with a particular conﬂ  ict will color the scope and tone of their involvement. If the DM is using the systems outlined in this book as the model for his urban campaign, it is highly likely that the PCs will belong to at least one house, guild, or organization themselves, or at a bare minimum, will at least have contacts within similar groups. If this is the case, how will the PCs feel about a conﬂ  ict between the two (or more) groups in question? If one of the characters is a member of one of the conﬂ  icting groups, it creates a seamless way to get the group involved but invites a host of new questions—some of which might prove challenging to answer. And if the DM wants to really shake things up, he can establish a conﬂ  ict between groups who each have representation within the player characters, thus forcing the characters to work out the conﬂ  ict among themselves before attempting to address it in their respective groups at large. MYSTERIES Urban settings make perfect backdrops to mysteries and investigation-based adventures. Some unknown killer might be stalking the slums, continually thwarting the efforts of the city watch to catch him. Valuables vanish from magically protected safes. People commit crimes totally out of character for them, and have no memory of doing so. Someone is collecting damaging information on all the political ﬁ  gures of the city, blackmailing them into passing certain laws. A ghost haunts the embassy district, and all efforts at destroying it have failed; someone must learn what drives it, and help it resolve those issues. All the people have simply disappeared from a particular house or neighborhood. A mysterious smell is permeat- ing the temple quarter, making people ill, and no source 620_95386_Ch5.indd   153620_95386_Ch5.indd   153 8/22/06   9:50:20 AM8/22/06   9:50:20 AM154 CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYcan be found. Any of these situations, and many more, require an intrepid and clever group of heroes to track down and eliminate the problem. When the DM sets out to run a mystery, ﬁ  rst he must decide is who the perpetrator is, and why. In an urban campaign, this involves an extra step: deciding if the mystery leads to someone the PCs already know, have dealt with, or at least heard of. Following a train of clues t o  s o m e b o d y  i n  t h e  c i t y  g o v -ernment, or someone the PCs thought they could trust, has much more of an im- pact than discovering some person they’ve nev- er met. On the other hand, not every  mys- t e r y  c a n  l e a d  b a c k  t o someone they know, and sometimes involv- ing an established NPC in a mystery would dramatically change the political or social makeup of the city. If the individual behind a mystery is a charac-ter you’ve created for that particular adven-ture, try to arrange for the PCs to meet, or at least hear of, that individ- ual before they discover he is the culprit. Mix in his introduction with those of other, unrelated characters—“red herrings,” as it were—to keep the play-ers thinking. D o n ’ t  b e  a f r a i d  t o  i n - troduce a large number o f  c l u e s ;  i t ’ s  a l w a y s  b e t t e r to include too many than too few. This rubs some Dungeon Masters the wrong way. Why would a master spy allow a guard to catch a whiff of a cologne distinctive to his cul-ture, and let himself be overheard speaking to his secret contact, and leave bribe money and a map of the palace in his room where a search by investigators will ﬁ  nd it? All of these point to the ambassador as the spy, but he’s supposed to be an expert! One such mistake is possible, if not likely, but all three? The DM must remember, however, that his players cannot see the big picture as he can. They might not ﬁ nd all those clues, or they might fail to recognize their signiﬁ  cance. If they ﬁ  nd one clue, and follow it to the culprit, they need never know that three or four other clues existed. On the other hand, if the DM provides only one clue and the players miss it, the entire adventure could stall. S imilar l y ,  a  p uzzl e  th a t’ s  t oo  e asy  is  be tt e r  th an  o n e  that’s too hard. If the PCs track down the leader of the political conspiracy too swiftly, the DM can always make the next one tougher. If they cannot seem to ad- vance no matter how hard they try, perhaps because they’ve missed clues or simply because they aren’t think- ing along the same lines as the DM, they might grow frus- trated. Better to keep the game moving, and allow the players their sense of accomplishment. POLITICAL EPICS Few story arcs are as re-warding as those with outcomes that have the potential to shape the v e r y  c o u r s e  o f  h i s t o r y . In some fantasy cam- paigns, this grandeur of scope often mani- fests itself in stories of epic significance to the setting—what is commonly known as the “save the world” plot. While these sorts of stories can certainly take place in a city-based campaign, the urban environment pro- vides an opportunity to explore the notion in a more familiar, and usually more engaging, manner. Con- sider a typical story of this sort: An evil wizard has discovered an artifact capable of awakening a ﬁ  endish wyrm from a millennium of slumber. When the wizard threatens to unleash his demonic dragon upon an unsuspecting city, and it falls to the PCs to thwart him, a “save the world” plot has emerged. If the characters aren’t successful, the wizard and his new ally will most assuredly destroy the city, and aren’t likely to stop there, either. This is an ex-ample of how a typical epic-scale plot still works in the urban environment. Now consider a plot that accomplishes the same end result, but which can only be told effectively within When investigating a mystery, keep your guard up— the villain might just be someone you trustIllus. by C. Frank 620_95386_Ch5.indd   154620_95386_Ch5.indd   154 8/22/06   9:50:24 AM8/22/06   9:50:24 AM155CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYthe conﬁ  nes of a city-based campaign: The city and its people are on the brink of war with a neighboring kingdom which has a long history of resolving disputes through use of force. The city’s ruler is exhausting every avenue available in his search for a diplomatic solution. Meanwhile, a conspiracy is afoot to tip the delicate balance and, in so doing, to bring war and ruin to the city. The cabal of conspirators—an organization which has been operating in secret since the time of the last war—is almost exclusively to blame for the increase in hostilities. The current government would have little difﬁ  culty stabilizing relations with its warlike neighbors, were it not for the corrupting inﬂ  uence of this organization and its functionaries. When the PCs learn of the conspiracy, they are plunged into an epic, “save the city” plot. With no real proof, the authorities are powerless to take advantage of the knowledge; the PCs must act, or the city will undoubtedly be attacked, and in all likelihood blasted largely to ruin. In this type of story, the characters can combine diplomacy and combat with a race against time to win the day. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about these types of epic stories is that they can lead to further stories without diminishing their own impact. In the previous example, failure to expose the cabal of conspirators in time means that war and death are deﬁ  nitely coming to town, and nothing anyone can do will stop it. But unlike explosions of mighty artifacts or swaths of draconic destruction, stories of war are horriﬁ  c without being hopeless and sudden. To wit, let us now discuss. . . . WAR Few events drive or change an urban campaign as thoroughly as war. Running wartime adventures in the city provides for all manner of new and interesting challenges. Active Involvement When most people think of war in D\u0026D, they see active combat and sieges. This is the more overtly dramatic option, and it lends itself to all sorts of adventures. Hold the Wall: Perhaps the most obvious adventure during city warfare is to hold the wall against siege. Invad- ing armies might use hordes of foot soldiers, enormous engines of war, constructs such as siege golems (page 126), ﬂ ying assailants, barrages of spells, or any combination thereof. The PCs must ﬁ  nd a means of countering all these methods with the aid of the city’s many defenders. Sure, a good solid wall likely holds against orcs on ladders, assuming a sufﬁ  cient number of defending soldiers, but how to prevent a dragon from ﬂ  ying overhead and straﬁ  ng the lord’s keep? How does one prevent a team of sappers, led by a druid with move earth , from tunneling under the defenses? While a siege might seem to be nothing but straightforward combat, it involves tactics, strategy, and investigation as well, as players attempt to anticipate their attackers and ﬁ  nd means of heading them off.",

        "description":  "Rather than defend the city, the PCs might simply try to locate a certain individual, object, or group, and smuggle them out before the invaders ﬁ  nd them. Perhaps the capital is only days from falling, and the group must spirit away the last true heir to the throne before she is killed by usurpers. The undead armies of the necromancer Balakur might be seeking the Pristine Goblet of Pelor, which they can use in a foul ritual to render themselves immune to positive energy, and the PCs have to ensure the goblet isn’t present when the city surrenders. Or their concerns might be more personal, as they strive to remove their families from harm’s way. A search-and- rescue story involves combat against the invaders, sneaking through the front lines, or perhaps even avoiding press gangs who are forcing anyone who can wield a sword to stand on the walls in a hopeless last-ditch defense. Escape: Rather than spiriting someone or something else out from the invaders’ path, the PCs might simply wish to get themselves out of the city before the hammer falls. This involves the same sort of combination of stealth and combat as a search and rescue, but the PCs need not worry about escorting others.  Hiding and Resistance:  Rather than ﬁ  ght on the wall, PCs who see the battle as going poorly might choose to go to ground. They hide out until they can drum up a resistance movement against the invaders, launching raids and waging an urban war. It’s possible to achieve a quick victory in this fashion, if the invaders are led by a particular vital com- mander (such as the aforementioned necromancer Balakur, without whom his armies are mostly mindless). In most instances, however, a resistance movement goes beyond a single adventure and might drive an entire campaign, involving a mix of direct combat, espionage, hiding, and inﬁ ltration of enemy command structures.",

Streets are cordoned off or become impassible. Shopkeepers cannot work, reach their shops, or obtain supplies, and their customers cannot get to them. While local criminal guilds likely lie low, petty crimes such as brawls and drunkenness increase. Military and local ofﬁ  cials come into conﬂ  ict, and dock-owners ﬁ nd their piers reserved for military use. The necessity of feeding and supplying troops—both currently and for their further travels—can cause shortages even in a city that is nowhere near the front lines. PCs might be directly involved in security or supply measures, or might simply be inconvenienced like the rest of the citizens. Espionage:  During wartime, city rulers often grow wary of spies in their midst, and likely with good reason. Adventurers might be hired to hunt down spies or to guard important ﬁ  gures. Alternatively, the PCs might be caught up in the government’s crackdown and be declared outlaws, or at least placed under heavy surveillance. This could be due to speciﬁ  c actions on their part, or simply because the city’s leaders do not trust adventurers who lack strong military allegiance. Persecution:  Individuals who belong to the culture or region with whom the city is at war face persecution and even violence. If, for instance, a human city is at war with a community of dwarves, all dwarves in that city—regardless of their nationality—could ﬁ  nd their shops vandalized or their homes burned, or might even be assaulted in the streets. PCs could ﬁ  nd themselves protecting these innocent victims against assailants and even mobs, all the while struggling to ﬁ  nd out if any of the “victims” really is an enemy spy. RACIAL CONFLICT In some cities, racial interaction is not harmonious. One city might welcome all the standard races, but treat its small goblinoid population as slaves. Another treats most of the standard races as equals, while persecuting those of mixed heritage such as half-elves and half-orcs. A third might be dominated by humans and elves, who treat dwarves as second-class citizens and heavy labor-ers, while a fourth is so thoroughly human-dominated that all other races are relegated to poverty and under- representation in the government. On a societal level, a persecuted race normally dwells in race-speciﬁ  c districts or ghettos, most of which are quite impoverished. They cannot hold government posi- tions and might be forbidden to serve in the military. In extreme cases, they cannot own property and are permitted to work only the most menial of jobs. These slums have a high crime rate, both because they are full of desperate people, and because the city guard rarely worries about patrolling them (except possibly to watch for signs of social unrest). PCs and adventurers of these persecuted races face overt hostility or at least condescension, and must prove themselves many times over before they earn even half the respect granted to others of their abilities. In some cases, merely owning a weapon or knowing how to cast spells might mark them as criminals. Sometimes, when conditions grow too difficult to endure, a racial uprising results. In most instances, these revolts are swiftly put down by the better equipped and better trained militia, but if the persecuted population is large enough, or if they have other citizens on their side, they might succeed in actually overthrowing the government, or at least forcing change. PCs might take it upon themselves to protect the perse- cuted races from crime and monsters, since the watch will not do so. They might supply the poor districts with goods that those districts cannot legally acquire. They might even take on the city, protecting the persecuted from abuse or attempting to change the legal and cultural status quo. Racial conﬂ  ict can be a very sensitive subject. Prejudice is all too common in the real world, and some players prefer that it not rear its head in their games. The DM should be aware of his players’ comfort levels and avoid dealing with racial conﬂ  ict if it appears to be making any of them uncomfortable. If a city ofﬁ  cially and legally persecutes speciﬁ  c citi- zens, reduce its law rank by 2, and penalize any legal rolls involving members of that race by 4. If the city does not formally condone persecution, but informally allows it, reduce the law rank by 1, and penalize rolls by 2. Most cities that formally oppress one or more races are lawful, while those who informally allow such persecution tend to be chaotic. No good society permits this sort of racial persecution. CITY LAW While the degree of enforcement and the severity of the law varies from city to city, the legal system and its agencies are a major part of the urban setting. LAW RANK AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Dungeon Master’s Guide II provides in-depth information on courts, crime, and punishment in D\u0026D cities. For those without access to DMG 2 , consider the following version of those systems.",

        "description":  "The defendant must battle a chosen champion of the court. The winner is declared victorious in the eyes of the gods. Sentencing Only a few cities make use of prisons as punishment. In most cases, prisons serve primarily as a place to hold the accused until trial. Fines:  Many petty crimes are punished with ﬁ  nes, often amounting to several times the value of properties stolen or damaged. Forced Labor:  The criminal must serve the city, the victim of his crime, or some other power for a period of months to years. A few must serve for life, becoming little more than slaves. Exile:  Citizens of high standing convicted of seri- ous crimes are often exiled from the city, or even the kingdom. Execution:  Serious crimes (or even petty crimes, in some harsh cultures) are punished by execution. Upper-class convicts are beheaded, while most others are hanged. Again, see Dungeon Master’s Guide II for more details on all these topics. WEAPONS, ARMOR, AND SPELLS Many cities pass laws restricting the use of weaponry and offensive spells. Specific details might vary beyond the categories presented here, but these provide a baseline from which to work. The DM should decide which of these apply to his city (or cities), regardless of the city’s law rank. Use the law rank to determine how thor-oughly these laws are enforced and punished. Some cities allow exceptions to these laws in the case of self-defense, but truly dictatorial systems do not. Weapon and Armor Laws Far more common than spell-related laws, statutes restricting the use of weapons exist across most com-munities and cultures. These laws, obviously, do not apply to city watch, soldiers, or bodyguards licensed to nobles or other important citizens. It’s also possible that they don’t apply to the PCs, depending on the characters’ relationship with the local authorities, but in particularly restrictive cultures—any city where the default is “mod- erate” or higher on the list below—they might require special permission to carry their gear. Player characters can s e c ur e  s u c h  p e rm i s s i o n  in  a d v an c e  b y  t akin g  th e  Special Dispensation feat (see Chapter Two). None:  The city does not restrict the carrying of weap- ons or the wearing of armor, though people still ﬁ  nd themselves in legal trouble if they use those weapons inappropriately. Lax:  Anything larger than a light weapon must be peacebonded  (magically bound to its scabbard or sheath). Wearing heavy armor in the streets is inappropriate.",

        "description":  "Once per day, the barbarian can enter a state of adrenaline-fueled fury, increasing both his physical might and his reaction time. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +4 bonus to Dexterity, but he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls beyond short range (30 feet). He can enter this state as an immediate action, even when flat-footed at the start of combat, so he may apply the enhanced Dexterity modifier to his initiative check. While in a state of ferocity, the barbarian cannot use any Charisma- or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimidate), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except item creation feats and metamagic feats. Ferocity lasts for a number of rounds equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier (if positive). The barbarian may prematurely end his state of ferocity. At the end of ferocity, he loses the ferocity modifiers and restrictions and become sickened (-2 on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies). Abilities that normally render him immune to being sickened (such as the Strong Stomach feat, Cityscape 64) reduce the penalties to -1, but do not remove them entirely. The barbarian can invoke ferocity only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times Cityscape, Part 1 per day at 20th level).",

This extra damage applies only against living creatures that have a discernable anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. She can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 3rd level, the scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class against any creature to which she has dealt riposte damage, as described above. This bonus lasts until the start of her next turn. If she deals riposte damage to more than one creature in a round, she gains this bonus against all of them; it is not limited to a single foe. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level).

(Thus, a greataxe would threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.) This ability stacks with the Improved Critical feat or the keen weapon enhancement. ●     At 10th level, the barbarian can make a single turn, up to 90 degrees, during a charge. ●     At 13th level, the barbarian can charge through squares occupied by his allies or by noncombatants. ●     At 16th level, the barbarian can move up to four times his speed when making a charge attack, rather than double. ●     At 19th level, the barbarian acquires a \"cleaving charge.\" If he drops an opponent on a charge attack, and he has at least 10 feet of movement remaining, he can immediately make a new charge attack against a second foe. If he drops that foe and still has movement remaining, he can charge a third, and so on until he either fails to drop a foe, or runs out of movement.

Simple concepts that can be conveyed in a few words (such as \"Help!\" or \"Drop your weapon!\") can be conveyed automatically. More complex concepts require her to make a roll: d20 + her class level + either her Wisdom modifier (if trying to understand someone else) or Charisma modifier (if trying to make someone else understand Cityscape, Part 1 her). Roll each only once per conversation. If she fails, she cannot try to communicate with that specific individual via this ability until she has gained a level. (Thus, it is possible, if she succeeds in one roll but fails in the other, to hold a conversation where she can understand the other speaker but he cannot understand you, or vice-versa.) The DC of the roll depends on creature type and how closely the individual\u0027s language is related to any of her own. The ability works most effectively with other humanoids. In this case, if the individual\u0027s language uses the same alphabet as any language she knows, the DC is 20. If it does not, the DC is 30. (See Speak Language, PH 82, for this information.) The above DCs increase by 5 if the speaker is a fey, giant, or monstrous humanoid; they increase by 10 if the speaker is an elemental. If the other individual is of any other creature type, she cannot communicate via this ability. If the speaker is deliberately trying to make himself understood, the voice of the city gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this roll. If she is attempting to interpret his speech from outside normal conversational distance (such as eavesdropping), she takes a -4 penalty on this roll. In addition, she gains Speak Language as a class skill. Cityscape, Part 2 Cityscape, Part 2 Urban Magic By Ari Marmell Cityscape presents a variety of new feats, spells, and warlock invocations that were developed in an urban environment or that you can use in a city-based setting. While these are the most prevalent of new tools and tricks for the urban adventurer, however, they are far from the only ones. Other, stranger wielders of magic, from the mysterious shadowcaster to the heretical binders, draw on powers and entities of a particularly urban bent. For those who do not practice such esoteric arts, not only magic items, but also alchemical and entirely mundane tools, exist to enhance the abilities of the city explorer. Several of the abilities and items herein reference mechanics from Cityscape. Both the shadowcaster and the binder can be found in the Tome of Magic. Spirits of the City Binders do not work their own magics, but instead call upon and bond with vestiges, strange spiritual beings from beyond the known multiverse. While none of these vestiges are entirely unique to large communities, several have both histories and abilities that lend themselves toward urban adventuring. Astaroth, Unjustly Fallen A fallen angel who would never accept responsibility for his own transgressions, Astaroth grants his summoners influence over the behavior of others, knowledge of hidden things, and the ability to sicken enemies.

(Again, use the rules for a missed splash weapon to determine direction.)

        "description":  "Highly skilled spies and assassins, ninjas can master a broad range of skills and combat techniques. Nearly every ninja perfects the arts of moving quietly and remaining hidden, and her secondary skills deﬁ  ne her role in an adventuring party or a community. Many ninjas hone skills that help them become better spies, mastering the arts of social interaction and disguise. Others take on the role of cat burglars, practicing skills that help them ﬁ  nd and bypass traps and locks. In combat, a ninja can deal out devastating blows if her opponent doesn’t know she’s there, but she’s not quite as adept as a rogue is at delivering such attacks in a prolonged battle. Ninjas jump and climb farther and faster than members of most other classes, and they are skilled acrobats as well. Ninjas also receive special training in the use of poisons, and many ninjas employ poisonous weapons in combat. Even with these impressive skills, a ninja’s most dan- gerous and remarkable powers involve the ability to step brieﬂ  y into the Ethereal Plane. By focusing her ki, a ninja can vanish from sight, walk through solid walls, and deal devastating attacks even when not physically present at the scene. As a ninja advances in level, she can turn this ability to defense, causing blows that would otherwise hit to pass harmlessly through her body. Alignment: Although ninjas have a reputation as dangerous assassins and deceptive spies, they follow many different philosophies and ideals and can be of any alignment. For every dangerous mercenary who uses her ninja training to kill for money, an honest and loyal ninja stands guard over a just lord. Most ninjas follow their own beliefs rather than the dictates of a noble or magistrate, and therefore more ninjas are chaotic than lawful.",

        "description":  "6 + Int modi - ﬁer. Class Features All of the following are class features of the ninja. Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Ninjas are proﬁ - cient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, kama, kukri, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, and siangham. Ninjas are not proﬁcient with any type of armor or shield. AC Bonus (Ex): A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencum - bered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her Armor Class. This ability does not stack with the monk’s AC bonus ability (a ninja with levels of monk does not add the bonus twice). In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every ﬁve ninja levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when a ninja is ﬂat-footed. The character loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load. Ki Power (Su):  A ninja can channel her ki to manifest special powers of stealth and mobility. She can use her ki powers a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level (minimum 1) plus her Wisdom bonus (if any). Ki powers can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is unencumbered. As long as a ninja’s ki pool isn’t empty (that is, as long as she has at least one daily use remaining), she gains a +2 bonus on her Will saves. A ninja’s ki powers are ghost step, ki dodge, ghost strike, greater ki dodge, and ghost walk. Each power is described under a separate entry below. Sudden Strike (Ex): If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ninja’s target is denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexter - ity bonus or not), the ninja deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with her attack. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points for every two ninja levels thereafter. A ninja can’t use sudden strike when ﬂanking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sudden strikes. A ninja can’t make a sudden strike while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are out of reach. A ninja can’t use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don’t deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. The extra damage from the sudden strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. Trapﬁnding (Ex): A ninja can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . Ghost Step (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to become invisible for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 10th level, a ninja can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible. Poison Use (Ex):  At 3rd level and higher, a ninja never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a weapon. Great Leap (Su): At 4th level and higher, a ninja always makes Jump checks as if she were running and had the Run feat, enabling her to make long jumps without a running start and granting a +4 bonus on the jump (see the skill description, page 77 of the Player’s Handbook ). This ability can be used only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load. Acrobatics (Ex):  Starting at 6th level, a ninja gains a +2 bonus on Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 18th level. Ki Dodge (Su): At 6th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to cause an attack against her to miss when it might otherwise hit. When a ninja activates this ability, her outline shifts and wavers, granting her concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. See invisibility has no effect on concealment granted by the ki dodge ability, but true seeing negates the miss chance. This concealment does not stack with that caused by other effects that grant concealment or by spells such as blink or displacement . Speed Climb (Ex): A ninja of 7th level or higher can scramble up or down walls and slopes with great speed. She can climb at her speed as a move action with no penalty; however, she must begin and end the round on a horizontal surface (such as the ground or a rooftop). If she does not end her movement on a horizontal surface, she falls, taking falling damage as appropriate for her distance above the ground. A ninja needs only one free hand to use this ability. This ability can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load. Ghost Strike (Su):  At 8th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to strike incorporeal and ethereal creatures as if they were corporeal. She also can use this ability to strike foes on the Material Plane normally while ethereal (for example, while using her ghost step ability). Activating the ghost strike ability is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It affects the next attack made by the ninja, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn. Improved Poison Use (Ex): Starting at 9th level, a ninja can apply poison to a weapon as a move action. (Normally, applying a poison is a standard action, like applying an oil.) Evasion (Ex):  Beginning at 12th level, a ninja can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reﬂex save. (See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player’s Handbook. ) A ninja’s use of evasion differs slightly from a monk’s use in that a ninja can use evasion only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load. Ghost Mind (Su): At 14th level, a ninja gains a special resistance to spells of the scrying subschool. To detect or see a ninja with such a spell, the caster must make a caster level check (DC 20 + the ninja’s class level). In the case of scrying spells (such as arcane eye ) that scan the ninja’s area, a failed check indicates that the spell works but the ninja simply isn’t detected. Scrying attempts targeted speciﬁcally at the ninja do not work at all if the check fails. Ghost Sight (Su):  At 16th level and higher, a ninja can see invisible and ethereal creatures as easily as she sees material creatures and objects. Greater Ki Dodge (Su):  Starting at 18th level, a ninja’s ki dodge ability grants total concealment (50% miss chance). Ghost Walk (Su): A 20th-level ninja can spend two daily uses of her ki power to enter the Ethereal Plane for an extended period of time. This ability functions as the ethereal jaunt spell with a caster level equal to the ninja’s class level. HUMAN NINJA STARTING PACKAGE",

Although a scout can hold her own in a ﬁght, she’s at her best before combat begins, when she can use her powers of stealth and observation to ﬁnd an enemy and give her companions accurate information about what they face. The scout is a backcountry expert, exceeding even the ranger’s ability to navigate rough terrain and lead a group of companions through the wilderness. The scout also excels in a dungeon environment, and she can ﬁnd and disable traps as well as any rogue. As a scout advances in level, her senses become amazingly acute, and she can eventually operate normally even in total darkness.",

Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: Scouts are proﬁ - cient with all simple weapons, plus the handaxe, throwing axe, short sword, and shortbow. Scouts are proﬁcient with light armor, but not with shields. Skirmish (Ex):  A scout relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the scout’s turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th level). The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulner - able to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well eough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 3rd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level). A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack. Trapﬁnding  (Ex):  A scout can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . Battle Fortitude (Ex): At 2nd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves and initiative checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 20th level. A scout loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a scout cannot be caught ﬂat-footed and reacts to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. See the bar - barian class feature, page 26 of the Player’s Handbook. Fast Movement (Ex):  Starting at 3rd level, a scout’s gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player’s Handbook. A scout loses this beneﬁt when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. Trackless Step (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a scout cannot be tracked in natural surroundings.

This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the A spellthiefIllus. by S. Belledin16 CHAPTER 1 CLASSEStarget is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level, 3d6 points at 9th level, 4d6 points at 13th level, and 5d6 points at 17th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a spellthief gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack. Steal Spell (Su): A spellthief can siphon spell energy away from his target and use it himself. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a speciﬁc known spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a touch as a standard action. The target of a steal spell attack loses one 0-level or 1st-level spell from memory if she prepares spells ahead of time, or one 0-level or 1st-level spell slot if she is a spontaneous caster. A spontaneous caster also loses the ability to cast the stolen spell for 1 minute. If the target has no spells prepared (or has no remaining spell slots, if she is a spontaneous caster), this ability has no effect. A spellthief can choose which spell to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell that isn’t available, the stolen spell (or spell slot) is determined randomly from among those the target has available. For example, a 1st-level spellthief who uses this ability against a 1st-level sorcerer could choose to steal magic mis - sile. Assuming the sorcerer knew that spell, a successful steal spell attack would eliminate one 1st-level spell slot and temporarily prevent her from casting magic missile . If the same spellthief stole magic missile from a wizard who had it prepared, the wizard would lose one prepared magic missile spell (but wouldn’t lose any other magic missile spells she might also have prepared). After stealing a spell, a spellthief can cast the spell himself on a subsequent turn. Treat the spell as if it were cast by the original owner of the spell for the purpose of determining caster level, save DC, and so forth. A spellthief can cast this spell even if he doesn’t have the minimum ability score normally required to cast a spell of that level. The spellthief must supply the same components (including verbal, somatic, mate - rial, XP, and any focus) required for the stolen spell. Alternatively, a spellthief of 4th level or higher can use the stolen spell power to cast any spellthief spell that he knows of the same level or lower (effectively, this gives the spellthief one free casting of a known spell). A spellthief must cast a stolen spell (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells) within 1 hour of stealing it; otherwise, the extra spell energy fades harmlessly away. As a spellthief gains levels, he can choose to steal higher-level spells. At 4th level, he can steal spells of up to 2nd level, and for every two levels gained after 4th, the maximum spell level stolen increases by one (up to a maximum of 9th-level spells at 18th level). At any one time, a spellthief can possess a maximum number of stolen spell levels equal to his class level (treat 0-level spells as 1/2 level for this purpose). For instance, a 4th-level spellthief can have two stolen 2nd-level spells, or one 2nd-level spell and two 1st-level spells, or any other combination of 0-level, 1st-level, and 2nd-level spells totaling four levels. If he steals a spell that would cause him to exceed this limit, he must choose to lose stolen spells sufﬁcient to reduce his total number of stolen spell levels to no more than his maximum. A spellthief can’t apply metamagic feats or other effects to the stolen spell unless the speciﬁc spell stolen was prepared with such an effect. For example, a spellthief of 6th level or higher could steal a wizard’s empowered magic missile , but only if he speciﬁcally chose to steal empowered magic missile . If he chose to steal an unmodi - ﬁed magic missile , he couldn’t steal an empowered magic missile , a silent magic missile , or any other metamagic form of the spell. A spellthief couldn’t steal an empowered magic missile from a sorcerer, since the sorcerer applies metamagic effects upon casting and thus has no prepared empowered magic missile spell. This ability works only against spells. It has no effect on psionic powers or spell-like abilities (but see the steal spell-like ability class feature, below). Trapﬁnding (Ex): A spellthief can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and he can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook. Detect Magic (Sp):  A spellthief of 2nd level or higher can use detect magic a number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus, if any (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level. Spellgrace (Su): A spellthief of 2nd level or higher gains a +1 competence bonus on his saves against spells. This bonus improves to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 20th level. Steal Spell Effect (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a spellthief can siphon an active spell effect from another creature. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain the effect of a single spell Three adventurers team up for a better chance against their hulking foeIllus. by W. O’Connor16 CHAPTER 1 CLASSEStarget is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level, 3d6 points at 9th level, 4d6 points at 13th level, and 5d6 points at 17th level.

A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain the effect of a single spell Three adventurers team up for a better chance against their hulking foeIllus. by W. O’Connor18 CHAPTER 1 CLASSES 19CHAPTER 1 CLASSES affecting the target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell effect with a touch as a standard action. The spellthief can choose which spell effect to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell effect ran - domly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell effect that isn’t present, the stolen spell effect is determined randomly from among those currently in effect on the target. A spellthief can’t steal a spell effect if its caster level exceeds his class level + his Charisma modiﬁer. Upon stealing a spell effect, a spellthief gains the stolen effect (and the original creature loses that effect) for 1 minute per class level (or until the spell’s duration expires, whichever comes ﬁrst). If the spell effect’s dura - tion hasn’t expired by this time, the spell effect returns to the creature that originally beneﬁted from it. A spellthief can steal the effect of a spell only if the spell could be cast on him by the original caster. For example, a spellthief couldn’t gain the effect of an animal growth  spell (unless the spellthief is of the animal type) or the effect of a shield  spell (since that spell’s range is personal). If a spellthief tries to steal the effect of a spell not allowed to him, the effect is still suppressed on the original target of the spell for 1 minute per spellthief class level. This ability does not work on spell effects that are immune to dispel magic  (such as bestow curse ). Steal Energy Resistance (Su):  Beginning at 3rd level, a spellthief can siphon off some or all of a target’s resistance to an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, or sonic). A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead temporar - ily gain resistance 10 to an energy type to which his target is resistant (or immune). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal energy resistance with a touch as a standard action. Simultaneously, the target creature’s resistance to that energy type is reduced by 10 (to a minimum of 0). A creature with immunity to an energy type retains that immunity. If his target has more than one type of resistance to energy, a spellthief can choose which kind to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen resistance randomly from among those possessed by the target. If a spellthief chooses to steal a type of resistance that the target doesn’t possess, the stolen type of resistance is determined randomly from those possessed by the target. The resistance a spellthief gains from using this abil - ity lasts for 1 minute. If the resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen resistance disappears when the effect expires. A spellthief can use this ability multiple times, but its effects do not stack unless they apply to different types of energy. For example, throughout a long combat, a spellthief might use this ability to gain resistance to ﬁre and resistance to cold, but he could not use it twice on a creature that is resistant to ﬁre to gain twice as much resistance to ﬁre (nor to reduce the creature’s resistance to ﬁre by twice as much). At 11th level, a spellthief can steal resistance 20 to an energy type by using this ability, and at 19th level he can steal resistance 30 to an energy type.",
