A cult might leave a triskelion to guard a newfound earth node until it can be properly fortifi ed. Triskelions form the front line against invaders or heretics. The dimmest of the four elemental avatars, a black rock triskelion is a simple brute. It wades into its foes and lashes out with its three arms, exulting in the chaos and pain it causes. It can reduce lesser opponents to bleeding carcasses with a few strikes. If it fi nds an opponent easy to hit, it uses Power Attack to further increase its devastating damage. In some cases, an earth cleric rides a triskelion into battle. The cleric hammers a thick adamantine chain into the creature’s upper body to hold onto while perched on one of its spikes. Triskelions accept no other riders. Sample Encounters Black rock triskelions defend the earth temples that Ogremoch bids them serve. Guard (EL 18–21): Any temple led by a 12th-level or higher earth cleric of the Eye receives one triskel- ion as a guardian. Ogremoch might dispatch more to protect an elemental node or to assist the sect against a powerful air, fi re, or water faction of the Elemental Eye.

EL 15: A waterveiled assassin lurks within the well near a busy inn, lying in wait for a band of adventurers that have caused trouble for the Elder Elemental Eye. When the targets arrive at the inn, a half-orc spy for the water temple gives the signal to attack. That night, the assassin fl ows through the ground and the inn’s fl oor and walls to fall upon its enemies one at a time. Assassination Team (EL 16–17): Stronger targets require coordinated attacks, often using sahuagin minions.

EL 6: Ulfgar Silverhand was a dwarven defender who was killed protecting his king from a squad of orc raiders. Now he watches over the king’s tomb as an ancestral spirit. Two dwarf crossbow archers also guard the site, allowing the ancestor to engage foes in melee while they attack from range.

Only the imminent destruction of his people might bring the Soul Forger to fi ght in person. FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS A cleric of Moradin can summon a dwarf ancestor using summon monster V or a higher-level summon monster spell or can call on a dwarf ancestor for longer periods of service with a planar ally spell. The basic version of the creature can be called using lesserplanar ally, but advanced ancestors require higher-level versions of the spell. A summoner must still pay the price required for the ancestor’s service. However, because it is called in defense of Moradin’s children, the gp cost equivalent is one-half normal. Typically this offering is used to craft superior or magical battle gear for the settlement’s defenses. The cleric might instead perform a service for the settlement, such as raising dead combatants at no charge or embarking on a perilous quest. DWARF ANCESTORS IN EBERRON The dwarf clans of the Mror Holds are the undisputed masters of fi nance in Eberron, and the massive vaults beneath Korunda Gate are fi lled with incalculable wealth in both precious metals and magical artifacts. Dwarf ancestors, themselves often the spirits of long-dead leaders of House Kundarak, stand guard over these riches. Defending the wealth of clients (and of the house) is as vital to these mercantile dwarves as protecting their people in war. However, no one spirit is required to spend more than two centuries performing this duty. Lesser vaults 6.

When Yarshag saw that the interlopers were actually strong enough to eliminate the dragon, he gladly betrayed his mistress and offered to lead the hunters to her. However, he secretly bid his beetle companion to bear a message of warning to the dragon. If the slayers won their battle, Yarshag would be hailed as a wise leader who seized the chance to free his people. If the dragon was victorious, surely she would reward Yarshag for leading the intruders to their doom. The battle between the slayers and the black dragon turned out far better than Yarshag could have dreamt. They slew the dragon, but only one of them, a dwarf berserker, survived. Yarshag hid during the clash and watched from a distance, and when the dragon fell, the treacherous druid leapt upon the dwarf and fi nished him off. Thus, Yarshag was left with the dragon’s hoard and, more important, a small clutch of dragon eggs. Yarshag believed that he could hatch the dragons and har- vest their blood, then employ the liquid to impart draconic strength and cunning to the tribe’s young. He perfected this process on his own children, making them stronger, tougher, and faster. With the great wealth looted from the dragon’s trove, he instilled greed and ambition in the tribe.

Some lunar ravager bands are chaotic neutral, hunting to test their skill and rarely killing weak foes for sport. These neutral fey might even trade with other creatures. SOCIETY Lunar ravager society is clannish and based on the principles of strength, battle prowess, bluster, and wealth. Each clan is a family of individuals related by blood or mating. A lunar ravager wins status in its clan by returning from raids with ample loot, fi ne trophies, and rich food and drink. Female and male lunar ravagers equally earn standing in their society, based on merit. A clan of lunar ravagers lives in a hunt- ing lodge built on a cloud. The residents of a lodge have basic control over their direction of travel, but the chaotic rav- agers usually allow the wind to carry them where it will. They prefer to keep moving rather than linger in one place for too long. This strategy prevents over- hunting of an area.

Tales claim that they arise as the result of a rare contagion, but in truth any diseased corpse serves to produce these monstrosities. A plague walker that becomes separated from its master remains in place and attempts to fulfi ll its last orders to the best of its abilities. Thus, a walker ordered to stand guard deep within a dungeon might do so for centuries until intruders disturb it. Although a plague walker is barely intelligent, it can understand simple phrases in Common and can be ordered to ignore creatures bearing a certain holy symbol or speaking a password. Since a walker lacks the intelligence to deal with complex situations or conditions, its must rely on simple signs to distinguish friend from foe. For example, a plague walker might be ordered never to attack a hobgoblin, or to attack only elves. Clever adventurers who don an opponent’s uni- form, display an appropriate holy symbol, or pull off some other form of deception can confuse a plague walker or slip by it unmolested. Thus, a plague walker’s master must command it care- fully, since unclear or easily subverted orders render the creature ineffective.",

Sailsnakes can live up to twelve years, but in the wild a life span of fi ve to seven years is more typical. The mating season is very short, just a couple of weeks in the early autumn. During this time, the males become vibrantly col- ored and quest about restlessly in search of females. Females are very picky and might not mate at all in a season if they fi nd no one to their liking. A compat- ible pair stays together during this time.

ECOLOGY Dryads or nymphs who mate with verdant princes, or who are themselves evil, sometimes give birth to verdant princes. Verdant princes mature swiftly after birth, becoming full- grown and independent after a season. Powerful and convinced of their superiority, verdant princes care little for their mothers and typically despise their fathers, even if either parent was also a verdant prince. Like many other fey, verdant princes are nearly immortal. Verdant princes have a diet much like that of humans but require one-third of the food a human of the same size needs. Thus, verdant princes have little impact on the envi- ronment and often rely on fey servants to fetch them what they require.",

It charges toward the nearest opponent and pqqqqqqqqqrs fi ghts until the foe is dead. It then switches to a different 198 NREZ STNEMIREPXE opponent, and so on, until it dies or its opponents are all defeated. Zerns see blade thralls as disposable resources. A zern always puts its safety above a thrall’s well-being, and the thralls are bred to willingly accept even suicidal orders from their masters. For example, a thrall might barrel through a rank of enemy fi ghters, accepting attacks of opportunity, to attack an enemy spellcaster or archer. Although blade thralls are skilled combatants capable of dealing great damage, most zerns see them as little more than mobile shields. Usually, a thrall makes a few attacks at the start of a battle. If its attacks are ineffective, the zern commands it to focus on defense, especially when facing a foe that the thrall cannot possibly overcome. In this case, the thrall’s sole task is to protect the zern. It fi ghts defensively or even takes the total defense action to hold out as long as possible. A blade thrall might also use the aid another action, usually to improve the zern’s AC. Blade thralls also serve zerns by capturing living creatures. They are trained to wield nets and use them to entangle and neutralize promising test subjects. Once a creature is trapped and subdued, the blade thralls drag it back to the zerns’ lair. Sometimes the zerns sell blade thralls to other races. The thralls obey their new masters as faithfully as they would zerns.
