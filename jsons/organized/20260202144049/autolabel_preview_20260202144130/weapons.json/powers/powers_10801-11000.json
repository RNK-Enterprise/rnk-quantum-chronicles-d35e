Lukacs 9 RETPAHC NOITARREBA EHT RETNUH ABOLETHS with a beholder is simply a question of assembling the right Adventurers preparing to confront aboleths face three major resources in the right place. Beholders possess three advantages challenges: the monsters’ intelligence, their mental powers, that must be accounted for: the deadly eye rays, the antimagic and their environment. cone, and their ability to fl y. Aboleths are ruthless geniuses. They do not overlook Dealing with the eye rays is diffi cult, but not impossible. weaknesses in their defenses and they easily anticipate an The simplest method is to use antimagic fi eld to render oneself enemy’s actions. They respond to threats with effi ciency and invulnerable to the direct effect of the eye rays, and then kill guile, dispatching mind-controlled spies to learn the heroes’ the monsters with missile fi re if they hover out of reach. If routines and vulnerabilities, using divination magic to monitor no spellcaster in the party can cast the spell, acquiring a the heroes’ activities, and concocting ruses and traps likely to scroll of antimagic fi eld before confronting beholders is a wise confuse or snare the heroes. idea. This tactic has drawbacks: Not everyone can produce There is no good answer to aboleth intelligence, but at the an antimagic fi eld on demand, the characters’ own magic can’t very minimum, an aboleth hunter should make use of magic work as long as the party shelters within the fi eld, and clever designed to obscure divinations such as nondetection, detect beholders can still cause great damage by disintegrating the scrying, and mind blank. Searching out humanoid minions ceiling overhead or using telekinesis to hurl heavy objects of the aboleths with spells such as detect thoughts or detect into the antimagic fi eld. magic is another sound tactic. Even people well known to the Without an antimagic fi eld, attacking beholders becomes a heroes should be checked regularly to make sure that they much more dangerous proposition. The best tactic is to limit have not fallen under the sway of an aboleth master. Finally, the number of eyes that can be used against the party. Instead clever heroes could make a point of showing the aboleths of surrounding the monsters, experienced beholder hunters what they expect to see. Instead of killing or freeing a spy stay closely grouped so that the monsters can bring only a known to be enslaved by the aboleths, the heroes could allow few eye rays into play at a time. Anything that obscures the spy to continue her reports, carefully allowing her to or limits vision is useful. A common smokestick observe some activities and not others. Aboleths are smart provides concealment that the beholder’s enough to see through such a tactic if it is not handled with antimagic cone can’t skill and subtlety. disperse, while Preparing to deal with the mental powers of the aboleths is a key part of any successful expedition against the monsters. Nothing can destroy a band of heroes quicker than having a powerful fi ghter switched from an ally to a foe by a spell of mental domination. Any steps that improve a character’s Will save are virtually mandatory for an aboleth hunter. Characters who expect to face aboleths would be well advised to take the Iron Will feat at the fi rst opportunity, and to acquire defensive items such as cloaks of resistance if at all possible. Use of the protection from evil spell exemplifi es a particularly good tactic to employ against aboleths; a charac- ter so protected cannot be made to attack his comrades. The third diffi culty in defeating the aboleths lies in their preferred environment, the cold and lightless waters of the underground. Any aboleth seriously threat- ened by land-bound attackers can simply retreat into the dark depths of its lair. Spells such as water breathing and freedom of movement are absolutely essential for cornering aboleths that have chosen to retreat from a fi ght. Polymorph is another good tactic, as is using summon monster to conjure an aquatic monster that can go where the heroes cannot. Without the ability to pursue aboleths into their submerged lairs, aberration hunters fi nd that the monsters are exceed- ingly hard to fi nish off. BEHOLDERS Despite the fact that they are individually more powerful than aboleths, beholders are in some ways easier foes to combat. They lack the sheer genius, 174 organization, and minions of the aboleths; dealing Protected by an antimagic fi eld, Mialee and Tordek take the battle to a dreaded beholder recnepS .R yb .sullI HUNTER THE ABERRATION CHAPTER 9 summoned air elementals can be directed to form whirlwinds that create obscuring clouds of dust and debris. Unlike the eye rays, not much can be done about the antimagic cone. In some respects, arranging the fi ght in such a way that the beholders’ best move is to keep the characters in the antimagic cone is a win for the heroes, since it negates the peril of the eye rays. Heroes hoping to use magic to reach or strike beholders should provide themselves with a respectable nonmagical ranged attack, just in case—heavy and accurate archery fi re can slay beholders more easily than fl ying characters wielding magic swords. The beholders’ abil- ity to fl y is not particularly because their mental powers allow them to infi ltrate human- oid strongholds or settlements and quickly escape from dangerous situations. Mind fl ayers are also quite skilled at directing their thralls to spy on and harass heroes in places of supposed safety. As with aboleths, there is no good answer to calculating, pragmatic genius combined with inhuman evil. The illithid hunter should take steps to block divinations and expose mind fl ayer thralls that might be spying on him, while doing unique.

The Iron Will feat is useful, providing a employ through the use of their antimagic potentially crucial edge in resisting mind blast and other cones. Beholders build their lairs to take advantage mind-affecting spells and abilities. Unfortunately, the of this tactic by incorporating vertical shafts with protection from evil spell does not negate a mind blast in the twists and turns just long enough for eye ray range, but not same way it halts mental control; defending against mind long enough for them to be exposed to long-range missile fi re blast requires spell resistance, protection from spells, or the best they can’t return. Again, ranged weapons can reach beholders defense, spell immunity, which gives a character immunity to that refuse to come into melee range. any 4th-level spell or spell-like ability (such as mind blast). Another useful tactic is to use summon monster to conjure MIND FLAYERS a creature that can’t be stunned, such as an elemental, and Much like the aboleths, illithids are frighteningly intelligent, send the summoned creature against the mind flayers, or coldly analytical, and armed with potent mental powers.
