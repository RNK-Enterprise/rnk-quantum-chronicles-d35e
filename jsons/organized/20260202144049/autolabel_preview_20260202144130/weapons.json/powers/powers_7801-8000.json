If both cultures have runic alphabets, chances are or the inaccuracies that once did exist might have been great that the human alphabet demonstrates a lot of eradicated over time. Elven influence. When considering the runic system To translate scribed runes into English words, of a particular culture in a world where runes are in consider how a letter sounds instead of just how it widespread use, a DM should be able to answer these looks, because sometimes multiple letter-symbols in questions: Did this culture develop its runes or borrow English represent the same sounds.

For example, the Germans had very English. This is done so the sound a vowel (or vowel simple runes that had either vertical or perpendicular combination) makes can be accurately depicted. Using staves because such a formation was easiest to carve similar reasoning, consonant characters that represent into wood, their most abundant material.

Such a device should be usable only in this tesseract, naturally. The more cruel DMs among us would no doubt leave Tesseracts out such frills, forcing the hapless party to rely on knock or teleport spells, wishes, or even divine intervention. OR, MAKING METICULOUS Going by the description given above, we can see MAPMAKERS MAD that since E is adjacent to C, it must share a wall with N and a wall with S. As represented, each room does by Gary Jordan, DRAGON #17, August 197S the same thing with adjacent rooms. Now for the real mind boggier: room F. F is adjacent to E; the rooms A tesseract, as everyone (or at least readers of Robert immediately adjacent to E are N and S; therefore F A. Heinlein\u0027s \"And He Built A Crooked House\") knows, shares a wall with N and a wall with S. But sharing a wall is a four-dimensional cube or \"hypercube,\" This makes the rooms adjacent, and W is adjacent to both N and S, so F must share its fourth and final wall with ceiling of U, one finds oneself climbing through the W, which means that room F is the room outside the ceiling of F upside down! And of course the corollary square formed by the outer walls of E, N, W, and S. holds true for room L. For the purposes of the DM, all he need do is make Unless you\u0027re the type of DM who delights in having some notation and keep a separate map (such as figure 3), people fall on their heads, it is highly recommended which gives him the basic floor plan of his tesseract.

So long as any door remains open, the tesseract is not activated. Opening a second door allows the party to Another Look At pass through room C as though the others didn\u0027t exist. Tesseracts If all four doors are allowed to be closed at the same time, no matter how briefly, thereafter all doors will lead to the next room of the tesseract. by Allen Wells, DRAGON #3S, June 1980 As previously mentioned, rooms U and L present peculiar problems. An anomaly might become A fairly thorough description of a tesseract is necessary apparent: if one enters F by climbing through the at first, for readers to understand the rest of the article. If you think you already understand tesseracts, you may just skim, this section and look at the diagrams. There are two ways of showing a cube in two dimensions. Unfolding the cube and showing how to put it back together again, or showing what its \"projection\" or \"shadow\" into 2-space looks like. Similarly, there are two ways to show a tesseract in three dimensions. The first way to show a tesseract is to \"unfold\" it. In figure 4, the two faces of cubes labeled \"a\" connect to each other in such a way that the dots connect. Since these faces are really connected, you can redraw the tesseract as in figure 4-B where I have \"rolled\" the cubes up the tesseract. I could have rolled them again (\"e\" matches \"e\" and \"d\" matches \"d\"). Now that we can see how the \"d\" faces match, I can move the top cube to match the side cube (transition from 4-A to 4-C). Not the orientation of the dot on face \"e.\" Now we can begin to explore the possibilities of a tesseract. Start out by mapping out your dungeon, either using figure 3 and showing how all the faces connect, or 4-A. In either case you have to keep track of what cube you are mapping in and what surface is the floor.",

Imagine the battles one. Obviously, the rooms have to be cubical, but where between parties standing on different walls. Or, how should doors, stairs, and ladders be, and how big should about flights of arrows coming down from a party on the rooms be? The major consideration is as follows. You need leading from that wall to the ceiling. If the stairway is to have good connectivity. Since you presumably just a flight of steps in the air, the back of the stairway want your party to have access to every wall as a floor is another stairway! When he gets to the ceiling, he (although maybe you do not...) you might want a climbs back around and goes through the door in the stairway or ladder to the ceiling, doors on all walls, ceiling (presumably there is a platform provided for and a trap-door on every ceiling and floor. Note that this). Another, more complicated, way is to have tubes you have to be able to get up and down somewhere, rather than plain stairways leading from door to otherwise you can\u0027t turn a ceiling into a wall. Also note door, then have another stairway functioning as the that if you want complete connectivity, this means a \"ceiling\" of each stairway. This may be less esthetic, ladder or stairway from every floor to the appropriate but it allows for more battles on stairways. ceiling. There are three obvious answers. The last problem is, how do you get in and out of The first possibility is to have small rooms (about 8 the tesseract? Mathematically, this is no problem at ft. x 8 ft. x 8 ft.), so characters can climb through any all, since each cube of the tesseract borders on the trap door in the ceiling and then safely drop to the floor outside as well as on other cubes just like the faces of the room below. Unfortunately, such rooms are little of a cube border on the outside as well as other faces more than closets. of the cube. In reality, there are other considerations. The second possibility is to have large rooms (at least People are not 4-dimensional, so presumably they can 20 ft. x 20 ft. x 20 ft.) and have four doors in each wall, one go only one way through any door. Getting the party on each side. In the center of each floor you have a spiral in is no problem, but how should they get out? If they stairway, elevator, or ladder for going up and down. are very high-level, you might make them rely on wish The third possibility is to have large rooms and only or teleport.

It never fights unless it does so from an advantageous position, and a purple dragon is typically patient and smart enough to abandon an attack that proves fruitless or unexpectedly difficult. Many of these beasts favor magic items and spells that allow them to spy on potential targets, the better to prepare a cunning plan. Breath Weapon (Su): A purple dragon\u0027s breath weapon can take on three different forms. It can manifest as a cone of searing energy, a burst of blinding power, or a deadly blade of pure energy. In its cone form, the purple dragon\u0027s breath weapon deals the listed damage as normal. Creatures must make Reflex saves for half damage. In its burst form, the dragon\u0027s energy manifests as a blinding flash. All creatures within the ability\u0027s radius must make Fortitude saves or be permanently blinded. PURPLE DRAGON SIZE BURST RADIUS Medium 30 ft. Large 40 ft. Huge 60 ft. Gargantuan 80 ft. Colossal 100 ft. In the breath weapon\u0027s final form, the dragon forms a blade of energy that it uses to slash through its enemies. The dragon uses the blade as a weapon within its normal melee reach. It gains iterative attacks with this weapon as per its base attack bonus, but never more than four such attacks. The blade ignores all physical barriers, allowing the dragon to make touch attacks to strike its foes. It deals half the damage listed for the dragon\u0027s breath weapon. Because of the energy nature of the blade, the dragon does not add its Strength modifier to the damage. The dragon makes this attack in addition to its other physical attacks, although it cannot use a bite attack in the same round it attacks with its blade. The blade dissipates at the end of the dragon\u0027s action. Night Flier (Ex): The purple dragon\u0027s dark scales allow it to blend in with the night sky.

In their native environment, bog mummies prefer to ambush travelers by hiding within a bog or pool of water. Their ability to sense living creatures allows them to strike from hiding even when their position makes it impossible to directly observe a path or trail. Bog mummies use this ability to remain hidden until the last possible moment. Despair (Su): The sight of a bog mummy is enough to overwhelm a creature with crushing despair.

The mummy wraps its hands around its victim\u0027s throat. Strangulation (Ex): A bog mummy can squeeze the life out of a creature that it has in a grapple. With a successful grapple check, the mummy grabs its victim by the throat and strangles him. Note that the Constitution damage reduces the time that a character can hold his breath.

You could repeat the procedure, an important bias is probably also quite rare. possibly choosing a larger number for E. On the other hand, the belief that certain dice tend to produce more results of a certain number, or group of PRECISE TESTING numbers, is exceedingly common. It is this belief due Suppose you have observed the behavior of a particular mostly to selective memory, that makes the procedure 6-sided die, and it seems that the numbers 1, 3, and 4 outlined below of practical importance to gamers.

(I expect that the greatest value more sense to test directly whether this observation is really accurate, rather than simply making the general When a die\u0027s behavior cannot be accounted for by statistical test described earlier. If what you suspect is true, a chance, the chi-square test reveals this discrepancy. specialized test shows the bias more readily. Define an occurrence of a 1, 3, or 4 as category #1, a 2 Appendix D or 6 as category #2, and a 5 as category #3. Perform the tallying procedure as described above, only this time record each roll by category (#1, #2, or #3) rather than GOOD HITS AND BAD MISSES: by the actual number rolled. (Again, E = 10, for a total of ALTERNATE CRITICAL HIT AND 60 rolls, is a good choice.) The formula is applied like FUMBLE RULES this: The chi-square equals (count in category #1—30) 2/30 plus (count in category #2—20) 2/20 plus (count in by Carl Parlagreco, DRAGON #39. category #3—10) 2/10. Note that the value of E for each category varies. Some players want a little more variety in their For instance, since category #1 includes 3 out of the critical hits. Some also want to include a mechanic 6 possible results, this category would occur on the for catastrophic failures.

Drow of the Underdark discusses the underpinnings of drow societies and beliefs, their Lolth-dominated religion, and an example of an arche- typal drow city—all of which is vital information to players of drow characters. This material enables a player to fl esh out his character’s history, as well as providing guidance for con- ceptualizing personalities, goals, and mannerisms. For players of other races, Drow of the Underdark can be equally effective as a reference for enemies of the drow. The study of drow society included in this book not only tells you how the drow operate, but why they do what they do—and the best way to defeat a foe is to understand that foe’s motivations. New uses for skills, guidelines for creating new poisons and magical poisons, an expanded description of Drow Sign Lan- guage, and rules for training vermin all support the cultural considerations. Over 50 new feats help defi ne the fi ghting techniques of this unusual race: Several new style feats are included, as well as a number of general and metamagic feats that improve drow racial talents but are equally useful for characters of any race. As with any new game element, you should always consult your DM before you start using this material. The viability of these gameplay options depends on the role the drow will play in your DMs campaign, and by discussing your choices ahead of time, you give your DM the chance to help fi t the character into her game. WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY To use this book, you will need the three D\u0026D core rule- books—the Player’s Handbook (PH), Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG), and Monster Manual (MM). Though no other books are strictly necessary, a few will undoubtedly enhance your enjoyment of this product. Underdark is an excellent resource for exploration of the subterranean world, offering additional mechanics that complement those found in this book.

If you are not using this system in your campaign, ignore the numeric values below, and simply judge advancement through the ranks by means of age, accomplishments, level, or whatever method you think best. When a character gains access to spells and equipment, it means the house provides that material for the duration of a single endeavor. Although no formal limit exists for how often a member can do this, the DM should watch for abuse. A house grants its favors to those who prove effective. If a character constantly achieves great wealth and power for a house, it assists her in further endeavors far more frequently than it does a member who focuses primarily on her own objectives, or who regularly fails in her tasks. On average, assume that this advantage is available at most three times per year.

The drow instinct for self-preservation is a powerful one. Drow who die in disgrace are often hung from the walls of their It drives them to survive at all costs, yet advancement in homes, dishonoring their families as well drow society requires risk—including, at times, the risk of life itself. Much drow scheming is a careful balancing act, a measure of risk versus reward. If a scheme’s failure threatens death, most drow undertake it only if the benefi ts are truly substantial. Drow do not, under any circumstance, believe in self-sacrifi ce—better to sacrifi ce a dozen allies than to die oneself. It can be satisfying to watch an enemy suffer, but true victory is attained only with that enemy’s death. Anything less is transitory. Drow frequently not only slay their rivals but utterly destroy the bodies, to make any form of resurrection diffi cult if not impossible. Drow almost never die of old age, and they do not bury or entomb their dead. Those who do not fall in battle or at the hands of other scheming drow are often selected as sacrifi ces to Lolth. After all, if a high-level drow is growing old, what greater purpose has she left to serve? Drow who die of old age or natural causes are considered shamed for their failure to die in Lolth’s service. Their bodies are left to rot, or hung from their family’s home with webbing as a sign of disgrace. Many drow cremate relatives who die in this fashion—not out of respect, but to hide the evidence. Undeath Drow do not inherently shun the undead as many other races do, though they do not particularly enjoy their company either. They consider undeath a poor state of existence, since it strips drow of their inher- ent racial superiority, but they do respect the power and will of one who is capable of remaining beyond death’s call. DROW HISTORY AND FOLKLORE Although the drow are nearly as ancient as the surface elves—or even older, according to one of their various origin myths—their ancient history and folklore is rather sparse. This stems from the fact that drow aren’t especially concerned with their people’s past, except when it infl uences their present and future. They study ancient victories to replicate them, defeats to avoid them, and famously successful drow to emulate them, but that’s essentially it. For all that, the drow do have a body of legend and folklore they study and repeat to one another, even if it’s smaller than one might expect from so old a race. Many of their myths are similar to those of the surface elves—albeit Illus. by F.

DREAD FANGS IN THE WORLD “The dread fangs of Lolth are lackeys at best, but as elite guards, shock troops, and enforcers, they are useful allies. If they have one fl aw, it’s their obedience. They never question orders. Ever.” —Xune Argith, eye of Lolth The dread fangs of Lolth are important additions to any cam- paign in which the drow are featured as principal antagonists. They use drow tactics and perfect them, and so are extremely evasive, unpredictable, and mobile. Even when used along- side lesser soldiers, the dread fangs drive home the cunning tactics the drow favor, and instill in the PCs a healthy respect for their foes. Organization The dread fangs of Lolth have a presence in nearly every drow city. Wherever there are priestesses of the Spider Queen, fangs are not far. As the enforcement arm of the church, the fangs ensure that the wishes of the priestesses are fulfi lled and their enemies destroyed. The clerics assign fangs to the eyes of Lolth. Under the com- mand of these operatives, the fangs provide the muscle to ensure a successful mission. Eyes and fangs work exceptionally well together, their abilities complement- ing each other. When so paired, they can be a nearly unstoppable force. Candidates are always carefully screened before being invited to join the fangs, since the priestesses cannot afford to compromise the integrity of the organization with dissent or treasonous thoughts. They pick talented males (and rarely females) who are unswervingly loyal to the Spider Queen. Candidates endure a diffi cult period of training to alter their personalities and cor- rect their confl icting loyalties until a single-minded warrior remains. Of these, only the ones who hear the voice of Lolth are allowed to become full-fl edged members. NPC Reactions Shalzad Raelnan, a dread fang of Lolth The dread fangs of Lolth are an intimidating presence among the drow, serving as constant reminders of the priestesses’ per- vasive presence in their lives.

A chwidencha is an abomination spawned from a drow who failed one of Lolth’s many tests. STRATEGY AND TACTICS A chwidencha is a bold combatant, scuttling forward on its many legs to drive its claws into the soft fl esh of its foes. It relies on the element of surprise, attacking fast and prefer- ably fi rst. It often lies in wait just beneath the earth’s surface, waiting for prey to come within range, then pouncing to grab and impale the creature on its barbed claws. Once it slays its prey, it retreats into its burrow or another hidden location to devour its meal at leisure. If a chwidencha is damaged before it has subdued its prey, it retreats, dragging the victim with it to fi nish off in a safe place. When encountered in groups, chwidenchas attack en masse. Emboldened by their numbers, they do not content themselves with single victims but slay every living thing 108 4 RETPAHC WORD TNEMPIUQE pqqqqqqqqqrs CHWIDENCHA LORE Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) can research chwidenchas to learn more about them.

The mere sight of an attacking chwidencha terrifies its opponents. If it can, it drives its thorny appendages into its victim’s body and drags it off before devouring it. pqqqqqqqqqrs 95726720_Ch05.indd 108 2/22/07 3:29:20 PM 109 UNDERDARK MONSTERS OF THE CHAPTER 5 Chwidencha CR 9 Always N Large aberration Init +7; Senses darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft.; Listen +6, Spot +6 Aura frightful presence (30 ft., DC 16) Languages understands Undercommon AC 24, touch 12, flat-footed 21 (–1 size, +3 Dex, +12 natural) hp 114 (12 HD); DR 10/magic Fort +11, Ref +9, Will +11 Weakness vulnerability to sonic Speed 30 ft.
