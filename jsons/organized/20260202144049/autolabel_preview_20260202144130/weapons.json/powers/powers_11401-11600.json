This loan might be a reward for a task already completed, or a tool provided to accomplish a newly acquired quest. • The Sanctify Relic feat (see sidebar) allows a character to craft a relic for which he meets the requirements. While the prereq- uisite for this feat (any other item creation feat) is easy for any caster to meet, a DM could introduce story-based requirements or ramifi cations for a character who wants to craft such an item. Certainly, any local church dedicated to the same deity would take an interest in a character who suddenly appears with a shiny new relic. Creating Relics for Your Campaign The relics in this book are based on the deities of the core D\u0026D pantheon, but they don’t have to be. Moradin’s axe of ancestral virtue works just as well for any dwarven deity you create yourself—or any warlike but good deity, for that matter. If you create your own relic, price the base item—that is, the effect available to a character who doesn’t have the True Believer feat and chooses not to sacrifi ce a divine spell slot—just as you would any other magic item. The relic’s special power, however, should be virtually free—rather than assessing a gp cost, the “cost” to the character is the spell slot or feat required to unlock the power. The key is to balance the lost spell slot against the potency of the relic’s special power or powers. A relic that requires a charac- ter to sacrifi ce a 4th-level spell should provide a power roughly equivalent to (or maybe a little bit better than) a typical 4th-level spell. Such a power shouldn’t simply be a single daily use of another 4th-level spell—after all, the character could just have prepared that spell in the sacrifi ced spell slot. Instead, it should be something that the character couldn’t do with a spell slot of that level.

Chapter 5: Magic introduces spells and or chakras it can be bound to, and the effects of binding it magic items that have similar scaling effects. Any character, to each chakra. regardless of whether he can shape soulmelds, can gain access In general, binding a soulmeld to a chakra produces an to his personal pool of essentia by the selection of the proper effect similar to that granted by a magic item worn on the feat or other option. corresponding body slot. For example, binding a soulmeld to the throat chakra often grants the meldshaper abilities related to protection or discernment, CHAKRAS just as a magic amulet or scarab usually Chakras are the body’s ten centers of power: crown, feet, hands, arms, does. Other thematic ties link brow, shoulders, throat, waist, heart, and soul. the powers of soulmelds to their chakra Similar to and closely linked with ten of the magic item spaces on the body described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the ten chakras represent locations on the body where a meldshaper can place a soulmeld. Meldshapers have access to all their chakras for the purpose of shaping soulmelds to occupy them. CHAKRA BINDS A soulmeld can be bound to a chakra in order to gain a secondary (and often more potent) effect from it. Doing so cuts off the corresponding body slot from magic item use—binding a soulmeld to your feet chakra means you can’t wear magic boots, for example. A skilled meldshaper can bind some of his soulmelds to chakras to gain new powers from those soulmelds. When a meldshaper binds a meld to a chakra, it becomes supernatu- rally tied or affi xed to that body location. As a side effect of the chakra bind, the meldshaper loses the ability to benefi t from a magic item occupying the body slot associated with that chakra. A meldshaper can shape soulmelds to occupy any of his chakras even at 1st level. However, the chakras are defi ned by a relative level of power or diffi culty for the purposes of binding soulmelds to them. As a meldshaper increases in level, he learns to bind soulmelds fi rst to his least chakras (crown, feet, and hands), then lesser (arms, brow, and shoul- ders), then greater (throat and waist), and eventually to his heart and soul chakras. A meldshaper can only bind soulmelds to a limited Arstor, a Pentifex Monolith number of his chakras, but that number increases as he gains (see page 209) levels.

        "description":  "with that feat, you can have two soulmelds occupying or bound to the same chakra. The totemist’s totem chakra is unusual in several respects. It does not correspond to any body slot, so soulmelds cannot occupy the totem chakra. For this reason, the totem chakra appears in parentheses at the end of this entry for totemist melds. When a totemist wishes to bind a soulmeld to her totem chakra, she must choose a different chakra for that soulmeld to occupy. Regardless of the chakra occupied by the soulmeld, however, the totemist can bind it to her totem chakra. This is an exception to the normal rule that a soulmeld can only be bound to the chakra it occupies. At higher levels, totemists gain the ability to change which of their soulmelds are bound to their totem chakras. Although this might entail a signifi cant change in the totemist’s appearance and abilities, no soulmelds actually change location on her body when she rebinds her melds. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Quarranal Rhiannavar is a 3rd-level duskling totemist. As a 3rd-level totemist, he has the ability to shape three soulmelds at a time (and his Constitution is 17, easily high enough to allow this). At the start of this day, he spends an hour selecting his soulmelds; he decides to shape sphinx claws, totem avatar, and blink shirt. His sphinx claws occupy his hands chakra and his blink shirt occupies his heart chakra. The totem avatar soulmeld can occupy the arms, feet, heart, or shoulders chakra. His blink shirt already occupies his heart chakra, so Quarranal chooses to place his totem avatar on his arms chakra. Quarranal has access to and can bind soulmelds to his totem chakra. When he shapes his soulmelds, he can choose to bind any one of them to his totem chakra. (None of them can occupy his totem chakra, however.)
