It then uses its swal- lowing charge, wading into melee with survivors afterward. Its only goal is to slay and devour its foes, so it uses Power Attack liberally and tries to swallow any creature it man- ages to grab. Every round it unleashes a prismatic spray. A garngrath favors melee over using its devastating roar unless it plans to retreat. If dangerous enemies remain after the ear-splitting bellow, a garngrath might fl ee using its plane shift ability. SAMPLE ENCOUNTER Garngraths appear in numbers greater than one only when they precede a great extraplanar army. Slaughter Cometh (EL 20): It approaches on the horizon—a great garngrath unleashed by an extraplanar entity bent on the destruction of the PCs’ entire civilization. The voracious monstrosity has already reduced three cities to rubble, and the characters’ haven is next. Unless the characters slay the garngrath, thousands will perish before its other worldly gluttony. ECOLOGY Erythnul created the first garngraths to accompany and amuse him, attaching crystal horns to them to add to the mayhem. He purposefully let some garngraths slip into the wilds of Pandemonium, along with the mystery of crafting and grafting the crystal horns. Extremely powerful Garngrath extraplanar entities have used this knowledge and garngraths in warfare since then.

Because the mind fl ayers of Thoon have been traveling across the planes gathering quintessence, their hoard is a good place to introduce particularly weird, otherw orldly treasures, such as strangely marked coinage, bizarre and disturbing art, and magic items with ornamenta- tion that is clearly of extraplanar origin. The value of quintessence—to anyone except the follow- ers of Thoon—is deliberately left vague. This doesn’t have to remain true in your campaign, however. Perhaps quintes- sence can be used as a substitute for experience points in item and construct creation. Quintessence could instead be a material component for new spells or rituals you introduce into your campaign, or it could be an optional component that makes certain types of magic more potent. Items and constructs created using quintessence can have weird quirks and drawbacks. Spells cast using it are bizarre or take on aberrant aspects. The moral implications of using a material gathered from innocent (or not) sentient creatures also comes into play. If you use quintessence in one or more of these ways, or make it valuable at all, consider that value when assigning treasure to encounters you create using the followers of Thoon.
