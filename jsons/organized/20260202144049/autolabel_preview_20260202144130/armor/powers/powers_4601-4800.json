Tales speak of nereids as beautiful women who drown men with a kiss, but in fact they are extremely shy. A nereid is nearly impossible to detect in its element, with a shimmering body that is almost transparent. On the rare occasions that a nereid leaves the water, it takes on a more solid-looking appearance, resembling a pale elf wearing a distinctive shawl. Nereids are often found in the company of sea creatures and water elementals. They speak Aquan with voices that sound like the soft hiss of surf. COMBAT A nereid relies on concealment and camouflage to avoid danger, and it does not attack unless in the most desperate circumstances (such as retrieving a stolen shawl). Nereids use their water magic to hold back attackers and summon elemental allies to assist them in combat. Drown (Su): A nereid can make a special touch attack to try to fill an opponent’s lungs with water. The opponent can resist this effect with a DC 16 Fortitude save.

For example, if both ships had a ram rating of 3d6, then anyone caught between the ships would take 3d6 points of damage. Defending the Sable Drake When the pirate ship prepares to attack a target or defend itself, the goblin crew set up a large number of traps to give themselves an advantage against any foes who attempt to board the Sable Drake.
