PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE Past the timeless eons that lie between the stars, pseudonatural creatures dwell beyond the planes as we know them, nestled in far realms of insan- ity. When summoned to the Material Plane, they often take on the form and abilities of familiar creatures, though they are more gruesome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. Alternatively, they might appear in a manner more consistent with their origins, manifesting as masses of writhing tentacles or other even more terrible-looking forms. SAMPLE PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE This ﬂ apping horror has a vaguely horse- like body with the forelegs and wings of a huge, foul bird. Grotesque pustules erupt from its ﬂ esh, ichor oozing from the vari- ous extrusions, and a long, serpentine tail thrashes behind the creature.

Lore of the Seekers: Seekers spread and believe in many different tales regarding the origin of the primal music. The one that has the most boisterous adherents (and sees the most rancorous debate) posits that some three thousand years past, an angelic being named Karoninwaithe brought the sounds of the primal music to Haeldriss Fey, an elf bard of great skill who devoted the rest of his days to spreading the primal music and seeking to more fully understand its power. Other sages (and even some seekers as well) claim that Karoninwaithe was actually a ﬁ end in disguise, and that the music that the seekers touch is actually a form of infernal power. Those who espouse this theory believe in the captivating nature of the music, and they point out how creatures once controlled by a powerful seeker are often driven to seek further exposure to the primal music.",
