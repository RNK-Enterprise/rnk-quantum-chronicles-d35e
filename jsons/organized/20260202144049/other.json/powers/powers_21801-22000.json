        "description":  "EPIC LEVELS AND PRESTIGE CLASSES The epic rules allow you to go beyond the normal level limit in a prestige class, but only if it is a ten-level class. Why can’t you add levels to a prestige class with fewer than ten levels? It’s Too Easy: Maxing out a ten-level prestige class takes a lot of time and effort, detracting significantly from your pursuit of the core classes. Even after maxing out a prestige class with only five levels, for instance, you haven’t taken more than a short detour from your main class or classes. It’s Not Significant Enough: Characters with ten levels in the assassin prestige class undoubtedly think of themselves as as - sassins, regardless of the fact that they also have ten levels in one or more other classes. If you’ve taken fewer than ten levels in a prestige class, those levels represent a smaller fraction of your character’s identity. It’s Hard to Build an Epic Progression: With only a few levels to guide you, it’s hard to determine what an appropriate progres - sion of class features would be for the class. The rate of improve - ment of a special ability might be too fast to extrapolate over an infinite number of levels, or there might simply be too few class features to build a unique epic progression. That said, if your DM wants to allow a character to gain epic levels in a prestige class with fewer than ten levels in its progression, that’s okay. Work together with your DM to create an epic progression for the class (see the Behind the Curtain: Building an Epic Progression sidebar, page 210 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs192 CHAPTER 6",
