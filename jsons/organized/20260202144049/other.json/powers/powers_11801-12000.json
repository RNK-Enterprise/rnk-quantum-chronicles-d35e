Your meldshaper level is equal to one-half your soulborn level. A soulborn can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2–3: The Soulborn. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds on the table, whichever is lower. At 4th level, you can shape one soulmeld at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 11). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 6th level, you gain access to your personal pool of essen- tia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool’s size is shown on Table 2–3: The Soulborn. Your character level, as noted on Table 2–1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50).
