        "description":  "Difficult ter- rain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement. When movement is hampered, each square moved into usu- ally counts as two squares, effectively reducing the distance that a character can cover in a move. For example, a character moving through difficult terrain (such as undergrowth) pays 2 squares of movement per square moved into (double the normal cost). If more than one condition applies, multiply together all additional costs that apply. (This is a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling; see page 304.) For instance, a character moving through diffi- cult terrain in darkness would pay 4 squares of movement per square moved into (double cost times double cost is quadruple cost).
