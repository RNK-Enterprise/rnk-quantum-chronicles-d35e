The light of self-righteousness burns strongly within an inquisitor, and he never faces the self-doubt or moral dilemmas that heroes of less conviction must deal with. It is this overwhelming conﬁdence in his own ability to deﬁne what is right and wrong, however, that sometimes leads an inquisitor into darkness. The path of the inquisitor is long and danger - ous, and those who complete it are among the most powerful and persistent opponents of evil. But those CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 70who fall, having known the heights of purity, become evil beyond reckoning. Convinced of their own moral purity, fallen inquisitors pursue their vile agenda without ever feeling doubt, and they are often charismatic enough to draw others into their wicked plans. Should an inquisitor who also has paladin levels ever gain levels in the blackguard class, his shadowbane inquisitor levels stack with his paladin levels when determining the number of extra abilities that the blackguard gains for having paladin levels. For example, if a 5th-level paladin/1st-level rogue/5th-level shadowbane inquisitor takes a level of blackguard, he gains extra blackguard class abilities as if he were a fallen paladin of 10th level.

        "description":  "At every level indicated on the accompanying table, a shadowmind gains additional power points per day and access to new discovered powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever psionic manifesting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other beneﬁt a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one psionic class before becoming a shadowmind, she must decide to which class to add the new level of shadowmind for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level. Read Thoughts (Ps): At 1st level, a shadowmind adds read  thoughts to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest read thoughts at a reduced power point cost. The cost of read thoughts is reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Sneak Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 2nd level, a shad - owmind deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when ﬂanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level and 3d6 points at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player’s Handbook . If a shadowmind gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack. Cloud Mind (Ps): At 3rd level, a shadowmind adds cloud  mind to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest cloud mind at a reduced power point cost. The cost of cloud mind is reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Mass Cloud Mind (Ps): At 9th level, a shadowmind adds mass cloud  mind to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest mass cloud mind at a reduced power point cost. The cost of mass cloud mind  is reduced by the shadowmind’s level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level. Mind Stab (Su):  A 10th-level shadowmind can combine a precise blow with a burst of mental energy, removing her presence from the mind and memory of her victim even as she stabs him. Once per round as a free action, immediately after successfully dealing sneak attack damage to an opponent, a shadowmind can manifest cloud mind against that opponent.Mysk, a shadowmind Table 2–20: The Shadowmind Base Attack Fort Ref WillLevel Bonus Save Save Save Special Powers Known 1st +0 +0 +2 +2 Read thoughts +1 level of existing manifesting class 2nd +1 +0 +3 +3 Sneak attack +1d6 —  3rd +2 +1 +3 +3 Cloud mind +1 level of existing manifesting class 4th +3 +1 +4 +4 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 5th +3 +1 +4 +4 Sneak attack +2d6 —  6th +4 +2 +5 +5 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 7th +5 +2 +5 +5 — +1 level of existing manifesting class 8th +6 +2 +6 +6 Sneak attack +3d6 —  9th +6 +3 +6 +6 Mass cloud mind +1 level of existing manifesting class 10th +7 +3 +7 +7 Mind stab +1 level of existing manifesting classIllus. by M.

Changing the class’s name slightly can have a great impact on how the prestige class is perceived in your game.

Labeling the class “adventuring acrobat” or something similar gives the class a reason to exist that has little to do with high-level burglaries.",

O’ConnorCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 84CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 85Slow Fall (Ex): Begin- ning at 2nd level, a thief-acrobat reduces the effective distance of falls by 20 feet. At 4th level, this improves to reduce the effective distance of falls by 30 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player’s Handbook. If a thief-acrobat has this ability from another class, the distances stack to determine the effective reduc- tion of the falling distance. Acrobatic Charge (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a thief- acrobat can charge in situations where others cannot. She can charge over difﬁ  cult terrain that normally slows movement or through allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to charge across a cluttered battleﬁ  eld, leap down from a ledge, or swing across a chasm to get to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain. Defensive Roll (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, once per day a thief-acrobat can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player’s Handbook . At 5th level, a thief-acrobat can use this ability twice per day. Skill Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, a thief-acrobat has become so conﬁ  dent in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Improved Evasion (Ex): A 5th-level thief-acrobat can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful  Reﬂ  ex save and takes only half damage on a failed save.

When your total gp created equals or exceeds the market price of one dose of the poison, that dose is ﬁ  nished. (You may sometimes be able to create more than one dose in a week, depending on your check result and the market price of the poison.) If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress that week. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to buy them again. DECIPHER SCRIPT  (INT) You can use the Decipher Script skill to create a private cipher. This code system allows you (or anyone with the proper key) to record information without the risk of others reading it. Any document you create using your private cipher can be read only by you or someone who has the proper decoding information. Other characters with ranks in the Decipher Script skill can attempt to decipher the code. The DC for such a decoding attempt is 10 + your total skill modiﬁ  er at the time that you create the cipher. (In effect, you “take 10” on a skill check to create the cipher, and those attempting to decode it make a Decipher Script check opposed by your take 10 result.)",
