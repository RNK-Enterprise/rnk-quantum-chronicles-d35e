However, this book is much more than a catalog of new items. Chapter by chapter, hereÆs a summary This book contains mundane, alchemical, and magic items for your RNK™ Realm. We have carefully scrutinized them for game balance and obedience to the rules. Nevertheless, we urge RNK Masters and players to discuss these items before their first appearance, because each RNK campaign is unique. An adventure set in an extremely cold region might go awry if characters have access to new items that do fire damage, because many opponents are vulnerable to fire, for example. INCORPORATING ITEMS INTO YOUR CAMPAIGN The simplest way to add the new equipment in this book to your game is to just do it: add the items without explaining where they came from and why characters are just learning about them. Everyone around the table agrees to simply adopt the fiction that the items have always been available. Maybe mundane and alchemical items were always for sale in shops and bazaars the player characters never happened to visit. One day the PCs meet a new merchant in the marketplace and gain access to new items. If that stretches credulity too far, RNK Masters may instead encourage player characters to develop or design new items as they need them. For instance, the first time characters need a flexible, collapsible ladder, they can design and build the spider poles described in Chap- ter 2: Adventuring Gear. RNK Masters may gradually introduce new equipment as NPCs discover, design, and build the new items. Player characters may discover new items when they travel to new regions. For example, if they travel to an oasis on the edge of the desert, theyÆll probably encounter merchants selling the desert outfits described in Chapter 2: Adventuring Gear. Finally, RNK Masters can take a long-term approach, adding the equipment from this book gradually and sparingly. To start, plant rumors and legends about strange magic items. As the characters gain levels and venture into more dangerous places, they uncover fragments of lost tales, including informa- tion about the magic items in this book. When the PCs finally find new magic items in a dragon hoard or similar treasure trove, theyÆll already know them by reputation. WHATÆS IN THIS BOOK The RNK Arms and Equipment Codex,as you might expect, is 3 devoted mainly to descriptions of new weapons, armor, and gear that characters and creatures can pos- sess. However, this book is much more than a catalog of new items. Chapter by chapter, hereÆs a summary of what youÆll find inside. Chapter 1: Weapons and Armor introduces dozens of new nonmagical weapons and types of armor. Here youÆll also find discussions of which weapons and armor types should be available during certain technological eras, if the technology in your campaign is more primitive than the historical medieval era. Chapter 2: Adventuring Gear greatly expands the equipment and accoutrements available to charac- ters and creatures, including adventuring gear, cloth- ing, jewelry, edible items, alchemical items, superior items, and commodities. This chapter also features a long list of new poisons and their game statistics. Chapter 3: Vehicles opens with a general discus- sion of the characteristics of vehicles and how to handle vehicles in play, particularly during combat and in the event of a collision. The chapter has a sec- tion on vehicle augmentationsùmagical and mun- dane accessories that characters can purchase to customize their vehicles or expand their capabilities. The last part of the chapter contains game statistics and other information about more than two dozen vehiclesùincluding special modes of transport such as the dwarven tunneler and the shadow carriage. Chapter 4: Hirelings and Creatures provides new rules for finding hirelings and determining how much they charge to perform the work theyÆre good at, including costs for hiring someone to cast a spell on your behalf. Those who want to assemble a fight- ing force will make use of this chapterÆs rules for hiring mercenaries and the advice on which kinds of monsters make the best exotic troops. This chapter continues with a discussion of crea- tures that can serve as companions, pets, mounts, and guard creatures. New creatures described in this chapter include the climbdog, thudhunter, axebeak, hippocampus, equine golem, zaratan, soarwhale, giant dragonfly, and giant firefly. Chapter 5: Magic Items takes up more than one fourth of this book. Following the format of Chapter 8 in the RNK Game Master\u0027s Tome, this chapter pro- vides new special abilities for magic armors, shields, and weapons; several new types of magic armor and shields; more than 150 new specific magic weapons; and separate sections for new potions, rings, rods, staffs, and wondrous items. Chapter 6: Special Magic Items presents new material on intelligent items, cursed magic items, and artifacts, also in the format of Chapter 8 in the RNK Game Master\u0027s Tome.",

        "description":  "Most weapons keep the same effective reach no matter what their size (although the reach of their potential wielders certainly changes). However, weapons that normally have a reach of greater than 5 feet have different reaches when you design them at different sizes. If youÆre designing a larger version of such a weapon, increase its reach by 5 feet for each size category it increases. A Huge guisarme has a reach of 15 feet, for example, while a Gargantuan guisarme has a reach of 20 feet. Designing smaller versions of reach weapons quickly makes reach irrelevant. A reach of 5 feet is normal for Medium-size and Small creatures. The important difference is that Tiny creatures using Small reach weapons can fight in melee as if they had 5 feet of reach, meaning they do not have to enter an opponentÆs space to attack.

Because the whip-dagger can wrap around an enemyÆs leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip dagger to avoid being tripped. A mighty whip-dagger is made with especially heavy material that allows a strong user to take advan- tage of an above-average Strength score. The mighty whip-dagger allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated. WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY In the historical real world, armor and weapons developed in parallelùan arms race with advances in defensive technology matched and often blud- geoned by advances in offensive technology. If you set your campaign in an earlier cultural period than the default assumption for the RNK game, you might want to limit access to certain weapons. Certain cultures in your campaign world may be limited to earlier technology than the mainstream, stone-age jungle dwellers being only the most obvi- ous example. Perhaps the barbarians of the frigid wastelands are limited to Dark Ages technology, while a ten-thousand-year-old empire is stuck with the Bronze Age technology handed down to it by its deity-rulers. Even if youÆre designing an entire campaign around a culture different from the generic Euro- pean flavor of the RNK Adventurer\u0027s Codex, you probably donÆt need new martial weapons; you can use the weapon equivalencies instead. Oriental Adventures, for example, has only three new martial weapons. The wakizashi is simply a masterwork short sword like the drusus, the nagamaki is statistically close to the guisarme, but lighter, less expensive, and lack- ing both reach and trip capability, and the naginata is almost identical to the glaive. Where RNK has much more room for innovation is in exotic weapons. Remember that ôexotic weaponsö in RNK doesnÆt mean ôoriginating in a foreign culture,ö it means weapons that require special training to use. Characters who use exotic weapons are spending a feat to learn how to wield them effectively, so exotic weapons generally offer some additional bang in exchange for that feat ôbuck.ö WEAPON MATERIALS",

Special Weapon Materials The various planes of existence are exotic, other- worldly landscapes where even the fundamental ele- ments of the universe may be drastically different than on the Material Plane. Extraplanar weapon- smiths use certain minerals from these planes, partic- ularly the Outer Planes, to make weapons with special qualities, and these weapons sometimes find their way to the Material Plane.

This rare metal, when alloyed into steel, can be used to create weapons of amazing sharpness. Any slashing or piercing weapon created with Baatorian green steel has a natural enhancement bonus of +1 to damage. This bonus does not stack with any other enhancement bonus. Thus, a green steel (+1 to damage) longsword with a +4 enhance- ment bonus effectively has a +4 enhancement bonus on both attacks and damage. In an area where magic does not function, it still retains its natural +1 enhancement bonus on damage. A masterwork green steel slashing or piercing weapon would have a +1 bonus on both attack and damage rolls (from a com- bination of masterwork and the green steel). Though green steel is a common component of keen weapons produced in the Lower Planes, it grants no other spe- cial ability to such weapons.

Gehennan Morghuth-Iron: This volcanic min- eral is unique to the steep mountains of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, where it is occasionally mined by neutral evil fiends called yugoloths and other creatures on that forbidding plane. It forges poorly, making weapons that appear pocked and pitted and have a û1 attack and damage penalty. However, morghuth-iron is extremely toxic, rap- idly poisoning the blood. A slashing or piercing weapon made of Gehennan morghuth-iron is naturally poisonous. The weapon delivers its poison (Endurance save DC 12) with each successful attack. The initial damage is 1 point of temporary Dexterity; the secondary damage is 1d4 points of temporary Dex- terity. The market price modi- fier for a weapon made of morghuth-iron is +4,000 gp.

        "description":  "While the relative softness of bronze diminishes its usefulness in weapons, it allows elaborate sculpting of bronze breastplates, which makes this armor a favorite of some military commanders. It is also popular parade dress. A bronze breastplateÆs armor bonus is 1 worse than a steel breastplateÆs (+4), but its maximum Dexterity bonus is 1 better (also +4). Item Market Price Modifier Armor Equivalents For whatever reason, historical armor generally seems easier to categorize than weapons, and armor isnÆt subject to the same abundance of nomenclature that exists to describe weapons. There is therefore no need to provide equivalents for most forms of armorù there is a general understanding of what full plate or chainmail armor is, and you arenÆt likely to run across hundreds of variant names for these armors. As always, there are exceptionsùin this case, pri- marily the armor of the ancient Romans. Early Roman armor was called loricaùa hard leather cuirass similar to leather armor in RNK. The term expanded to include the three most common kinds of Roman metal armor: lorica segmentata (banded mail), lorica hamata (a chain shirt), and lorica squamata (scale mail). NEW ARMOR MATERIALS Just as mithral, adamantine, and darkwood can make fantastic armor and shields, so too can the materials described below do wonders in the hands of a compe- tent armorsmith.

See Complete Adventurer DREAD PIRATE Thugs and cutthroats in every port lay claim to the title “pirate,” but actually making a fortune through piracy is no easy task. A dread pirate, however, has mastered every aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network of contacts tells him when a particularly valuable cargo is shipping out. After a fl awless ambush at sea, he swings aboard the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand. Once he and his shipmates have overpowered the prize vessel’s crew, they liberate the cargo and make their escape. Later, the dread pirate meets representatives from the black market in some isolated cave and sells his newly acquired cargo for a handsome profi t. Some dread pirates accomplish their goals through fear, killing indiscriminately and ruling their ships at rapier-point. Others minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious sort of chivalry, perhaps realizing that the captain and crew of a prize ship are more likely to surrender if they believe they’ll live to see port again. Now and then a dread pirate takes his chivalric streak a step further and preys only on the ships of enemy nations—or even solely on other pirates.

He’s skilled at moving stealthily through all types of dungeon terrain, detecting and disarming inconvenient traps, bypassing locks, locating treasure, and fi lching protected items. The typical dungeon delver has forsaken people skills to concentrate on the nuts and bolts of dungeon explo- ration and treasure retrieval. Rogues make excellent dungeon delvers, as do the rare bards and rangers who choose to pursue this track. (Most bards would miss their admiring audiences, however, and rangers might fi nd it diffi cult to acquire all the necessary skills.) Since a dungeon delver frequently works alone, he must learn to think and act independently, relying upon no one but himself. Even when exploring a dun- geon in the company of other adventurers, he often keeps to himself-scouting ahead, disarming traps a safe distance from the group, or seeking treasure while the others are distracted. The best dungeon delvers become legends and are sought after by anyone with a particularly inaccessible treasure to recover. Some even accept regular stipends from various nobles to leave their treasures alone. Only the best dungeon delvers survive to make names for themselves, however.
