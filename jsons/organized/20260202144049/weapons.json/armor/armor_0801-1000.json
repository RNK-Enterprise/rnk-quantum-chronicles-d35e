Instead, each book 2 INTRODUCTION The old man looked up from his book as the bell above the door of his shop chimed softly announcing the entrance of a potential customer. He squinted through the accumulating gloom at a young man, well-kept and wearing the baggy robes currently in vogue for those styling themselves wizards. The aged sage snorted softly at the manicured hands and carefully trimmed beard of the lad. He had seen this sort often enough, probably knew just enough to entertain the ladies he wished to coax to his sheets. The old man muttered to himself and went, back to his reading. Curse that fool Marius, Santado thought to himself. This shrivelled old man could not possibly be the legendary Falun, tutor to half of the Red Tower mages. He just looks like a doddering old curmudgeon who would scarce know the difference between iron and apple seeds. \u0027Excuse me, sir, is there a Falun here?\u0027 Santado decided that perhaps the old man was Falun\u0027s father and might know his whereabouts. The old man blinked, \u0027Falun? Not heard that name in many years, who wants to know?\u0027 \u0027I am Santado, I was told that this Falun fellow could show me the Dark Road.\u0027 Santado smiled hopefully. The old man squinted over the jumble of vials and twists of herb-filled parchment scattered on the counter before him, \u0027Well, I\u0027m Falun, for that part of your question, but the Dark Road? Never heard of it.\u0027 Something in the way the old man chewed at his wispy moustache named him a liar. His young customer pressed further for the information he sought. \u0027It was intimated you were a guide to those seeking to travel such a path. Perhaps there is one who knows more that I have mistaken you for . . .\u0027 The old sage straightened to his full height, \u0027There is none more knowledgeable than me in any matters magical. Any who says otherwise is a liar.\u0027 The young man changed his approach, \u0027If it is a matter of money, I\u0027ve more than enough gold to pay for my instruction. Name your price.\u0027 Falun rolled his eyes, \u0027Listen, boy, you couldn\u0027t haggle your way out of an open sack and you\u0027re as subtle as a goat with gas. What makes you think you\u0027d be able to bargain with a fiend?\u0027 T made no mention of fiends. Perhaps I speak with the correct person after all.\u0027 The old man bristled and grumbled to himself, \u0027Shifty little bastard got you there you old codger. Mayhap you\u0027re getting too old for this.\u0027 The frowning sage glared at his customer and shook his head. \u0027I can show you the Dark Road, boy, but the work and the danger will be yours alone.\u0027 DEMONOLOGY - AN OVERVIEW DEMONOLOGY— demonologists are, however, prone to focus upon their studies to the exclusion of all else, unaware of I the damage they may be doing to the world around AN OVERVIEW them and just how far down the Dark Road they mayj have travelled. This is the cold, black precipice all practitioners of the art must stare in the face each T here are many misconceptions surrounding and every day of their lives. the active practising of demonology.

It immediately conjures up eventually corrupt anyone, no matter how strong images of blood-soaked rituals, of the sacrifice of they were before they started on the Dark Road.

It is I him from the nearest tree. There is much here the trap is laid. Virtually any wizard has the misunderstood of the people who choose to tread the strength and ability to summon the lesser creatures Dark Road. of the infernal planes. All it takes is access to the required knowledge. Such a wizard may call forth a Demonology, in and of itself, is not evil. A wizard nightmare to carry him a great distance with all who chooses to supplement his arcane powers with speed in order to deliver a vital message. He may the demonic is not necessarily a twisted individual, summon a small pack of hell hounds so as to aid in ; greedy and selfish, utterly consumed by his quest for the defence of a lonely village from a marauding knowledge. In all likelihood he does not, in fact, tribe of hobgoblins. There is no harm and little offer up dark prayers to the gods of evil whenever he danger in this, so long as all the required uses his magical powers. Like much in the world, prerequisites of the summoning are followed and demonology is merely a tool, no more, no less. A obeyed. But as the wizard progresses along the powerful and potentially dangerous tool, to be sure, Dark Road, he gains far deeper and blacker but there is no more inherent evil in the art than in knowledge, becoming a demonologist proper.

So it is with from the infernal planes, the demonologist will find demonology. he can reach the most powerful and malevolent of creatures. Being so close to such power is a draw to many and they may find themselves performing acts When one serves good, to hold back from using any during summonations that once they may have tool available is dereliction to the point of the found repugnant. It is a relatively simple step to affirmation of evil. using the bones of those long gone in order to summon certain species of demon. From there, where is the harm in using live animals as offerings THE PRECIPICE to demonic entities, if it is for the greater good? Where will a demonologist draw the line?

From reading ancient texts written by the their services. As the demonologist walks the Dark diabolically mad to personally facing the darkest Road, it can be exceedingly hard to avoid practices lords of the infernal planes, any demonologist who any civilised being would deem evil to the core. wishes to remain pure of heart must possess the most unshakeable resolve.

No Magic Circle can be used in a summoning immense dangers on a regular basis for questionable ritual to protect the demonologist as he calls upon gains. There is a strong belief amongst most the great powers of the infernal planes. All he has wizards that demonology is only for the most to protect him from the ravages of these evil foolish who lack the will and discipline to engage in creatures is his own force of will and his long years of study in the purer forms of magic. meticulously researched knowledge. Many fall by the wayside as they walk the Dark Road but those Even the most dedicated of demonologists know whose footing remains true can gain access to there are far safer methods in consorting with the demonic energies that far outstrip those of any beings of the infernal planes and bargaining for their mortal. services. The combined effects of Planar Binding and Magic Circle spells are the most well known The Summoning of Demons is more than mere and, indeed, offer far greater flexibility in the knowledge. It is a slippery path to hell which is all creatures called to the material world than does the too often paved by a wizard\u0027s own good intentions. demonological art. Relatively simple Summon Monster spells have the ability to call forth the Old adage from the School of Magic lesser demonic creatures and completely subject OF DEMONS, DEVILS them to the wizard\u0027s demands through the act of conjuration. AND FIENDS Demonology has its own purpose, though. It Demonology is, in its purest form, the practice of balances risk with the possibility of gaining power summoning, controlling and perhaps binding the much quicker than through either of the methods presented above. To summon and control even a dretch or imp using Planar Binding spells requires a very powerful wizard and few attain such levels of magical ability. Summon Monster spells offer a slightly quicker path but are severely limited when compared to demonology in terms of what the creature can be called upon to do, how long it remains in the material world and, indeed, the range of creatures that can be summoned. The Dark Road offers the demonologist several advantages over arcane wizardry, just as the major schools of magic offer benefits to those who specialise in their teachings. Whilst demonology limits itself purely to the summonation and control of beings of the infernal planes, it will potentially allow a practitioner to call upon the power of any of the millions that inhabit those foul places. A summoned demon will likely be under the practitioner\u0027s control for far longer than with the simple Summon Monster spells and can be compelled to perform a far greater range of actions. Many practitioners, however, are drawn to the practice of demonology for the most basic reason of all - the Dark Road offers the promise of far greater power over a far shorter period of time than arcane magic can ever grant. The counterbalance to this, and the reason most wizards distance themselves far from the practice, are the greatly magnified 5 DEMONOLOGY - AN OVERVIEW immortal creatures of the infernal planes. Many is the definition we shall use throughout this book. such planes of existence are present for Any mention of demons applies equally to devils demonologists to tap and the inhabitants of these and other fiends. hellish worlds vary accordingly. Each species has PERILS AND DANGERS its own domain, province and standing within these planes and most are grouped into \u0027families,\u0027 all bound together in rigid and complex hierarchies of In this chapter, we have covered the basic practices dominance. Some of these families are relatively of demonology in the briefest of detail. Far greater well known to the mortal worlds, as the most knowledge lies further into these pages.

Even It is important to note the rituals and magicks when summoning the most minor of demons, the detailed and explained within this book only apply practitioner is attempting to control energies far to the creatures of the infernal planes and, due to the beyond the understanding of mortals.

It will be his very soul. infernal realms. The correct collective term for all these creatures is fiends. However in common usage, most simply call them all demons and as the practitioner can use his abilities to summon any, that \u0027So, explain to me exactly why it is you initiate students in the so-called \u0027dark arts\u0027 but don\u0027t use them yourself?\u0027 Santado fingered the tomes before him, searching for something he did not already possess. This was the first time he had seen the old man in nearly a year. He had been too busy poring over the texts that Falun had sold him at their initial meeting and searching for more. The old sage shrugged his stooped shoulders, \u0027I never thought the risk was worth the gain.\u0027 The young man blinked. \u0027How can you say that?\u0027 Falun sighed, \u0027No matter which particular path on the Dark Road one chooses to follow, there is the very real possibility that something will go horribly wrong or one will find one\u0027s self committing acts that would make an eternity of the blackest torture imaginable to man seem like a spring festival.\u0027 The old sage shook his head, \u0027I value my life and my soul too much to stain either with the actions required of a practising demonologist.\u0027 \u0027But you would show others down the path you fear to tread?\u0027 Falun smiled enigmatically, \u0027That is their choice, not mine.\u0027 6 TO TREAD THE DARK ROAD To TREAD THE evil in the first place. The ends may not always justify the means. DARK ROAD Finally we come to those that most civilised peoples would call the archetypal demonologist. Cruel, twisted and utterly evil to the core, either from birth T o say it requires a rather special and unique or from having been exposed too much to the individual to study demonology is something creatures of the infernal planes, these practitioners of an understatement. Practitioners are follow the Dark Road as a means of ultimate power. marked by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, Hungry and rapacious individuals, these often in many areas of expertise. Most tend to be demonologists are heedless of the pain and suffering highly skilled in the practice and application of they cause, interested only in crushing any who arcane magic. All have an incredibly strong will, stand before them and their goals. Such goals may able to withstand the rigours and temptations their be the domination of a kingdom, the subservience of chosen art forces upon their minds. an entire race or a quest for immortality. Who can truly say what motivates such men? A SIMPLE CHOICE THE PRACTITIONERS What is often more interesting to study, however, are the reasons why an individual chooses to The art of demonology actually comprises several practice the summoning of dark and evil powers. disciplines, each specialised and focussed. The Despite all the tales told by adventurers in taverns most common is the demonologist, a wizard of and parents to their children at night, not all Arcane Lore who chooses to supplement his power demonologists are evil and twisted beings who through the actual summonation of creatures from engage in foul practices within lonely towers in the the infernal planes.

Pentagrams and their uses As with the study of demonology itself, there are many misconceptions based around pentagrams and their use within magical labours. It is a common belief, for example, that a pentagram exists to protect the wizard from malevolent spirits that he calls upon for boon and aid. There are some fields of magic, witchcraft being the most prevalent, where this holds true but for demonology the pentagram serves a much different purpose. To pull a being of any power from the distant infernal planes and make it manifest in the material world takes a tremendous amount of magical energy, the type of which few mortals are able to withstand let alone manipulate to their own ends. The pentagram used in demonology is, quite simply, a carefully constructed magical focus designed to channel and magnify a practitioner\u0027s own forces in order to build enough power during the summoning ritual to call a demon into the material world. By focussing this much energy over a relatively short period of time, the power inherent within a correctly drawn pentagram is completely expended when the summoning ritual is complete, leaving the practitioner with no protection against the creature he has just summoned other than his own knowledge and force of personality. The correct drawing of a pentagram during the summoning ritual is of utmost importance if the attempt is to be successful and the margin for error is incredibly small. Even a single human hair lying across a critical juncture of the pentagram can be enough to dissolve its power and decrease its potency, thus placing a far greater burden on the summoner who may instead benefit from saving his strength for controlling the demon rather than just summoning it. In this way, a badly drawn pentagram can have a marked effect upon the controlling process even though its power has been expended during the summoning. A demonologist cannot, of course, cast any spell or activate any magical item whilst performing either the summoning or the controlling process. He must rely purely on his demonological capabilities during these critical times. 17 THE ART OF SUMMONING - FIRST STEPS Study and Preparation demonologist will be granted a +2 bonus to both his Demonology is not an art that can be easily Summoning and Control checks. mastered by those short of memory or failing in their mental faculties.

Having studied an ancient scroll for the past five days and passing her Demon Lore check, she feels reasonably confident that she can now summon a dretch, one of the lesser Tana\u0027ri. Being her first attempt in the art, Fallora makes sure she will be undisturbed during the summoning ritual and takes her time, gaining the +2 Slow Ritual bonus to both her Summoning and Control checks. She also locates fine quality copper powder, the component needed to draw the pentagram for dretches, adding a further +1 bonus to the Summoning check. Taking four hours to perform the ritual, as she is making sure no mistakes enter her preparations, Fallora attempts to call a dretch from the infernal planes into the pentagram. A dretch has CR 2, so the check becomes DC 12. However, Fallora is a first level demonologist (+1), has an Intelligence of 15 (+2), is using high quality components (+1) and is taking her time (+2), giving a total bonus of+6, meaning only a 6 needs to be rolled. Unsurprisingly, she manages to call the dretch to the material world. Now comes the tricky bit. Incensed at being pulled from the infernal planes, the dretch would clearly like to exact revenge upon Fallora. Clearing her mind of the telepathic threats the dretch is hurling at her, Fallora attempts to control the demon. The Control check is DC 14 as the dretch\u0027s CR is doubled for this check. Fallora\u0027s Charisma of 11 adds no bonus, but being a first level demonologist helps (+1), as does her Slow Ritual (+2), meaning she has to roll 11 or more. With a breath of relief, she succeeds and gives the dretch a very simple instruction - \u0027protect me from all harm.\u0027 The dretch will now effectively act as her bodyguard for the next hour but Fallora, overjoyed at her success, wants more. She exerts her will to force the dretch to follow this instruction for another hour. There is a -2 penalty to this next Control check as it counts as being an additional instruction, so Fallora needs to roll a 13. She succeeds in this too and decides she can try for a third hour. The cumulative penalty for another additional instruction rises to -4, thus requiring a roll of 15 this time around. Unfortunately Fallora fails and the dretch breaks free of the magical bonds she placed around it. Fallora is about to learn even a dretch can be a very dangerous enemy when free. . . Anything may be demanded and the demon is every other part of this practice, there are rules that compelled to carry out such instructions to the best must be obeyed. of its ability.

All demons of this stature will also have a small number, no more than half a dozen, of greater names. These names have actual power over the demon and are thus carefully guarded by their owner. They are typically the names used by demons to bind each other into service - a demon who knows the greater name of another has the ability to summon it to grant aid, a useful survival trait within the infernal planes. Demons use this calling only in very rare circumstances for to do so leaves them in debt and they can always expect to make repayment sometime in the future.

Accomplished demonologists can also force the possession of other mortals as a means to trap the demon in the material world for longer than the summoning ritual might ordinarily allow. The subject of possession will lose all control of his body, though he remains conscious and aware. The demon takes control of his body utterly and the victim can do nothing more than watch mutely as the demon performs the most vile and hideous of acts in his name.

Possession in Action Fallora has progressed quite far in the field of demonology since we last left her. She has now achieved 4th level as a demonologist and feels ready to summon the succubus known as the Debaucheress, using research material she uncovered from the notes of an evil wizard she and her adventuring comrades recently put an end to. Everything seems to be going fine in the summoning ritual for Fallora, as always, is taking her time, using high quality components and generally doing everything she can to make sure nothing goes wrong. She easily summons the succubus but as it appears in the pentagram in front if her, the unthinkable happens - Fallora\u0027s player rolls a 1 for the Control check. Grinning with the lovely maliciousness only a succubus can muster, the Debaucheress advances forward across the boundaries of the pentagram. Fearing for her life, Fallora begins to cast an offensive spell until she realises that the demon is not attacking her directly - it is assaulting her very mind. Fallora\u0027s Wisdom of 12 will help here as her Will Save bonus is now +5. The DC of the save is 10 + the succubus\u0027 CR 9. It is a tough roll, needing 14 or more and, rolling 11, Fallora quickly succumbs to the Debaucheress\u0027 mental attack though it will only be able to control her for one hour. She is now possessed and falls under the control of the Games Master until one hour has passed and the succubus returns to the infernal planes. Fallora, as the host for the succubus, immediately gains all the demon\u0027s skills and saving throw bonuses, as well as all its special abilities, such as energy drain, alternate form and tongues. In addition, their ability scores must be averaged out between them. Fallora\u0027s scores are Str 8, Dex 13, Con 9, Int 15, Wis 12, Cha 11. The succubus\u0027 scores are Str 13, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 20. The new scores for Fallora, averaged between her original abilities and those of the succubus are therefore Str 10, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 15. Her hit points of 12 are also averaged with those of the succubus\u0027 of 33 to result in 22 hit points. Last of all, much to Fallora\u0027s consternation, she becomes physically more demonic! She starts to grow small bat-like wings and her eyes begin to glow with a sinister light. Fortunately for Fallora, the possession lasts only an hour and the succubus soon departs, though not without destroying her laboratory in which it was summoned, tearing apart her demonological notes and slaughtering her familiar which did not get out of the way in time. She loses the succubus\u0027 skills and special abilities, her ability scores are returned to what they were before the possession took place and she now has one hit point left. She regains, however, full control of her own body again. The effect, brief as it was, has unfortunately not left Fallora completely untouched for she still retains the physical likeness of a succubus. She also loses one point from her Wisdom and Charisma ability scores permanently, as well as 1000 experience points. The whole affair has left Fallora questioning whether she will continue the practice of demonology at all - in the very least she is likely to be very cautious in the art for the future. She also realises, however, that the possession could have been much, much worse. Overall, she has got off lightly. 27 THE ART OF SUMMONING - THE NEOPHYTE DEMONIC FAMILIARS As they cultivate their growing knowledge of the black art, demonologists often seek to enhance all around them with the energies they learn to control. Many will look to their own familiars, if they have one. There are many minor demonic entities that flit about within the infernal planes, all but beneath the attention of the larger demons, as ants scamper unnoticed by men. Such beings may be brought into the material world by any demonologist with the intention of possessing his own familiar. Creating a Demonic Familiar Any demonologist with a familiar may choose to possess it with a minor demonic entity at any time. Doing so takes a day and uses up magical materials totalling a cost of 500 gp. Demonic familiars function in exactly the same way as mundane familiars, with the exceptions noted below. The demonic familiar retains its original form, but will begin to look distinctly demonic in nature - a cat may grow horns or vestigial wings, for example, or the eyes of an owl may begin to glow with their own inner light. The demonic presence may be driven out by a banishment spell and similar magicks. If this occurs, the familiar automatically leaves the demonologist, as it will never trust its master again. Treat this as if the familiar had died. Familiar special abilities are granted as normal, but a demonic familiar will also gain the abilities listed below; Master Class Level Special Ability 1-2 Immune to fire and poison 3-4 See in Darkness (including magical) 5-6 Invisibility once a day 7-8 Cold and acid resistance 20 9-10 Master may speak telepathically with any creature who has language whenever he is in physical contact with the demonic familiar 28 THE ART OF SUMMONING - THE DARK ROAD THE ART OF power through more direct means.

This may be played out in one of two ways, as determined by the Games Master. The first choice is for the demon to compel the practitioner to become its agent in the material world, performing all manner of perverse and destructive acts in the name of pure evil before his soul is finally collected by the demon. The character becomes a non-player character under the control of the Games Master and may well turn into the hated enemy of the rest of the party in future scenarios. Attempting Soul Servitude The second choice is for the demonologist to A demonologist may only perform soul servitude become the very hand of evil as described above, with a named demon and he must have a demon lore but under the control of the player.

The come to collect one day. All the demonologist can do is follow the designs of his master, hoping that by proving himself capable, he staves off the cruel attentions of the demon for as long as possible. It may be hard to imagine what a demon could possibly want from the material world, especially as it is likely to be up to its neck in the convoluted politics of the infernal planes. However, demons and other immortals have always had a peculiar interest in the affairs of those on the material world, taking great delight in influencing or destroying them with mighty, awesome power. The initial tasks set before a demonologist under soul servitude are likely to be minor, petty even, as the demon weighs up its new tool. Simply visiting pain and destruction upon those nearby may be one course. Alternatively, a more practical approach may be taken, such as seeking the death of a noble knight who has too often thwarted the plans of evil, or another demonologist who has dominated many demonic allies for far too long. Beyond this, nobles may be corrupted, entire cities subverted and kingdoms toppled as the demonologist, aided by his demonic master, is compelled to build cults and followings dedicated to causing the greatest amount 33 THE DARK ROAD of destruction possible. A demon\u0027s vision of its own ambition is truly infinite and its plans will always reflect this. Just as the demonologist begins to think he can do no more for1 his master, the demon will start to relate a new set of demands, further propelling him into becoming an enemy of all that is good and pure. There are two more things to consider. First of all, demons regularly use the souls in their possession as bargaining tokens to further their own ends upon the infernal planes, always the prime concern. Being immortal, demons do not view the passage of time in quite the same way as those on the material world and the passing of a mortal\u0027s lifetime is of little moment to such creatures. However, there remains the possibility of a demonologist suddenly finding himself beholden to a far more powerful demon then he originally bargained for as his soul gets passed on, perhaps even as far as one of the very lords of hell. If this unfortunate event ever occurs, he will suddenly be confronted with an increasingly domineering master who is likely to demand a lot more from the soul servitude. Second, one day, whether it is sooner or later, the demon will come to collect its due. After the ritual of servitude, the practitioner\u0027s soul becomes the property entire of the is purely intentional. Soul servitude must never be demon. For weeks, months or years it will tease and considered lightly and is likely to result in, at least, torment the pitiful demonologist, always reminding the retirement of the character concerned.

Once the item has been successfully created, a demon must be summoned and controlled to bind it within, the binding taking place in lieu of any instructions being given to the demon. There is an additional -6 penalty to the Control check when a binding is attempted. Failure in this roll will result in the usual penalties of the demon turning upon the binder, slaying or possessing him. The materials used in creating the item will also be destroyed by this.

With the gaming session, then you can be pretty much sure he summoning time required, players are going to have will do it. This has nothing to do with demonology itself. It is a fact of role-playing. As a last word, demonologists still progress with their spells as if they were normal wizards. However, if a practitioner is concentrating on locating demonic texts rather than new magic, his spellbook is going to be rather more empty than another wizard of the same level. We would strongly suggest that once the demonologist class has been taken, you severely restrict the character\u0027s access to spells. Allow him to fill out available spell slots but ensure he does not have the huge range arcane wizards soon build up. SUMMONING AND CONTROLLING Though the mechanics governing the summoning and control of demons are of paramount importance to a player, there is actually little a Games Master should worry 46 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS Failed Control Checks Once a Control check has been failed, the demonologist is likely to be in a great deal of trouble. He is probably not too good in close combat whilst many demons are able to give even high level fighters a serious challenge. The demon, starting within the pentagram, is considered to be within five feet of the summoning demonologist. Initiative is rolled for normally and combat begins. It is important to consider the Intelligence of the demon when it becomes uncontrolled. A demon with a low score is likely to simply wade in, trying to destroy the demonologist in the shortest time possible. More wily creatures will search for weaknesses as they fight, not attempting ploys they believe the demonologist is immune to, instead using the special qualities or attacks that will cause the maximum amount of damage. Possession will only be used if the demon has a better than even chance of overpowering the summoner - after all, he has exerted his will in trying to control the demon and so it will know just how strong his mental forces are. If the battle goes against the demon, it will flee back to the infernal planes to nurture its hatred. The penalties a demon suffers from the loss of its physical form in the material world are too severe for it to ignore. Last, if other characters are present, attacks will be distributed to those that pose the greatest physical threat. The goal, however, is the destruction of the demonologist and so the demon will seek to accomplish this before being forced back to the infernal planes, either by fleeing or having its physical form slain. about here.

EVIL OUTSIDERS The rules within this supplement concentrate primarily on summoning demons and devils, as described in the Monster Manual. However, we have also made provision for any evil outsider to be summoned in exactly the same way, nightmares and hell hounds being the two examples listed on pages 54 and 55. Something of a quandary is posed here though. It is very easy to imagine a demonologist summoning nightmares and hell hounds because they are so demonic in nature.

Prior to that, there had been six months of collecting components and scouting a suitable location. These were but blinks of the eye compared to the seven years of painstaking investigation and research that had allowed Santado to set his feet on the Dark Road. He felt the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck rise as the power he controlled began to course through the carefully scribed pentagram, causing it to glow brighter. The large gold mirror in the centre of the summoning area began to glow as well. His breath fogged slightly in the pallid light, making his ancient words nearly visible as he chanted. Santado felt the Power tear at his will, trying to force itself free of the restrictions he had put on it. The luminosity of the pentagram and runes throbbed in time with his chant casting eerie shadows that brought to mind the silhouettes of hanged men on the walls of the chamber. As Santado finished his incantation a loud thunderclap echoed through the summoning chamber accompanied by a noxious cloud of thick yellow smoke. The demonologist clapped his hands bringing forth a breeze that tattered the bilious fog, clearing the air and revealing the demon he had laboured so diligently to summon. Hunched in the centre of the casting circle squatted a huge, misshapen figure. Large cloven hooves glinted dully in the waning light of the pentagram. Its powerful ursine body was matted in thick fur bristling into a shaggy ruff that covered the massive shoulders and neck. The head of the demon was that of a gargantuan boar with three sets of gleaming, razor-sharp tusks. Santado had never imagined the demon would be so huge though he had read hundreds of descriptions of the bloodthirsty nalfeshnee. The demon rested its sharp taloned paws on its knees as it looked around the chamber. \u0027What soul-bearer calls me?\u0027 The creature\u0027s voice grated against Santado\u0027s ear sounding like a combination of crumbling rock and tearing metal. The demonologist swallowed past the growing lump of fear in his throat and forced strength into his voice. Any sign of weakness now would lead to his swift demise. T do.\u0027 The demon\u0027s lip curled with disgust. \u0027You, little man? Who are you to summon me?\u0027 Santado smiled, \u0027You\u0027ll not get my name so easily. You may call me Master.\u0027 The nalfeshnee\u0027s hackles bristled as it rose to a crouch. \u0027Think you that this puny barrier will hold me? Watch your words, human.\u0027 Santado allowed himself a smug smile, \u0027True. The circle cannot hold you, but my knowledge of your true name will, Epok.\u0027 The demon cringed and scowled, \u0027What did you call me?\u0027 \u0027Your true name - Epok.\u0027 The demon\u0027s muzzle split in an unholy grin, \u0027That is not my name, little braggart.\u0027 Santado\u0027s eyes went wide. His stomach lurched as he felt the Power surge unchecked around him as the nalfeshnee stood to its full height. \u0027B - but the texts . . .\u0027 \u0027That is not my problem.\u0027 61 DESIGNER\u0027S NOTES DESIGNER\u0027S further disfigurement?

If the prerequisite ascendancy features required that the character devote spell slots to unlock them, applying the template frees them, as those features are now an intrinsic part of what the character is and no longer need the arcane energy to sustain them. The character can use those spell slots available again. Once the character applies an ascendancy template, he can never apply a second one. If he is willing, a wish or miracle can remove the template but he also loses the ascendancy features he had previously unlocked that are part of the template’s prerequisites. 4488 ASCENDANCY – PRIOMORDIAL BLOOD",

Dragons have all the features for free already. 5588 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS The chieftain of the Half-Moon Fang kobold clan was uneasy. His explorers had warned him that something was coming to the caves from the direction of the green dragon’s lair but that it was neither a dragon nor a party from the human king’s army. They just had not seen it, and it had evaded detection and capture as if it knew the layout of the clan’s traps in the forest. A few years ago he had the clan’s shaman killed, accusing him of betraying the clan to some outsiders when the real reason was that he began spouting some nonsense about a ‘chosen one’ coming to lead all kobolds to victory. He scoffed and peered at the sun coming through the trees in its last throes before it sank below the horizon. ‘Find anything interesting, chief?’ A voice from the forest startled him. ‘I suppose you are waiting for the in- truder into clan lands.’ ‘Guards!’ The small reptilian called as it drew its bone dagger, taking a couple of steps backwards. ‘They are all dead.’ The voice informed him politely. The chieftain knew that the voice was another kobold but its accent was strange. Only once had he heard his language spoken with such… finality. The owner of the voice did not let him ponder much longer, as it emerged from the foliage. A kobold all right, young too and it bore the markings of the Half-Moon Fang but the chieftain did not recognize him. ‘Hold.’ The stranger said with an unusually deep voice, and the chieftain found that he could no longer move. ‘Fear.’ The other went on. The leader of the clan began shaking, his teeth rattling in his skull but he was unable to escape. ‘You should see yourself now.’ The strange kobold approached disdainfully. ‘Unfit to lead, trembling at the sight of a youngling, eh?’ Ah, I will answer the question in your mind… I am Killi’vaurr, whom you gave to the green dragon Verrthwynn under our shaman’s advice. Guess what? You are not rid of me.’ ‘D-dragon?’ The chieftain’s eyes looked nervously at the first stars of the night. ‘Hee, hee…’ The kobold sorcerer giggled. ‘Do not worry about Verrthwynn. He is dead. He taught me just enough for me to see the path ahead. I had some adventurers find his lair and kill him, and then I killed them while they recovered from their wounds. Do you know why your explorers did not report anything about my coming? I bought them with the dragon’s gold, and they now work for me, the same as the Cleaved Horn clan and Hurwatt’s orcs upriver.’ ‘What do you want…? I give it to you! You take it!’ Killi’vaurr grunted. Had he really spoken like that once? Now he understood why Master Verrthwynn was so annoyed at him. Several kobolds from his own clan had approached at the noise of his entrance to their homes. He saw some of his childhood friends and some of his clutch-brothers among them, and he smiled wickedly. With a single word, he unleashed a volley of energy bolts that pierced the paralyzed chieftain. ‘I take your life, and I take the clan.’ He said before turning to the rest of his former clanmates. He made his eyes glow with the power of his heritage, which leant towards red dragons rather than the greens. ‘Attention! I am Killi’vaurr and I am now your leader! I come to lead you to a new age for kobolds! We are dragonchildren! And we will take what has been long-denied to us! Riches, power and glory!’ There was much cheering from the reptiles. Killi’vaurr smiled again. Another stone was set in the foundations of his reign. 5588 59 DESIGNER’S NOTES Designer’s gram in my notebook to determine the proportion of limbs and other body parts in relation to the beast’s size.

The counterweight buckets are hauled into the air by a winch system and held in place by a latch. The light trebuchet, by contrast, uses a bulb-shaped counterweight built into the swing arm. This arrangement makes the light trebuchet significantly easier to use than the heavy trebuchet but limits its range and can make the engine unstable if it’s not winched or loaded properly. Loads of shot launched by a heavy trebuchet deal damage to all creatures within 2 squares of the target square. Loading a light trebuchet requires three full-round actions. Loading a heavy trebuchet requires six full-round actions. Reaiming a trebuchet requires four times as long as loading it, and the weapon cannot be reaimed while it is loaded. If the check to load a light trebuchet fails by 5 or more, the weapon tips over, dealing 4d6 points of damage to all crew members (as well as any other creatures adjacent to it).

AERIAL BOMBARDMENT Many siege weapons hurl large objects, such as boulders, through the air to smash down upon the enemy. However, armies that deploy airborne troops can transport weighty objects into the air and drop them more directly upon foes.

Flyers with clumsy or poor maneuverability need to remember to leave themselves enough maneuver- ing room to avoid crashing into the ground or target (see page 20 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). VOLLEY OF ARROWS In most battlefield situations, archers don’t pick par- ticular targets for their shots. Instead, large groups of archers concentrate their shots on an area occupied by enemy troops, ensuring by sheer volume of projectiles that something will be hit. Despite the name of this tactic, it can be attempted by any characters wielding projectile weapons, such as crossbows or slings. The rule presented here originally appeared in a simpler form in Complete Warrior; this information updates and expands on that material. If at least ten archers are in a contiguous group (each one adjacent to at least one other), they can loose a volley of arrows as a full-round action. Rather than aiming at a specific target, they concentrate their arrows in a general area, hoping to hit whatever’s there. Each archer fires a single arrow, regardless of her normal rate of fire. The commander of the archers (generally an officer or trained for such missions, troops under the effects of a fly veteran soldier, who need not be one of the archers himself) spell, or a creature flying with a stack of rocks on a carpet makes a special attack roll against AC 15, using only his of flying.

In this way, the general’s advisors become just as much a part of the battle- planning as she is because of the strategic advantage they provide. Some terrain features can also provide a localized strategic advantage, for those attacking or defending. In game terms, a strategic advantage does what its name suggests: It gives an advantage to one side in a battle. Mechanically, this advantage is represented by the awarding of victory points (see page 78) before the start of battle. Most strategic advantages are gained through planning before the battle even begins, though some can be gained even if battle is joined without a plan, such as if an enemy force DEFLECTING A VOLLEY is ambushed.
