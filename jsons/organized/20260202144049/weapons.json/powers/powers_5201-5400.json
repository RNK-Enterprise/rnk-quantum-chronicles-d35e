Parrillo SHADOW ELEMENTAL Shadow elemental The shadows coalesce into a single point of pulsing animated darkness. Trailing smoky wisps of gloom, the vague form moves soundlessly closer, draining the light as it passes. Shadow elementals are creatures of living shade, brought into being from the stuff of the Plane of Shadow. Appearing as nebulous forms of ever-shifting gloom, they lash out at living creatures with smoky tendrils as insubstantial as the darkness. These elusive creatures rarely roam the Mate- rial Plane of their own free will; when they do, it is almost exclusively deep underground, where light has never touched. More frequently, they manifest as servants summoned from the Plane of Shadow. Although they are not harmed by light, it causes them considerable discomfort, and they do all they can to escape or snuff out the hateful illumination. Similarly, shadow elementals fi nd the presence of living beings not native to shadow to be disturb- ing, although not nearly to the same extent as they do light itself.

A fatigued character can’t run or charge and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity until he has rested for 8 hours (or until the wound damage is healed, if that occurs fi rst). Additional wound damage doesn’t make the character exhausted. In addition, any time an attack deals wound damage to a character, he must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 5 + number of wound points lost from the attack) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. (During that time, any other character can take a standard action to help the stunned character recover; doing so ends the stunned condition.) 0 Wound Points Wound points cannot drop below 0; any damage that would cause a character’s wound point total to drop below 0 simply causes the character to have 0 wound points. syekaL yb .sullI 620_88156_UnearthedArcana2.indd 116 12/11/03, 2:16:40 PM 117 ADVENTURING CHAPTER 4 At 0 wound points, a character is disabled must attempt a regaining consciousness, at which point he becomes disabled.
