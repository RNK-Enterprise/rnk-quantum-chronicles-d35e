The to discover it, as well as a quick escape route for the hags sahuagin could not stand up to the combination of sea should they need it. elf armies with human merchant economic support. Their armies were defeated and their holdings fell. The elves expanded into the abandoned sea bottom, wrecking the sahuagin’s palace and homes. The ancient temple of Sekolah, however, was protected by powerful magic that kept the elves from destroying it as well. Its 190 8 RETPAHC ERUTNEVDA SELACOL priesthood fled, but the buildings and precinct remained. Elf patrols stood guard around the ancient site to prevent its evil from growing again. Now that the hostile sahuagin had been replaced by a friendly regime, the human traders were able to exploit the spice islands to the utmost. The elves had little inter- est in activities above the waves and were content to continue the trade in pearls and other undersea goods in exchange for food and exotic luxuries from the above-sea world. Both groups prospered for the next two centu- ries, while the remnants of the sahuagin tribe dispersed into small enclaves of raiders that posed no real threat to large fleets. The prince of the sahuagin had been killed in the war, but the high priestess of Sekolah escaped, along with a few acolytes. She swore that her people would one day reclaim the sacred place. This priestess, Naatrigitt, considered it her religious duty to keep the order alive. She established a retreat for training the most promis- ing candidates in the history and rituals of Sekolah’s worship. This temple-in-exile was a poor substitute for the glorious complex of old—a shabby, dark cave scooped out of a dead coral reef—but it was still the spiritual center for the scattered sahuagin exiles. Over the generations, each new high priestess took the name of Naatrigitt, leading the efforts to restore their people’s ancient greatness. As the centuries passed, the sahuagin slowly regrouped and plotted, while the high clerics of Sekolah kept alive the flame of hatred. But their numbers were far less than those of the now-thriv- ing elf kingdom, which enjoyed a population of many thousands and the continued support of the human traders. The sahuagin could only bide their time and wait for the right moment. That moment came a year ago, when a powerful sea- quake struck the Glittering Banks. The entire seamount subsided, burying sea-elf homes and killing thousands. In a moment, the elves’ most important source of food and trade goods was gone. The mighty kingdom had suddenly become an impoverished horde of starving refugees. The human traders provided some assistance, but they could not feed so many. The traders had also become complacent, seeing no need to support the elves as strongly as in the past, since they believed the sahuagin threat had long since vanished. The elf rulers could no longer control an extended empire—every able-bodied adult was needed to rebuild the capital and to search for food. Guarding the old sahuagin city, on the fringes of the elf kingdom, seemed quixotic in the circumstances. Over the next few months, the sea elves abandoned the site. It took a while for the sahuagin to realize what had happened. Their rangers and scouts had been watching the elves for generations but had never seen a sign of 191 LOCALES ADVENTURE CHAPTER 8 weakness. Now reports came to the sahuagin court-in- (sahuagin who look like aquatic elves; see page 218 of the exile that the sea elves had abandoned their watch on Monster Manual), but a more diverse group is possible if the old city.

Alternatively, the adventure site might be in a region previously uncharted by the dominant nations of your campaign, providing an opportunity to open up a new adventuring area. A simple way to introduce this adventure is to have the PCs be among a group of mercenaries who have been hired by the traders to deal with the emerging sahuagin problem. A more sea-oriented theme would be to have the PCs either be sea elves themselves or other aquatic peoples (aventi, darfellans, merfolk) coming to the aid of the elf kingdom, so that they are intimately involved in the outcome of the struggle. For a twist, have the PCs come in on the sahuagin’s side. After all, the sahuagin had been established there for centuries until the humans interfered, bringing them into conflict with the aquatic elves and costing them their city. It’s easy to change the tone of the set- ting by making the human merchants more grasping and manipulative and the elves more like pawns.

So, think about taking some schools, with Greater Spell Focus in one or more, possibly general feats first. with Spell Penetration and feats that enhance both spells A wonderful feat for both sorcerers and wizards is Spell and ranged weapons.

More than ever before, your ability scores determine how well you take and deal damage of all types. Since cat’s grace and endurance help any character, a sorcerer may decide to pick up one of these first, given his limited spell selec- tion. Bull’s strength is least useful to a spellcaster, but if the combat specialists in your party can count on you to enhance their Strength scores, you can count on them to protect you more effectively in a melee. Among the 2nd-level spells, invisibility is a great boon to wizards and sorcerers alike, especially if there’s a rogue in the party. Wizards also benefit from learning see invisi- bility early on, but the sorcerer’s limited selection makes that a spell he might want to skip until later. As your list of 2nd-level spells grows, consider hypnotic pattern (good for taking foes out of the fight or distracting potential foes without actually doing any harm) and levitate. No spellcaster can do without dispel magic, and it should definitely be one of your 3rd-level spells. A sorcerer may prefer fireball, lightning bolt, or fly as his first choice, but this one deserves to be the next. Its uses are legion: You can bring spell-using enemies down a notch by eradicating their ability enhancements, magical protections, and even their antimagic spells with a good roll. Good troubleshooting spells at 3rd-level include suggestion, invisibility sphere, and tongues. You also have some excellent party support spells to choose from, such as the amazing haste. Higher-Level Spells Once you have built a repertoire of 1st- through 3rd-level spells, you should have a pretty good idea of the type of character you’re playing. Sticking to that theme makes picking higher-level spells straightforward, although you can always shift your focus. to adventuring also have a variety of high-level spells Wizards available.
