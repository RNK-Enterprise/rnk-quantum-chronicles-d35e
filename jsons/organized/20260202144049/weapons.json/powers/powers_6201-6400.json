scoundrel . Scoundrels can be wildly different characters, including Bilbo Baggins, Robin Hood, Han Solo and Princess Leia, Sherlock Holmes, Zorro, and Lara Croft . All of them live by their wits, take chances when they must, and land on their feet against all odds . Each has a distinct personality and goals, from solving crimes to committing them, but these characters’ methods and outlooks, not their profes- sions or morality, make them scoundrels . As personas for characters, scoundrels represent a style of play rather than a class . They’re the sneaks, the cheats, the bluffers, and the opportunists . They use improvisa- tion and imagination to gain an advantage, exploiting a weakness or a hidden benefit in even the worst situation . Anyone can play a scoundrel . Simply adjust how you prepare for encounters, react to situations, and interact with both NPCs and your fellow PCs . Lawful or chaotic, sword-swinger or spellcaster, scoundrels come in all types . Scoundrels are also fun and valuable tools for DMs . Whether a skilled but unreliable cheat the PCs can never be sure about, or an entire guild of trained sneaks and thrill-seekers, the scoundrel archetype might enhance a campaign in any number of ways . The versatile new feats, skill tricks, spells, and equipment presented in this book might be just the way to spark a party’s imagination and inspire new tactics . By the same token, putting these features in the hands of an opponent NPC allows you to confront even the most experienced player with something never seen before . WhaT’s InsIde Like earlier entries in this series, Complete Scoundrel is a resource for players and DMs who wish to add elements of this book’s theme to their game . Chapter 1 introduces the concept of the scoundrel . What does it mean to play a scoundrel, and how can you best craft your scoundrel character? This chapter explores the archetype in detail, giving players and DMs a primer on incorporating the rest of the book’s elements in their roleplaying . The following chapters present new abilities and options for scoundrels of all sorts . Chapter 2 details prestige classes, while Chapter 3 offers many new feats to exploit a situation to the fullest . Chapter 3 also introduces two new rules subsystems: skin-of-your-teeth luck feats and an exciting way to enhance your skills with special tricks . Chapter 4 presents a variety of new spells designed with the scoundrel in mind . Chapter 5’s selection of new equipment—including alchemical, magical, mundane, and even living items—offers an array of useful gear for characters who seek the right tool for every job . Chapter 6 discusses the scoundrel adventure or cam- paign, including how to challenge characters who live noITCudorTnI Introduction “It’s locked,” Lidda said, backing away from the heavily bound iron door. Its hundreds of etched demonic faces leered at her. “Of course it is. That’s your job. Deal with it,” prodded Regdar, his armor clanking as he shifted impatiently. “I can’t. It’s not locked like that. Hennet, you want to give this one a try?” “Pardon me,” the sorcerer whispered as he squeezed past Regdar, whose wide frame filled most of the tight hallway. Stepping in front of Lidda and gesturing his companions back, Hennet flamboyantly produced a wand, a flimsy thing little more than a gnarled twig. He closed his eyes and concentrated for a moment to summon the power inherent in his blood, then focused on the wand. A silent wave of blue sparks washed over the evil-looking door, but as they struck its surface they vanished like rain upon warm stone. “It’s beyond the wand’s power,” Hennet stated matter-of- factly as the blue light faded. He turned back, skirting past the fighter. Regdar looked to Lidda with an exasperated shrug. “Well, how do we get by?” “We look for another way.” Annoyance tinged Lidda’s voice. “I could try something,” chirped Gimble from the rear. Disbe- lieving eyes turned toward the brightly dressed bard. With his hands stretched out ahead of him, the gnome forced his way past his doubtful companions. He tossed Lidda a jaunty smirk and a quick raise of his eyebrows as he met her level gaze. “A little room, please,” Gimble said in serious tones, mocking Hennet’s dramatic pose. The others stepped back as he put his back between them and the door. The gnome reached into his cloak for a split second, then pressed his hands against the door and began whispering slowly, ominously. Regdar glanced at Hennet, who arched an eyebrow dubiously. Their misgivings quickly gave way to surprise, though, as a loud creaking echoed through the web-strewn hall. The heavy door swung inward at the gnome’s push. “How’d you—?” Lidda started. “Old gnome trick.” Gimble waved his arms toward the entrance like the most gracious host. “After you.” As his companions passed by cautiously, Hennet fixed the gnome with a sidelong look. Gimble hung back a moment. Deftly, he slipped the palmed stone with its sinister demon face—just like the ones on the door—back into his cloak. He’d found it a few rooms back and pocketed it in case it might prove useful, as it had. Skipping after his allies, Gimble smiled. They didn’t need to know. That was the old gnome trick.
