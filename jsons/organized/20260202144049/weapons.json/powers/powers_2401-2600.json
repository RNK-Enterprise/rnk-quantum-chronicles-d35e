Because their enemies are as determined to end their violent activities as the Scars are to continue them, the Scars remain constantly on the move and rotate their stronghold between several safe houses on a regular basis. The Scars are intimately familiar with Pal Ador’s exten- sive sewer system, which allows them to move undetected throughout most of the city. However, the age and labyrin- thine design of the sewers means that they are not very safe, and it is not uncommon for the Scars to fi nd monsters and patrols in the murky depths. The sewers are riddled with secret passageways, long-forgotten tunnels, and hidden strongholds of other underworld factions. The man responsible for raising the Scars to their cur- rent level of infamy is a shadowy half-elf named Mezriss. Raised on the unforgiving streets of Pal Ador, he quickly took to a life of crime and joined an ordinary criminal gang who called themselves the Scars. Mezriss assassinated the former leader through a slow, insidious contact poison hidden in a magnifi cent crown that he presented the leader “as a gift of respect.” Once he took over, Mezriss changed the scope and mission of the gang, turning it from a ragtag group of thieves to a highly effi cient band of assassins and criminals, bent on revenge for the inequality and humiliation they suffered for being half-humans. Over time, the inner cabal of the Scars was replaced solely with half-elves.

In truth, however, one’s fi rst impression of a dwarf is usually deceiving. Dwarves come from a very closed environment, with little in the way of personal space or privacy.

Their pranks, jests, and insatiable demand for story and song are reminiscent to other races of a child’s short attention span and constant demand for enter- tainment. Those who make such hasty judgments, however, only show their ignorance of the gnome mind. Gnomes are a long-lived race. Adulthood does not come until forty-five years of age, and gnomes usually live to see at least 350 birthdays. In fact, it is not uncommon for a gnome to celebrate five hundred years of life, though few survive much past that age.

Feral garguns also enjoy the company of halflings, valuing their success at maintaining a nomadic lifestyle. Feral garguns some times see halfl ings as mentor fi gures because of this attitude—a role that most halfl ings fi nd both amusing and appealing. Feral garguns hate giants.
