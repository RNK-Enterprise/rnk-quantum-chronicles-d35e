The bugbear’s nose is the cause of its name, though the creature is not related to bears. Its hide and sharp claws also resemble those of bears. A bugbear’s hands are far more dexterous than a bear’s paws, however, and its claws are too small to make effec- tive weapons. Bugbears speak Goblin and Common. COMBAT Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents whenever possible. When hunting, they normally send scouts ahead of the main group that, if they spy prey, return to report and bring up reinforcements. Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.",

As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually bright- ens until the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal. Silver dragons are sometimes known as shield dragons because of the silvery plates on their heads. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until in the oldest the eyes resemble orbs of mercury. Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks or amid the clouds themselves. A faint smell of rain always accompanies them. Even in clouds, though, the lair always has a mag- ical area with a solid floor for laying eggs and storing treasure. Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and they often have mortal com- panions, even forming deep friendships. Inevitably, however, a dragon resumes its true form and departs for a time. Silver dragons have a taste for human cuisine and can live on such fare indefinitely. Because they lair in similar territo- ries, silver dragons and red dragons often come into conflict. Duels be- tween the two varieties are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the upper hand by working together against their foes, often with human allies.
