For example, the market price for a +3 longsword is 18,315 gp, but you can make one in nine days for only 9,315 gp, plus some experience points. Make liberal use of this benefit by manufacturing the best weapons and armor you can and using them with pride. Don’t be afraid to sell your weapon-making skill to your adventuring companions either. If you make items for your friends, you can give them a 20% or 30% break on the market price and still keep a comfortable profi t for yourself. You rarely want for money or equipment, since you can make the items you need and support yourself through your craft. Largely for that reason, the guild doesn’t supply cash or items to its members at all. However, the clerics of Moradin hold your skills in the highest regard, so you can expect a 25% discount on spellcasting services or cleric-crafted magic items in the Soul Forger’s temples. In exchange, you are expected to lend your considerable skill to crafting weapons and armor for Moradin’s servants from time to time.

The origins of this organization are as shadowy and sin- ister as necrocarnum itself. Few know of its early days, but those who do whisper of an ancient and powerful creature that taught the fi rst necrocarnates their craft and drew them together. Necrocarnates believe that this being still exists and serves to this day as the driving force behind the union, guiding the hand of Akker Zemd. On the rare occasions that they speak freely, these sages of necrocarnum lore claim that the shadowy master behind the union desires nothing less than the destruction or corruption of every mortal soul. Some claim that it is a powerful lich—the last survivor of some long-dead empire who has been driven insane by millennia of undeath. Others insist that the union is just another facet of a plot designed by the devious mindfl ayers, and still others hint that some powerful demon lord or evil deity is behind the organization. But whatever its origin, the union is clearly a force for utter evil built on a mutual lust for power. NPC Reactions Only evil creatures ever have friendly attitudes toward necrocarnates. In normal society, they are shunned and even hunted by those who understand the evil that they represent. Even people who do not understand necrocarnum or the evil nature of its use are repulsed by the twisting, haunted visages that swim visibly beneath the surface of every necrocarnum meld. Necrocarnates wishing to enjoy the comforts and resources of ordinary civilized cities must conceal their activities, refrain from shaping necrocarnum melds, and deal only with closely trusted associates or servants too cowed by their power to oppose them.

Your philosophical viewpoint dictates your position on the war. If you are inclined toward good, you favor working against the demon lords at all costs; if you are inclined toward evil, you prefer to curry the favor of the evil princes in hopes of gaining a reward in this life or the next. If law is your cause, you strive to prevent the chaotic demons from gain- ing a foothold in the bastions of soul energy; if you lean toward chaos, you oppose the mindless destruction that the demons represent while remaining sympathetic to the cause of chaos.

If you wish, you can try to contact the Last Watch and offer to work with its members to battle the demon lords; they will direct your power to where it is most needed. If you are inclined to join the battle on the other side, the demon princes will be more than happy to accept your aid as well.

Thus, your tactics change throughout an encounter to refl ect the shift of power from your spells to your soulmelds. Your ability to bind your soulmelds to your chakras significantly increases your versatility. Some soulmelds might become constant companions for you. In such cases, you must strike a balance between your favorite soulmelds and your spells with respect to essentia investment, and that balance might change throughout the day. As a high-level soulcaster, you need never lack for essentia since you can sacrifi ce your spell slots to power your soul- melds on a temporary basis.

Umbral disciples can serve as spies, assassins, or wan- dering troubleshooters, depending upon the nature of their septs. An evil sept might secretly amass infl uence, eventually becoming the power behind the throne in a strife-riven kingdom. A neutral sept might simply serve as a conduit for information about the adventurers’ evil nemesis, or its members might accept payment from that same nemesis to punish intrusive heroes. Daily Life Since umbral disciples are wanderers at heart, they place little importance on material wealth and creature comforts. Because an umbral disciple travels lightly and often, it’s a rare day when he awakens in the same town as he did the previous day. Occasionally, however, he might be ordered by his sept master to serve a particular person or cause, sometimes for months or years at a time. Septs accept commissions for various kinds of activities and provide personnel to carry them out. For example, a sept might be retained by a powerful noble house to pro- vide a guard for one of its important members, to supply a suitable spymaster to advise the leaders of the house, or to hide an important person or item in the safety of its hidden fortress. When not actively working on an assignment, the mem- bers of a sept are expected to contribute to the organization’s storehouse of information. All members are exhorted to take a keen interest in the affairs of the people around them and report their discoveries to their superiors, who add that knowledge to the sept’s wealth of hoarded information.

Such a portal is called a vortex, and it usu- ally connects to an elemental or energy plane. In such cases, the conditions are similar on both sides of the portal. A vortex to the Elemental Plane of Fire might be found at the edge of a volcano, while one to the Elemen- tal Plane of Water could be found off the coast. The great- est dangers of such vortices are that native elemental life can cross over easily, and a traveler may suddenly find herself in another plane without intending to be there. Unlike a mundane doorway, it is usually impossible to step halfway across or reach through a portal. You are either on one side or the other. Reaching through a portal has no effect on the other side until you pass most of your body through—and then you’re on the other plane. “Just sticking your head in” won’t help you determining what is on the other side of an opaque portal, but divination spells such as analyze gateshould prove very useful. Spells do not pass through portals. Divinations do not reveal anything about the other side of the portal unless specifically noted by the spell.

Many of the creatures that roam Bytopia are celestial versions of animals and beasts found on the Material Plane. Axiomatic creatures (see Chapter 9) are less common but found here as well. In general, gentler crea- tures live on Dothion, while wilder beasts and more savage creatures live across the gap on Shurrock. The primary deity of Bytopia is Garl Glittergold, deity of the gnomes. He has a whole community to help him manage his portfolio. His team of “able assistants” includes Baervan Wildwanderer, tender of the forest; Baravar Cloakshadow, master of illusion and deception; Flandal Steelskin, paragon of metalsmiths; Gaerdal Iron- hand, the gnomes’ battle general; Nebelun, muse of invention and discovery; Segojan Earthcaller, tiller of the soil; Callarduran Smoothhands, emissary to the deep gnomes; and Urdlen, known only as “the greedy.” Garl Glittergold’s divine cohorts make their home on Bytopia, in a region of Dothion known as the Golden Hills, although Callarduran is often visiting the deep gnomes on the Material Plane, and Urdlen claims part of the 399th level of the Abyss as his home. As a result of Garl Glittergold’s presence on this plane, most of Bytopia’s petitioners permanently assume the form of gnomes regardless of their race in mortal life.

Here, steep valleys flank the river, which surges through narrow passages. Eventually the mountains diminish and the river spreads into a great marsh alive with insects and reptiles. This is Belierin. Finally the bottom of the marsh deepens and the traveler passes into the fourth layer of the plane, Thalasia, the headwaters of the Oceanus among the Isles of the Blessed. While the Oceanus flows between the layers of the plane, it is not a straight journey. The great river splits into myriad smaller flows, recombines, and splits again. Occasionally an offshoot of the river curls around and reenters the layer it just left. Vision on Elysium is just as on the Material Plane at that particular time of day. Elysium shares a day and night cycle with the Material Plane and has similar (if gentler) weather. The days are warm and calm, the nights cool and comfortable. The nights are also alive with small lights.

Krigala The Beastlands’ top layer is Krigala, split in two by the River Oceanus. The river flows through the layer in a strong torrent, flanked by verdant forests that often bridge the great river with intertwined branches above. Small side channels depart from the river, and there are numerous bayous and oxbow lakes formed whenever this extraplanar river alters its banks. Krigala is a land of eternal afternoon. A warm sun basks the land in its continual glow. It is just warm enough in Krigala for the plant life of the area, and tem- peratures remain in a comfortable range unless manipu- lated by spells or divine will. Time passes normally but is not tracked by the moving of the sun. Instead, gentle rains drift in on soft breezes once per day. More rarely, occasional thunderstorms strike, sending many of Krigala’s beasts to cover. The centaur deity Skerrit lives in Krigala with his clos- est petitioners.

They can also be wondrous palaces made of crystal and white marble with golden towers, as befits the deity of such a noble race. Corellon Larethian’s tower is the latter type. Festooned with colorful banners, it dominates the surrounding countryside. But only elves and Corellon’s allies are per- mitted through its doors to share in the song and feast. Corellon’s Court: Corellon has divided some of his duties as deity of the elves among members of his court. Sehanine Moonbow wields power over death and dreams, Hanali Celanil is the paragon of love and beauty, and Labelas Enoreth is the administrator of time. Aerdrie Faenya is the master of air and weather, Erevan Ilesere is behind much of the court’s mischief, and Fenmarel Mes- tarine is the ambassador to the wild elves. Finally, Deep Sashelas is the deity of the sea elves. Aquallor The second layer of Arborea is an eternal ocean. It is like the Elemental Plane of Water, and indeed there are vor- tices between the two. But unlike that Inner Plane, the layer of Aquallor has both a surface and a bottom. At its lower reaches, it’s as black as night. Aquallor is the home of Deep Sashelas, the deity of the sea elves.
