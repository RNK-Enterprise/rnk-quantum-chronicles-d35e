The rock and ice of this “temple” have been hollowed out by hand to form a vast cavern with a permanent roof of ice hundreds of feet thick and a warren of tunnels and chambers leading off it. Cultists make their homes, such as they are, in these smaller chambers. Fire pits with crude chimneys cut into the rock allow cultists to keep themselves warm despite the year-round freezing temperatures. A nearby coal deposit provides fuel in the treeless wasteland they inhabit.

The fl oor drops away to a depth of 30 feet. Nearly two dozen 5-foot- wide pits pock the fl oor, each sealed with a grate of black metal. Thousands of snakes writhe and slither along the fl oor, and although they crawl across the pit gratings, they never slide down inside. Five balconies overlook the fl oor, one in each corner and a fi fth against the center of one wall. Graceful bridges extend from the balconies to a fl oating circular platform in the center of the room, on which looms a large stone statue of a headless snake. TACTICS The viper swarms should be little more than a nuisance to high-level PCs, but the real menace is a considerable threat. Zuvexus is Seghulerak’s cohort, and when her mistress is in the Reliquary, it is the marilith’s duty to serve as warden. She waits patiently, hidden inside the illusory statue of Sertrous in the middle of the room. She can see through the illusion with her true seeing ability. When the PCs enter, she attempts to summon 1d4 hezrous. She then drinks a potion of barkskin +4. In the third round, she uses project image to place an image of herself on one of the corner balconies, then uses her spell-like abilities to harry the PCs, creating blade barriers and using telekinesis to force PCs through the barrier and off the balcony. When forced into melee, she uses her wand of haste and activates a dervish dance. Then, with the aid of air walk, she takes advantage of her high speed and ability to make full attacks while moving.

But his fiendish blood became apparent even in his youth, when he grew claws and fangs to match those of the forest’s denizens. His heritage became an issue among the druids, and Varro was spurned by them shortly after completing his training. He fled to the city, believing that rejection by the druids was rejection by the natural world. The rats, bats, and other animals of the city found a kindred spirit in the angry druid, and soon Varro took up a new calling. Now he watches over what might be the most hostile environment of all: civilization. Rat-catch- ers, exterminators, and anyone else who delves too deeply into the city’s sewer tunnels never return. Taken in by Khalili (see above), Varro acts as spymas- ter and advisor to the thieves’ guild. Varro’s army of urban animals forms an effective spy network, one that even the best rogues can’t match. Every cat is eager to tell tales of its master if properly bribed with a bit of fish, and bats overhear much when they’re hanging from the rafters. Characters who threaten the rats of the sewers or the bats of abandoned warehouses might draw the ire of Varro, who is cruel to anyone who threatens his flock. The PCs might be sent into the city by the Druids of the Three Acorns to offer Varro a chance at reconciliation.

SILVARR, THE VENERABLE SAGE “If I’d known I would live this long, I’d have taken better care of myself.” Silvarr has bested all enemies but the most ancient and deadly—age. Now a venerable elder, he is pushing the limits of the natural human life span. He has outlived all his fellow adventurers, three wives, four children, four- teen grandchildren, and seven familiars. Silvarr has devoted the last forty years of his life to various schemes to keep his mortal existence intact. He loathes the prospect of undead eternity in lichdom, and having visited the Outer Planes, does not like what he’s seen of the afterlife. He would rather remain alive, in his present body, for as long as he can. Silvarr is a ancient, lean scarecrow of a man, his white hair worn in an ornate braid down his back, his blue eyes still clear and brilliant. He dresses in robes of an archaic cut that were fashionable a century ago. He is truly near- ing the end of his life and loudly regrets any activity that keeps him from his ultimate goal of not dying—at least, not anytime soon. Silvarr is a hypochondriac and a magic missile (12th-level caster); permanent spells on complainer, particularly before he casts his morning’s self—comprehend languages, darkvision, detect magic, spells (see below); he is crotchety and irritable on the tongues. best of days.
