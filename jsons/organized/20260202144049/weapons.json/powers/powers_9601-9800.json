It’s a gargoyle, but it begins the encounter using its freeze ability so that an observer must make a DC 20 Spot check to notice it is alive. The southern alcove holds a sculpture composed entirely of chains that vary in size and shape, ranging from extremely thin and razor-sharp to thick and mounted with barbs, spikes, and blades. It has a vaguely humanoid shape, but until it begins moving, it is impossible to distinguish it from an inanimate collection of iron.

TACTICS The chain golem delays until the portrait has had a chance to attempt to hold the PCs. Then it activates its chain barrier ability, moving slowly forward to mow down PCs. The chain golem won’t shred the gargoyle or the portrait if it can help it. Also, it won’t follow PCs who leave the landing. It always remains within the confi nes of the landing and alcoves. On its turn, the gargoyle rushes the closest PC and engages with that character to the exclusion of others. Unlike the portrait and the chain golem, the gargoyle follows the PCs to the best of its ability if they attempt to fl ee, attacking until it is slain or it van- quishes the PCs. 149 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR KK4477 Gargoyle CR 4 HP 45 ___________________________________________________ CE Medium monstrous humanoid (earth) Init +2; Senses darkvision 60 ft.; Listen +4, Spot +4 AC 16, touch 12, flat-footed 14 HD 4; DR 10/magic Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +4 Speed ft. 40 ft.(8 squares) Melee 2 claws +6 (1d4+2) and bite +4 melee (1d6+1) and gore +4 melee (1d6+1) Base Atk +4; Grp +6 Special Actions freeze Abilities Str 15, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7 Feats Multiattack, Toughness Skills Hide +7 (+15 when against stone background), Listen +4, Spot +4 Freeze (Ex) A gargoyle passes as a statue when not moving unless observers succeed on a DC 20 Spot check.

Each imp attempts to use its suggestion power on the same PC (pref- erably a PC with a low Will save such as a fi ghter type, for instance), suggesting the affected PC turn on his com- panions.

Impale (Ex) A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its barbed body.

Use this encounter when the player characters fi rst enter the top of this tower. Because each step is two feet below the level of the next, PCs can likely see into the tower room before they fully ascend. If any PC steps on the last step adjacent to the fl oor of the northtower room, the circle of death trap triggers. After the trap triggers, apply the results of the trap and roll initiative. It is likely that in order to reach this area, the PCs had to defeat Rafail and four vampire spawn in K60A. In this case, the vampires returned to their coffi ns in this area to heal. Unless the PCs were very slow to come to this area, these vampires will still be recovering when the PCs arrive. There are other guardians, however. A vampire spawn (marked as V on the map), a forsaken shell (F), and a shadow (S) keep watch over these coffi ns.

Both can move freely through the webbed areas. The spiders target opponents that have been immobilized (partially or fully) by the webs, trying to poison and further weaken them. The ettercaps follow similar tactics, targeting those already caught in the webs. They prefer to concentrate on PCs who have already been poisoned by the spiders, delaying their actions in some cases to do so. AFTER THE BATTLE After the PCs dispatch the monsters, they can search the area. This requires that they clear away the webs (probably by burning them). Under the webs, the PCs fi nd the rotting remains of long-forgotten chests that once held the personal items of the long-dead guards. There is only one item of interest, which is found on a DC 20 Search check. One chest holds half of an untarnished silver key. The word “Key” is etched on it. When joined with the other half (found in K55), the complete “Portal Key” opens the door to vault 12 in area K84. T M D ACTICAL AP ETAILS Details on the tactical map are described below.

The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Web (Ex) An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based and include a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire. Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire. An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web. Skills Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. 9955339933772200__CChh0044__EEnncc..iinndddd 116699 77//2266//0066 77::5533::3366 PPMM K Q IINNGGSSMMEENN UUAARRTTEERRSS Encounter Level 9 Use this encounter with the room entries on page 111.

The deathreap ooze attacks any PC within 15 feet of its vat with a slam, taking advantage of its 15-foot reach. It never leaves the vat. If two or more living creatures get within 10 feet of the vat, it uses its negative energy burst (which heals the bloodhulks). The Necromancer’s Bargain The PCs and the Necromancer might negotiate.

A melded skin kite can be struck with a weapon or grappled. To remove a melded skin kite through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the skin kite; doing so peels off the creature but also deals 1d6 points of damage to the attached victim. Steal Skin (Ex) A skin kite steals its foe’s skin while melded, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage each round. For each point of Charisma stolen, the skin kite gains 1 hit point.

The whirlwind is 10 feet wide; the catacomb ceiling prevents it from getting larger or wider. Whirlwinds do not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature’s space. A Huge or smaller creature takes 2d6 points of damage unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind. It must also succeed on a second DC 16 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 2d6 points of damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a DC 16 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful.

This encounter begins when the PCs bend low to read the epitaph on the fallen door to Crypt 7, move to enter this crypt, or attempt to open Crypt 8. CRYPT 7 Two wraiths (W) lurk in the shadows of Crypt 7. The spectre Endorovich (S) hides in a secret subcrypt, waiting to emerge to destroy any living creatures that disturb the area. If the PCs disturb this crypt fi rst, the wraiths emerge from the shadows and act in the surprise round. PCs who make a DC 21 Spot check notice the spectral forms and also get to act in the surprise round. On the second round of combat, Endorovich moves through the wall to attack the PCs. Read: The fog swirls and a blast of grave-cold air heralds the arrival of something terrible from the depths of the crypt. You hear an otherworldly voice call out, “Slaves, attend me!” Endorovich waits 1 round so that the PCs become fully invested in the wraith attack. On the second round of combat, he emerges and moves toward any cleric he can see (fi rst choice) or any other obvious spellcaster (second 184 choice). With his energy drain, Endorovich can make enemy spellcasters lose their highest-level spell for each successful negative level he bestows.

Named for the two long, wickedly barbed horns that grow from their heads, they are a menace to any creature they might perceive as food—a category that includes most anything that moves. Their home plane is Acheron, but bonespears have spread throughout the planes and can be found in even the most inhospitable climates due to their natural hardiness. Bonespears resemble large grasshoppers in shape. Their dark, carapaced bodies are 8 feet long, and they stand nearly 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Their heads are capped by a pair of 3-foot-long barbed horns. Only when the creature begins to hunt does it become appar- ent that the horns are not firmly attached to the crea- ture’s head—long sinews connecting the head and the horns enable the bonespear to launch its horns at prey and reel them in to be consumed. Bonespears can sit for days on end, waiting for suit- able prey to wander by. They typically choose barren, rocky places to conduct their hunts, and many bone- spears lair underground.

The true form of a darkweaver resembles a spider in only in the vaguest fashion. Its fleshy, gray-skinned body is divided into two segments, each with four tentacles. Clus- ters of spiderlike eyes cover all sides of its front section, and the underside contains a mouth with deadly fangs. A darkweaver usually walks on all eight tentacles, but it can rear its front section up and move about, which frees its front tentacles to attack foes or manipulate objects. Darkweavers speak Abyssal, Common, and Infernal. 39 DARKWEAVER another creature would have one-half concealment, and a creature in the shadow strands 20 feet away would have total concealment. A creature in the shadow strands has no concealment from creatures within 5 feet.
