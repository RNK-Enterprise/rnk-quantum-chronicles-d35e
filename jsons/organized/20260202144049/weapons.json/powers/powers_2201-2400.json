HALF-ELVES AT WAR In general, half-elves see war as a necessary evil that should be confronted promptly in order to get it over with. A half-elf at war strives to combine human effi - ciency with elven grace. The result, embodied in a half-elf who is properly trained and equipped for war, is a combatant with an austere fi ghting style that wastes no movement and dispassionately dispatches foe after foe. Half-elves learn martial techniques and receive training in whatever military traditions are prominent in their home society. Elves are trained from an early age (relatively speaking) in how to handle a blade and a bow; most half- elves receive the same training. The techniques of the elves emphasize quick, darting moves, rapid swordplay, and hit-and-run tactics that take advantage of their keen senses, quickness, and reaction time.
