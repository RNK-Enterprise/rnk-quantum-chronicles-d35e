The glacier flows from the surrounding heights, a slow-motion river of snow and blue-white ice. What lurks among the snowdrifts and rocky outcrops? Background for the DM The Winter\u0027s Heart Glacier is so named for the icy winds and blizzards that blow from it starting in late autumn of each year. The foul weather from the glacier is a natural phenomenon. Local legends, however, attribute the icy seasonal winds to a being called the Frost Warlock, who reputedly sleeps in the heart of the glacier through the summer and emerges in late fall to send bitter cold and snow into the lowlands. This legend has some basis in fact, as we shall see below. The Setup The Winter\u0027s Heart Glacier winds some 19 miles through mountainous terrain. The glacier\u0027s width varies between three and five miles throughout its whole length. The surrounding mountains might be high or low (see page 90 in the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide), as appropriate for your campaign. The glacier begins in a high slope about 15,000 feet above sea level and drops to about 5,000 feet above a valley at its lower end. All nonacclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at this altitude. A character must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or be fatigued. The fatigue ends when the character descends to an altitude with more air. See page 90 in the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide for more information. As one might expect, temperatures on the glacier are cold -- between 0° and 40° Fahrenheit during the day, and 10 to 20 degrees colder at night. This exposes creatures to cold or severe cold as noted on page 302 in the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide. When temperatures are above freezing, the whole glacier is subject to avalanches (see page 90 in the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide). Whenever the weather is clear and sunny, the glacier\u0027s ice and snow gleam brilliantly in the sunlight. As mentioned in Frostburn on page 12, the glare can partially blind creatures with unprotected eyes (a veil, dark goggles, or a blindfold or cloth mask with slits cut in it provide protection). An unprotected character must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 10, +1 per previous attempt) or go snow blind. A snow-blind character takes a -2 penalty to AC, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC and moves at one-half speed. The snow-blind character also takes a -4 penalty on Spot checks, Search checks, and any other check that relies on sight and a -4 penalty on most Dexterity-based checks. In addition, all other creatures have concealment (20% miss chance) against the snow-blind character. Snow blindness lasts 1d4 hours, or 1 hour after the afflicted character enters a dark or shadowed area. (A remove blindness spell can remove it.) The PCs might have to cross the glacier while traveling in the mountains, or one of the following events might draw them there. A party of mountain climbers or hunters has vanished on the glacier during a storm, and the PCs are recruited to rescue them. The missing characters might have fallen into a crevasse and become trapped, or perhaps they have fallen prey to the monsters on the glacier. Alternatively, they may have become guests of the satyrs living near the glacier (see below). The PCs hear rumors of a great treasure lost in the mountains centuries ago. Recently, bits and pieces of this vast hoard have turned up at the base of the glacier, apparently carried down to lower altitudes by the flowing ice. This treasure might indeed be part of an ancient cache lost near the top of glacier, or it could merely be the abandoned hoard of some monster. In any case, Jusii, the genie of the glacier (see below) resents attempts to explore the lower glacier. The PCs are traveling during a cold snap, and they awake one night to find an invisible hand tracing frosty artwork on their windows. It\u0027s Jusii, playing Jack Frost (see below). If the PCs inquire about the incident, they hear the legend of the Frost Warlock and his lair in the Winter\u0027s Heart Glacier. Exploring the Glacier Though mostly just snow and ice, the glacier has some noteworthy features, as described in the boxed text below and in the sections that follow: Sharp, rocky peaks rise majestically all around. Through this rugged vista winds a long ribbon of ice and snow that gleams a brilliant white in the sunshine like a river of pale silk. Here and there, the gaping cracks and jagged ridges break the smooth surface, looking like frozen rapids in a great river. Ridges and Drifts (EL 12) These areas form where the glacier flows over rough terrain and the ice buckles. The resulting pressure ridges rise between 5 and 20 feet high. Climbing over them requires a DC 5 Climb check. Snow also tends to drift around the ridges, creating areas of soft, deep snow about 2 feet thick. Creatures of Medium or smaller size suffer hampered movement in the drifts, as follows. (See page 12 of Frostburn for more information.) A Small or smaller creature must pay 4 squares of movement to enter one square in the drift. The Tumble check DC for a Small or smaller creature increases by +8. A Medium creature moving in the drifts pay 2 squares of movement to enter a square, and its Tumble DC increases by +2. Areas of ridges and drifts often occur near areas with crevasses, and vice versa.",

        "description":  "During the day, the frost worm lies buried in the snow, watching for prey. When it spots a potential meal, it looses its breath weapon, then charges and bites. It continues attacking the same creature until that foe drops. Once its chosen prey falls, the worm trills and tries to pick up the fallen prey and carry it off. Otherwise, it fights to the death. At night, the worm prowls the surface, trilling as it goes. If it encounters prey, the worm tries to carry off a stunned victim. It looses its breath weapon if attacked or pursued. Crevasses (EL 9) In areas where the glacier passes over high points on the terrain underneath, the ice stretches and breaks, forming crevasses 2d4x10 feet deep, 4d12x10 feet long, and 1d8x10 feet wide. There is a 25% chance that a crust of snow covers any crevasse, creating the appearance of an unbroken surface. The crust, however, can support only 8 pounds. A character approaching a hidden crevasse at a normal pace is entitled to a DC 10 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don\u0027t have a chance to detect the crevasse before they reach it. A character falling into a crevasse may attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to catch the edge, in which case he falls prone in a square at the edge of the crevasse. A crevasse\u0027s walls have a Climb DC of 18. A crevasse often occurs near areas of ridges and drift and vice versa.",

        "description":  "The satyrs spend their days playing their pipes, dancing, and occasionally tormenting Jusii. They\u0027ve given the genie the nickname \"Jack Frost\" because of his penchant for working with ice and snow. When the satyrs notice newcomers on the glacier, they\u0027re quick to test their mettle. Their favorite ploy involves an ambush of sorts. The satyrs form a circle along the newcomers\u0027 line of march and hide themselves as thoroughly as they can. Assume they \"take 10\" on their Hide checks, each gaining a +2 bonus for their careful preparation. When their quarry enters the circle, all the satyrs leap out of hiding and play their pipes. Drotius picks a character and uses his fascinate bardic music power. Initially, the PCs will have some difficulty recognizing where the magical attack is coming from, or even that they\u0027re under attack. If the characters suspect something, a DC 10 Spellcraft, Knowledge (arcana), or bardic knowledge check reveals that bardic music is in play, and a DC 16 Spellcraft, Knowledge (arcana), or bardic knowledge check reveals that the ability is fascinate and that Drotius is using it. If Drotius succeeds in fascinating someone, he then tries to make some kind of embarrassing suggestion, such as doing a chicken dance, making snow angels, or the like. If either attempt fails, Drotius starts again, with an attempt to fascinate someone else. If the party becomes violent, the satyrs try to protect Drotius by getting between him and the PCs, firing their bows at whatever targets seems best. In the meantime, Drotius uses his pipes to create a fear effect, then casts Tasha\u0027s hideous laughter on whoever looks most dangerous among those who escaped the fear effect. After that, Drotius uses inspire courage, and all the satyrs try to withdraw from the fight. They use their high speed to get away and their bows to discourage pursuit.

However, there are a few important distinctions, plus some new spells, feats, prestige classes, equipment, and more material designed specifically with the Ghostwalk campaign in mind. RULES FOR GHOSTS This section describes the general rules for handling ghosts in the Ghostwalkcampaign. SOULS AND GHOSTS Every living thing has a soul—the essence that is not tied to its physical body. When a creature dies, its soul continues to exist and eventually passes on to the after- life. Less intelligent or self-aware creatures, such as most animals and some magical beasts, have very weak souls, and when they die, their souls immediately enter the realm of the dead. Most other kinds of creatures’ souls lack the special qualities necessary to remain on this side of the afterlife and become ghosts. Aberrations, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, giants, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, outsiders, plants, shapechangers, undead, and vermin simply pass on to the True Afterlife when they die, although some kinds of magic may allow their souls to temporarily remain as ghosts. Some of these creatures accept this as the natural order, but others envy humanoids their strange gift and seek to eliminate them. Unlike animals or most other types of creatures, intel- ligent humanoids have unusual souls that are capable of enduring outside a living body for an indefinite time. These disembodied souls can remain indefinitely, exist- ing as ghosts.",
