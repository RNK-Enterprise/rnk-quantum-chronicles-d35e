When they say sacrifice, they mean the sacrifice of a living, intelligent crea- ture. Commonly, the victim is a humanoid, but dark powers might demand the sacrifice of anything from a medusa to a giant to a beholder. The main criteria are that the creature be alive and have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. The sacrifice must be made in a ritualized manner. ItÆs fine for a blackguard to say that he is dedicating every foe he slays to Vecna. But in truth, Vecna appreciates and rewards his followers for victims killed in a ceremony and at a place dedicated to him. This means that the ritual takes time, and it probably involves extra participants and unholy trappings (for examples of sacrificial gear, see the executioner tools and other equipment in Chapter 3). In a world suffused with magic, evil gods pay attention when someone makes a living sacrifice to them, and they often reward their followers for doing so. In some abstract sense, the sacrifice adds some small mote to the godÆs over- whelming power, and in return the evil deity is sometimes willing to grant a boon or a blessing in return. SACRIFICE REWARD SYSTEM The reward a servant of an evil god gets for making a living sacrifice to the god depends on many factors. The primary factor is the Knowledge (religion) check result of the char- acter performing the sacrifice. Each of the other factors is represented as a modifier to the check. Each evil deity has his or her own predilections and pref- erences for sacrifices, and different deities give different rewards to their followers. The following system of sacrifices and rewards is just a starting point; give each evil power in your campaign its own unique sacrifices and rewards. 26 :2 RETPAHC TNAIRAV SELUR 620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd 8/13/02 10:38 AM Page 26 pqs WHAT IS A SACRIFICE? Sacrifice is the offering of the life of a sentient being to an evil deity or powerful fiend. The victim is trussed, tied, or otherwise immobilized so that a ceremony may be conducted that culmi- nates with the murder. In many rituals, blood is a sacred symbol of life. When that blood spills during the ritual murder of an innocent creature, the blood (and sometimes even the soul of the creature) is dedicated to a nether power of malev- olence. Bloodless forms of killing, such as strangulation and drowning, are possible during sacrifices, but usually those that are despicable enough to practice this profane art prefer bloodier deeds. pqsTable 2û1: Typical Sacrifice Elements Table 2û2: Typical Sacrificial Rewards Knowledge Check (Religion) Result Effect Sacrifice Element Modifier 15 Aid upon the celebrant for 24 hours.
