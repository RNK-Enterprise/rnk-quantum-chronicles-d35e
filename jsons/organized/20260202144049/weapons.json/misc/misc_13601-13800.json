MONSTROUS FIGHTERS AND MONKS A bugbear stands guard at the entrance to an evil monastery. Dismissing the creature as a minimal threat, the experienced adventurers rush the gate. Before they are fully aware of what transpires, the bugbear erupts into a flurry of unarmed attacks, strik- ing with the deadly accuracy of a high-level monk. “WHAT?”, shout the players. Why not? Bugbears have above-average Strength and Dexterity scores, and their Wisdom is no worse than human average. If their culture were more ordered and stable, bugbears would make excellent monks. Nevertheless, a savage society does not prevent an occasional bugbear—or a gnoll, minotaur, or even an ogre mage—from being trained in the path of the monk. Some of these monsters excel at this discipline. Fighters are even more common among monstrous kinds, though Warriors (an NPC detailed in the DUNGEONMASTER’s Guide) and Barbarians are the likely choices for the military-minded among them. Still, an orc who puts aside his savage nature to study the maneuvers and tactics of the expert fighter is not to be 61 discounted. His brute strength, combined with a fighter’s access to feats, makes him a deadly foe.

If using this ability? my character gets it only when defending his charge, does No. Nor does the character threaten the area around him. this mean that it applies only for harm’s way?

My character uses both ranged and reach weapons. The Pain Touch feat from Sword and Fist makes an A devoted defender gets a dodge bonus to Armor Class opponent the user has stunned with a successful stunning when actively defending her charge from attack (see Table 2– attack nauseous as well. What is a “stunning attack” and 2: The Devoted Defender in Sword and Fist). The DM is free what good is making a foe who’s already stunned to define “actively defending her charge from attack,” but the nauseous? general intention is whenever the devoted defender is within In this case, “stunning attack” is a successful use of the 5 feet of her charge. There are conditions when the character Stunning Fist feat from the Player’s Handbook or the monk’s will be denied a dodge bonus despite sticking with her charge stunning attack power. Opponents who fail their saving (see page 119 in the Player’s Handbook). A devoted defender throws are stunned 1 round, as normal, then nauseated for 1 never gives her charge an Armor Class bonus, although the round after that. (See page 280 in the Player’s Handbook for devoted defender’s harm’s way and deflect attack abilities the effects of nausea.) can keep attacks from hitting her charge. The prerequisites for the Pain Touch feat are base How is the ghostwalker’s painful reckoning power attack bonus +2 or more, the Stunning Fist feat, and a supposed to work? Sword and Fist says that you get this Wisdom of 19+. The Stunning Fist feat itself requires an bonus after you lose 50% or more of your hit points in an attack bonus of +8 or higher, so aren’t the Pain Touch initial encounter. Does this mean that if my character is at prerequisites in error? 50% or less hit points in the middle of a fight, I get this In this case, no. The monk’s stunning attack counts as a bonus for the remainder of the fight?

Lightning Fists actually isn’t a very good attack.

Supreme cleave lets you step between cleave attacks, but you still can step only once. If you have the Snatch Arrows feat, can you use it only In the case of Cleave, “immediate vicinity” means within once a round, like the Deflect Arrows feat? Or can it be melee reach. A character using supreme cleave can first take used multiple times in a round? a 5-foot step to determine who is within melee reach before As the feat description says, Snatch Arrows works exactly choosing a target for a cleave attack like Deflect Arrows, except you catch the missile instead of just deflecting it. You can try to catch one missile each round, and if you do so, you cannot also try to deflect a missile that same round. Say my monk has the Snatch Arrows feat and the Throw Anything feat. Can I catch an arrow or bolt and throw it back at the attacker? No. The Throw Anything feat allows you to throw a weapon. Ammunition is not a “weapon” for this purpose. Nor can you throw something that is not a melee weapon, such as a bow or crossbow. How often can you attempt Feign Weakness against one opponent? Does the Bluff check take a standard action or is it a free action? You can use Feign Weakness as often as the DM lets you. You might want to add a +5 to the foe’s Sense Motive check for the second and further attempts against the same foe on the same day. Using Feign Weakness is a standard action, just like a feint (see the Bluff skill description on page 64 of the Player’s Handbook), except that if you succeed you get to make your attack immediately. Does the fighter with the Knockdown feat get a free attack from Improved Trip against a creature that he trips due to a knockdown? No. If you have the Prone Attack feat, can you regain your feet as a free action if you don’t attack? Technically, Prone Attack only lets you get up for free if you make a successful attack.

In thisway,through stealth chambers, often with females to attend them. GOBLIN SOCIETY and surprise, goblins can eliminate a more powerful foe over time. Over the centuries, goblins have interbred and intermingled with other tribes, in captivity and in the world. The race has, therefore, developed a remarkable tolerance between goblin tribes. When two goblin tribes meet, the stronger tribe may assimilate the weaker, often after only minor bloodshed. Individual goblins from the smaller tribe will need to establish their place in the hierarchy of the tribe. Once they are part of the tribe they will be treated as any other goblin (i.e. poorly). The reason for this tolerant behaviour may have its roots in the racial tendency to congregate and the belief there is safety in numbers. Whatever the reason, it is more often better to merge than to compete for the same limited resources. SLAVERY Slavery, for the purpose of labour, ritual sacrifice and food is well established in goblin society. Slaves are most often the result of encounters with small groups of other races. Goblins almost never enslave other goblins and most larger and monstrous races prove difficult to control. Most slaves tend to be gnomes, halflings and humans. Isolated homesteads and small caravans can yield prisoners but it is unclear why slaves are taken in one raid and not in other, similar forays. Goblins rarely They were in complete blackness. Saremknew the spell, as the halfling had seen Thurm cast it many times. She had heard the goblin shaman chanting but was unable to interrupt the spell. Now the same shaman or another had brought a magical silence on the room. Surely the creatures were searching the darkness for her and her friends now. Luckily for her, she was small enough to get around unnoticed. What was really a concern to her Were the black wolves she saw just before the darkness had overcome them. Surely they could smell ber? She quickly fumbled in her pack and foundwhat she sought: a bag ofpowdered hot pepper! She cast it about randomly, hoping to throw off their trail and made her way to where shehad seen the secret door open earlier. She came upon a warm pool on the rough floor. As she probed further, her blood went cold: it was Thurm! By his wounds it was clear she could not help the cleric. She recalled just the previous day he had saved her own life by healing her terrible burns. Suddenly, shooting pain lanced throughher leg as a goblin spear pierced her. Instinctively, she stabbed upward and felf her sword sink deep. The vile creature slumped beside her. before they Leaving her lifeless friend, she reluctantly continued. When she reached the secret door beyond the silence and darkness her spirit soared: Tabithiaswas waiting! She ran to the mage and, after securing the door behind them, the tWo fled down the passage. Still under the influence of the darkvision spell, Sarem led the pair and Tabithias, blind in the dark, stayed close. It was only a fewmoments heard the secret door crash open behind them.

Down on the hadal environment. Even if they could be brought to the 7 HABITAT We know, of course, that the kraken can never walk on land. He is a creature of the deep, and we would no more expect him to enter into our towns than we would an octopus. But I tell you now of a legend that was related to me by my master, some forty years ago. There was a kraken of immense age and power. He had lived in the sea, building his petty empires and molesting ships for centuries. He grew in magical knowledge until, at last, he mastered the art of shape-changing. Can you imagine the intellect, age and sheer brute power that it must have had to achieve such a thing? This kraken, calling himself ‘The Emperor of Life and Death’, travelled as a human among the coastal towns. At first he did not settle, but his power was obvious. The vain, the evil and the needy were all attracted to his following, and soon he had an entourage whenever he appeared, even while yet damp from the ocean waves. He had the population around there worship him in his aspect as the gigantic sea beast, and a great temple was erected in his name. Wealth flowed in and death flowed out. Terrible tales of sacrifices and profane rites escaped the region. He surrounded himself with luxury and opulence. He fathered many cursed offspring, and he cast his gaze on the cities inland, and dreamed of a continental empire. In time, the king of that land felt the need to take action. Auditors were dispatched but never returned. Champions followed, but fared little better. Mercenary bands caught wind of the festering boil on the coast and they tried their luck, few survived to tell the tale. In desperation the king called on his barons to provide troops. Strong sorcerers from neighbouring lands were offered rich rewards to join in the extermination effort. This war started in the spring, and ended two years later, resulting in vast stretches of that once-fertile coast being laid bare, and with the loss of several thousand lives. The temple was pulled down stone by stone, the surviving captured worshippers were sold into slavery on the galleys, as they were good for nothing else, and the victorious troops were issued awards that even now adorn their regimental banners. Thus the kraken was defeated, destroyed, and his remains cremated. But that is not the end of this cautionary tale. Of the offspring of that creature, most were born hideously deformed. They lived out their squalid lives lying in foetid pools, lashing out with their tentacles and bellowing at passers by, fed on the remains of profane sacrifices. The conquering forces dispatched them, skewering them where they lay. But a tiny few were not so obviously afflicted; they could live on both land and in the sea, half man and half squid, they slapped into the waves to feed, but then returned to continue their depredations on anyone they found. Many were captured and released from their curse at the point of a sword. Others, however, and no one knows how many there were, escaped. A few may not have even known that they were such monstrosities – appearing normal at birth, spirited away by their mothers, perhaps only realising their curse later in life. It is a brave party that camps on that stretch of shore even today. Especially when the tide is running high, and the nights are dark. – Excerpt from a lecture given in the Academy of Sages, Bhängphôt. surface without suffering the bends they would these is the first overhanging cave, which is over 70 probably not survive the in the ‘thin’ atmosphere. feet in diameter, with the others ranging in size down to a mere 10 feet in diameter.

This endless production line of creation is not entirely pointless, however. In its leisurely, eternal swim through the elemental Though the Kraken seldom, if ever, interferes in the plane of water, the Kraken leaves behind it a wake of affairs of the mortals in the material world, it is new life.

It avoids other gods that also batch of creatures. Thus, local stocks of fish and other creatures are assisted in replenishing themselves. Also, like all of the other gods, the weight of immortality and the loneliness of divinity can weigh heavy on the mind – even one so clearly unbiased by temporal matters. To cope with the lonely vigil of filling the seas with one’s own children the Kraken maintains a large retinue of avatars. These creatures, each representing a small portion of the god’s own divine force, swim along with it and sing songs telling it how boundless, fertile and wonderful it is. Each avatar is a duplicate in miniature of the god and produces offspring in 10 KRAKEN SOCIETY great quantities. Sometimes these avatars are sent as forms of action in response to external events. ambassadors to other deities, at other times they are Some, particularly those physically close to the god, sent away to different parts of the plane altogether remain true to the outlook of non-interference. and advised to fill that area with life.

When the characters agree to fetch these items, he reveals that he needs the ink, blood and hide of a freshly-slain kraken. He offers to pay the characters 150% of the standard market price for such items (as detailed on pages five and six of this guide), as well as covering the cost of any healing and/or raising the party may require. As a twist, the alchemist could actually be the kraken in question, using it’s established cover identity to lure in a fresh meal. Unsuitable Liaison A nobleman approaches the party to retrieve his daughter from the clutches of a kidnapper. All he knows is that she was last seen heading out of town towards the coast a couple of days past, and has not been seen or heard from since. He assumes it has something to do with a youth his daughter was involved with, as he also has not been seen since he was thrown out of the town a week prior.

The all, made them extremely rich. Antangillians are passage from the hillside was revealed at the same now not a welcomed people along the coast, time as the appearance of the kraken. Now the High 20 ANTANGIL Approaching the island of Antangil by sea, the visitor is immediately impressed by the large and well- protected natural harbour. Prevailing winds carry shipping past the island at most times of the year and it is only a short diversion to make this gentle port. Clearing the heads at Punta Baja moves the ship into the calm bay, where fifty ships could easily ride at anchor, and at least five will be doing so at any given time. Rising behind the docks is the city of Avarua, which straddles the relatively gentle slopes up Mount Anelgauhat. From the perspective of the sea however, the modest tree-covered peak seems mighty and imposing. Half way up the slope, directly above the city, the visitor cannot miss seeing the mighty temple of the kraken. This structure stands several storeys high and appears to grow out of the hillside itself. Eight broad, winding staircases lead down from its single main portcullis, and each of these staircases reminds the viewer of the tentacles of a mighty squid. In fact, the entire structure looks very reminiscent of a gigantic sculpture of a squid, half sticking out of the rock, the main gate resembling a toothed mouth, the upper works taking the shape of an extended, bulbous head. Each tentacle-staircase leads into a different section of town. The architecture of the city can be clearly divided into three styles. The first are the simple wooden cottages, which still reach to the foreshores of the bay and are ubiquitous in this part of the world. The second are the more impressive, two-storey wooden mansions of the trading families, which again can be seen gracing the overlooking hillsides of any maritime nation. The third type is clearly recognisable, and is reflective of a society that has recently gained much in the way of material wealth, but little in the way of taste. These nouveau riche monstrosities are composed of imported stone and exotic wood, and occupy large tracts of land. Each is designed to be more ostentatious than it’s neighbour, consuming an entire acre with little regard to garden or harmony with nature. Inside, one supposes, they are the very models of refinement, comfort and modern convenience. But to this humble travel chronicler, they are monuments to gauche excess. On reaching dock, the traveller is accosted by the numerous guards who seem to swarm about the place, all heavily armed. They pry into one’s business and demand to see papers, if you have any, even though you could only have arrived on an Antangillian ship. To say that security is tight is not too much of an overstatement, though as long as you carry yourself as a person of some importance, and have some clear task on the island, you are generally allowed to move on without more than a 15 minute delay. The visitor at this point onwards is well advised to make himself meticulously familiar with the labyrinthine laws that apply nowadays in the republic. The slightest infraction of these complex, and sometimes bizarre, statutes will land you in jail, and there is no shortage of ‘good citizens’ who will happily inform the authorities of your offence. No fear need attend incarceration concerning being maltreated, as apparently the spacious cells are comfortable and prisoners are well treated. Of much greater concern is that many who are thus imprisoned are simply never seen again. One cannot help but be impressed by the apparent richness of the city and of its inhabitants. All appear well dressed and fed, and the streets are wide and well maintained. Buildings are clean and in superb repair, and the discerning shopper can find virtually anything they might want from sources across the world, though the prices are considerably higher than on the mainland. Lodgings can be found, every bit the equal of the best inns and hostels of the mainland, and the service is second to none, as long as one is prepared to tip generously. Only one note of discord can be detected in this otherwise cosmopolitan city, nearly everyone appears sombre, distracted and nervous. They are wary of striking up animated conversations with visitors, and constantly look over their shoulders (metaphorically speaking), as if they fear that they are being eaves-dropped upon. Despite this uneasiness, the seasoned traveller can still find the kinds of establishments that enthusiastically provide the type of ‘entertainments’ that the lonely and adventuresome seek. Outside of the city, the country folk still maintain that kind of easy friendliness which the island used to be noted for. – Extract from The Observer’s Guide to the Sea Nations. 21 ANTANGIL Priest and his cronies guard the entrance to this called to the session when directives are made.

However, it is usually daoine marriages that few produce more than about another fifty years before the young daoine is five children in all that time, though the female may brought fully into their society, leaving the family start as many as twenty pregnancies. Many children die in infancy too. All this makes pure-bred daoine children a rarity, though anecdotal evidence suggests that males and females both have greater success with raising children with non-mist elf partners - though this is never acknowledged by the formal marriage of the parents. It is extremely likely that estimates that the mist elf population is 10% smaller now than two centuries ago are understating the decline of the purebred population. Personality Despite being aloof and enigmatic, the caricature of the mist elf as an obsessive loner - which owes much to the attitudes of the grey elves, with whom the mist elves are often confused because of their gravitas and nobility - is a long way from the truth. Mist elves are lively, gregarious and witty; it is just that they feel that only others of their kind will appreciate their culture. Mist elves are motivated by challenges. 6 7 SOCIETY OF THE MIST ELVES SOCIETY OF THE MIST ELVES On reaching maturity, it is normal for a young and form close relationships with dwarves, humans, daoine to seek out some kind of personal quest, be halflings and gnomes. it intellectual or physical, and to devote decades to its completion if that is what it takes.

More typically, a mist elf community will exist as a small town of perhaps a thousand or two thousand souls, which can either be a focal point and cultural centre for a web of small villages of another elf sub-race, or will be on the edge of such a grouping, and largely remote from it. These towns and smaller settlements are called cairns, and each features a small monument which was erected on the day the community was founded. In such a remote town, or in one of the more accessible cairns dominated politically and culturally by the mist elves, even then there might be only a few hundred actual blood daoine. The rest of the population will be half-elves of all kinds, acting as craftsmen, traders, farmers and the like, and then a leavening of another elven race. The port city of Heljian is a good example. The most northerly elven port on the seaboard, Heljian is both part of the neighbouring kingdom of the sea elves, but is also effectively politically independent.

This Chaotic behaviour is never destructive or wild, however, and most mist elves are Chaotic Good. Generous, warm, amusing and brave, mist elves find evil almost inexplicable. Why would anyone want to have the bards sing such dark songs about them? Philosophy Separate to their religious beliefs, mist elves also have a reverence for natural and metaphysical philosophy. In fact, most of their great kings, military leaders, heroes and bards have had a philosophical aspect to their character, and the sayings of great people are held as universal truths, with as much gravity and power as the commandments of the gods. There is an intrinsic fatalism and sadness in daoine philosophy, a tragedy which relates to their physical through which religious truths are revealed. This position in the world. The decline of mist elf matters even more than practical applications of numbers, which has not yet quite led to a diminishing clerical magic, though great skill is applauded in this of their place in the world (or the elven parts of as in any other area. it, in any case), has led to a gradual loss of self- confidence.

They feel that time is coming soon. 10 11 SOCIETY OF THE MIST ELVES SOCIETY OF THE MIST ELVES Driven by this sense of a coming end, mist elves are Daoine prefer individual combat. More than that, at once prone to melancholy and lethargy, scarcely they adore the structure of the challenge or duel, able to stir from their cups, and then driven by where everyone witnessing the fight knows the incredibly energy, by a need to achieve all that can names of the participants, understands whatever rules be done, before it is too late.

In the Legend of Porras, he refuses to take up a powerful shield he finds at a forest shrine, since he has done nothing to ‘earn it’, and continues to bear the shield he won in combat, and which is etched with runes that tell of his deeds. When his enemy takes up the shield, rendering himself virtually impervious to Porras’ blows, then it becomes the most desirable of objects, and every mark Porras leaves on the shield with his sword edge becomes a testament to his skill. Porras kills his enemy, mortally wounded in doing so, but the point of the story is that his lover has him brought home on the shield he had now deservedly won. Adventuring Most mist elves, male and female alike, will undertake a decade or two of what humans like to refer to as ‘adventuring’ on reaching maturity. This rite of passage sees them journey to the furthest corners of the world in search of the greatest challenges. They co-operate well with others, and their loyalty and skill makes them valued companions. They forge bonds in these years that are often lifelong, and will bring non-pure offspring into the world, and form close, though informal attachments. The point, of course, is to make a start on the gathering of a personal legend. Mist elves are high-risk companions, who always seek out the greatest challenges, the greatest dangers.
