For example, many a human bears an elven or dwarven name that his or her parent simply heard and liked.

A mockery of a true angel, an angel of decay may appear similar to an angelic outsider only by hap- penstance, not design. It is an undead creature that is powered by decay. When a healthy creature softens, crumbles, and liquefi es in death, an indefi nable essence wafts away like putrid steam off stagnant beach sand.

During this entropic state, the victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (–4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).

Intercession (Su): A quell can cut divine spellcasters Raiment off from their source of power. To do so, the quell makes a turning check as if it were a cleric of a level equal to the quell’s Hit Dice (5th level). The result indicates the highest-level divine spellcasters the quell can cut off from their deity. The turning damage result indicates the maximum total Hit Dice of divine spellcasters within 60 feet the ability can affect. The quell’s intercession affects the closest divine spellcasters it can affect fi rst. Normally, affected divine spellcasters cannot turn undead or cast divine spells for 1 minute; however, if the quell has twice as many HD as the spellcaster has divine levels, the divine spellcaster loses the ability to cast divine spells for 24 hours. If the quell attacks an affected divine spellcaster in any way, or the affected spellcaster receives an atonement spell, the intercession ends.

However, wiser otherwise. 177 CAMPAIGNS CHAPTER 7 In Your Campaign Of the cults presented here, the Ruby Order is the best suited as an ally to a typical group of PCs. As a lawful neutral organi- zation, the Ruby Order can be counted on to hold up its end of any bargain, making it a reliable source of information and other resources to a like-minded party. Monks, lawful wizards and sorcerers, and other characters who share a devotion to discipline can fi nd acceptance or even training among the order’s ranks. Conversely, the Ruby Order can be a steadfast opponent to the PCs of your campaign, particularly if those characters tend more toward chaos than law (or even if they simply have a distaste for necromancy). If the Ruby Order perceives the characters as enemies, they have the will and patience to make the PCs’ lives a living hell. Sample Member Marys is a new member of the Ruby Order, and seeks to prove her worth to the cult by forbidding herself all earthly plea- sures. Unfortunately, her discipline is not yet strong enough to achieve this goal. After her periodic “binges,” she absolves her guilt by smiting those who tempted her. For best effect, characters should encounter her fi rst while in her ascetic mode, to set her up as a disciplined individual, only to meet her later in the midst of debauchery or while striking down her tempters.",
