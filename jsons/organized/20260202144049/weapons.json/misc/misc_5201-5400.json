Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and requires geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and shatter. FLESH COLOSSUS The epitome of the necromancer’s art, a flesh colossus spreads terror and destruction in its wake. A horrific humanoid mass of rotting flesh, a flesh colossus resembles nothing so much as a Colossal zombie, but in fact it is a construct of great power. Its com- posite construction is revealed only by the coarse texture of its grayish skin. A flesh colossus knows all lan- guages spoken in life by the ghost who acts as its control- ling spirit. When the control- ling spirit is suppressed, it mut- ters in all the tongues spoken by its component corpses. Combat Unwieldy because of its enor- mous bulk, a flesh colossus relies upon simple methods that require no finesse—such as tearing up a tree by the roots and using it as an enormous club, lifting wagons or cot- tages (or any object weighing less than 10 tons) and tossing 172 :5 RETPAHC SRETSNOM than three hundred previously animated Medium-size humanoid creatures must be stripped of their flesh and the bones, which are then rendered in two great vats. The resulting semiliquid bone-paste is then cast into a new articulated skeleton of great size, to which the rendered flesh is applied like wet clay to shape the figure. Finally, the necromancer must bind a ghost of at least 10 HD (the more powerful the better) into the colossus to act as its controlling spirit. Without the controlling spirit, the colossus is just an oversized zombie; with it, it functions as a golem of great size and repugnant appearance. If no ghost is available, the necromancer may occupy the colossus himself by casting magic jar. The colossus costs 760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body takes no great skill, and many flesh colossi reveal that fact in their uncouth forms. The creator must be 29th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and requires magic jar, limited wish, polymorph any object, and finger of death. IRON COLOSSUS An iron colossus is at least 80 feet tall and weighs around 350,000 pounds. It can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone colossus, although it almost always dis- plays armor of some If successful, the stomp deals double damage (8d6 +24 and pins the victim until the colossus chooses to release him.

Those who suc- ceed on their saves take a –4 circumstance penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for the next 2d6+4 minutes. Magic Immunity (Ex): A flesh colossus is immune to all magical and supernatural effects except those that use negative energy (see below). Negative Energy Affinity (Su): A flesh colossus retains some residue of the negative energy that once animated the component corpses from which it was created. Any negative energy spell targeted at the colossus repairs damage taken by the colossus at the rate of 1d10 hit points per level of the spell.
