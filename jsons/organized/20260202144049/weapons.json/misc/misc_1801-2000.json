Sneak Attack (Ex):  Alyson deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Alyson can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Trapﬁnding (Ex): Alyson can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

ORDER OF ILLUMINATION Evil might lie behind any door, and shadow might hide in any heart. The Order of Illumination holds this maxim close as it seeks out and destroys evil wherever necessary. The organization has two main branches, each dedicated to fulﬁlling one of the order’s two functions. The ﬁrst is to ferret out evil wherever it hides, and it is the shadowbane stalkers who devote themselves to ﬁnding hidden evils and piercing the lies of evildoers. The second task is to confront these evils directly, and it is the shadowbane inquisitors who pick up sword and shield and take the ﬁght to evil creatures. Although many of its members adven - ture with their comrades (especially in partnerships between a stalker and an inquisitor) and with independent adventuring groups, the Order of Illumination is not an adventuring- oriented organization. The order is far more concerned with ﬁnding and combating the evils that hide within civilized communities than it is with ﬁnding lost tombs or raiding the lairs of dragons. The comrades are quick to praise such activity when it clearly serves the cause of good, but members are encouraged to look for evil closer to home whenever possible.",

A prospective member must prove his or her dedication, purity, and desire to ﬁght evil by fasting for three days. During this trial period, paladins and clerics belonging to the order visit the candidate to pose difﬁcult moral questions, engage in mock combat trials, and repeatedly subject the candidate to detect evil, detect chaos, and discern lies spells. Membership also requires an offering of 100 gp. A potential member need not meet any speciﬁc class or level requirements, but he cannot be evil or chaotic.

Player characters who are members can count on shadowbane stalkers to provide a steady stream of rumors about evil or suspicious activity, and can ﬁnd a safe place to rest and heal in any city that has a cathedral dedicated to the order. The order’s intolerance of evil means that it is willing to combat any real threat, but it won’t throw lives away needlessly just on the player characters’ say-so. If the PCs need help with a particularly evil foe or opposing force, they might be able to appeal to an individual inquisitor, but the DM has the ﬁnal say in any such activities. The Order of Illumination greatly covets holy weapons, and it will pay 60% of a weapon’s value if it has the holy special ability. Likewise, the order prizes the destruction of evil items and weapons and will pay 60% of the value of any such item turned in by a member. The order sees the procurement of holy items and the destruction of unholy items as among its most important duties.",

The guild has no particular loyalty to monarch or community, but the organization’s leaders are smart enough to realize that a group as small as theirs would not likely survive an attack coordinated by a powerful ruler. The guild is willing to risk the enmity of individual nobles or wealthy merchants, but not the ire of an entire kingdom or city. Because of the guild’s shadowy reputation and the fearsome combination of skills its members possess, few are willing to cross the shadowminds, and few can afford their rates. Thus, they often work on their own initiative to gather information, undertake special missions of their own design, and even adventure outside their home territory to hone their skills in different environments and open combat.",

They use their superior speed to set up flankattacks and maneuver around the enemy’s the front lineso that they can attack the more vulnerable opponents,such as spellcasters. If a foe proves too tough to defeatwith melee attacks, the centaurs use the withdrawaction to scatter in all directions. When they’re safelyaway, they use their bows to discourage pursuit. GROUND FLOOR Most visitors to the college don’t get past the groundfloor. The upper level is reserved for the Fochlucanmasters’ business. The following sections offer short descriptions of the college’s major ground-level areas, both indoors andout. The area names correspond to the map shown onpage 50 of The Complete Adventurer, which is repro- duced here for convenience. For ease of reference, thearea descriptions are presented in alphabetical order. Banquet Hall The double doors leading into this room have shinybrass fittings. Carvings on the polished woodensurfaces depict lute players strumming their instru-ments. Read or paraphrase the following when thePCs enter. The windows in this chamber provide ample light when the sun shines. At night, two brass candelabras,each bearing a permanent daylight spell, provide illumi- nation. The candelabras are kept in the lower part of thesideboard, along with an assortment of flatware andserving dishes made of porcelain, wood, and pewter. The Fochlucan masters use this room to entertain important guests and to hold conferences. Members ofthe Yew Circle (see page 49 in the Complete Adventurer ) meet here several times a year to discuss college busi-ness and to decide the course of the college’s activities inthe political and diplomatic arenas.",

        "description":  "2 + Int modi- ﬁ er. Class Features All the following are class features of the warlock. Weapon and Armor Proﬁ  ciency:  Warlocks are pro ﬁ cient with all simple weapons. They are pro ﬁ cient with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for warlock invocations are relatively simple, a warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like arcane spellcasters, a warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations, including eldritch blast,  have a somatic compo- nent). A multiclass warlock still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from levels in other classes. Invocations:  A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invoca- tions that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following quali ﬁ cations: A warlock ’s invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks o f  o p p o rt u n i ty .  A n  i n v o c a t i o n  c a n  b e  d i s r u p t e d ,  j u s t  a s  a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock ’s invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation ’s description speci ﬁ cally states otherwise. A warlock ’s caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level. The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock ’s Charisma modi ﬁ er. Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock cannot bene ﬁ t from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however, bene ﬁ t from the Ability Focus feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual ), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability and Empower Spell-Like Ability (see pages 303 and 304 of the Monster Manual). The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns new invocations, as summarized on Table 1 –1 and described below. A list of available invocations can be found following this class description, and a complete description of each invocation can be found in Chapter 4 of this book. At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation, he can also replace an invocation he already knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At 11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, greater, or dark). Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Pro ﬁ ciency above. Warlocks can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters; see Warlocks and Prestige Classes, page 18, for details. Eldritch Blast (Sp):  The ﬁ rst ability a warlock learns is eldritch blast.  A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast  is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw. An eldritch blast  deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An eldritch blast  is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal to one-half the warlock ’s class level (round down), with a minimum spell level of 1st and a maximum of 9th when a warlock reaches 18th level or higher. An eldritch blast  is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to eldritch blast.  An eldritch blast  deals half damage to objects. Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock ’s eldritch blast  (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus (eldritch blast ) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any) associated with a warlock ’s eldritch blast  by 2. See page 303 of the Monster Manual. 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   7 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   7 9/15/04   9:20:48 AM 9/15/04   9:20:48 AM8CHAPTER 1 CLASSES Detect Magic (Sp):  Beginning at 2nd level, a warlock can use detect magic  as the spell at will. His caster level equals his class level. Damage Reduction (Su):  Forti ﬁ ed by the supernatural power ﬂ owing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron. At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock ’s damage reduction improves as shown on Table 1 –1. Deceive Item (Ex):  At 4th level and higher, a warlock has the ability to more easily commandeer magic items made for the use of other characters. When making a Use Magic D e vi c e  c h e c k ,  a  w ar l o c k  can  tak e  1 0  e v e n  if  dis tr a c t e d  o r  threatened. Fiendish Resilience (Su):  Beginning at 8th level, a warlock knows the trick of ﬁ endish resilience. Once per day, as a free action, he can enter a state that lasts for 2 minutes. While in this state, the warlock gains fast healing 1. At 13th level, a warlock ’s ﬁ endish resilience improves. When in his ﬁ endish resilience state, he gains fast healing 2 instead. At 18th level, a warlock ’s ﬁ endish resilience improves to fast healing 5. Energy Resistance (Su):  At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, ﬁ re, and sonic. Once the types are chosen, this energy resistance cannot be changed. At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 against the two selected types of energy. Imbue Item (Su):  A warlock of 12th level or higher can use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he does not know the spells required to make an item (although h e m ust kno w th e appropriate item creation f eat ). H e can substitute a Use Magic Device check (DC 15 + spell level for arcane spells or 25 + spell level for divine spells) in place of a required spell he doesn ’t know or can ’t cast. If the check succeeds, the warlock can create the item as if he had cast the required spell. If it fails, he cannot complete the item. He does not expend the XP or gp costs for making the item; his progress is simply arrested. He cannot retry this Use Magic Device check for that spell until he gains a new level. WARLOCK INVOCATIONS Warlocks choose the invocations they learn as they gain levels, much like bards or sorcerers choose which spells to learn. However, a warlock ’s arcane repertoire is even more limited than that of a sorcerer, and his invocations are spell-like abilities, not spells. In addition to its grade (least, lesser, greater, or dark), every invocation has a spell level equivalent, which is used in the calculation of save DCs and for other purposes. A least invocation has a level equivalent of 1st or 2nd; a lesser, 3rd or 4th; a greater, 5th or 6th; and a dark invocation has a level equivalent of 6th or higher (maximum 9th). The level equivalent for each invocation is given in its description in Chapter 4. A warlock can dismiss any invocation as a standard action, just as a wizard can dismiss a spell. Invocations and Eldritch Blast:  Eldritch blast  is not an invocation, but some invocations provide a warlock with the ability to modify his eldritch blast  or add new eldritch attacks. ELDRITCH ESSENCE INVOCATIONS Some of a warlock ’s invocations, such as frightful blast, modify the damage or other effects of the warlock ’s eldritch blast.  These are called eldritch essence invocations. Unless noted otherwise, eldritch blasts  modi ﬁ ed by eldritch essence invocations deal damage normally in addition to imparting the effects described in the invocation description. A warlock can apply only one eldritch essence invocation to a single eldritch blast,  choosing from any of the eldritch essence invocations that he knows. When a warlock applies an eldritch essence invocation to his eldritch blast,  the spell level equivalent of the modi ﬁ ed blast is equal to the spell- level of the eldritch blast  or of the eldritch essence invocation, whichever is higher.

A warlock can apply an eldritch essence invocation and a blast shape invocation (see below) to the same blast. When a warlock uses both kinds of invocations to alter an eldritch blast,  the spell level equivalent is equal to the spell level of the eldritch blast,  the level of the eldritch essence invoca- tion, or the level of the blast shape invocation, whichever is higher. Example:  Morthos, a 1st-level warlock, decides to make his eldritch blast  attack into a frightful blast.  Morthos ’s eldritch blast  is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell, while frightful blast is an effect equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. His frightful blast is thus the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

Th e D M determines th e actual nature of th e skin, be it demonic, devilish, or from some other ﬁ endish creature. Poison (Sp):  An acolyte of the skin can use poison  once per day as an 8th-level caster. The save DC is 14 + the acolyte ’s pri- mary spellcasting ability modi ﬁ er (Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and warlocks, Wisdom for clerics, and so forth). At 5th level, an acolyte can use this ability two times per day. Flame Resistant (Ex):  At 2nd level and higher, the ﬁ end- ish skin binds more tightly, granting an acolyte resistance to ﬁ re 10. Fiendish Glare (Su):  From 3rd level on, an acolyte of the skin has the supernatural ability to unnerve opponents with a ferocious glare once per day. This is not a gaze attack, and the target need not meet the acolyte ’s eyes or even see the acolyte (although the acolyte must have line of effect to the target). Glaring is a standard action that affects any creature the acolyte can see within 100 feet. The target becomes shaken for 10 minutes, and must also attempt a Will save (DC 10 + acolyte ’s class level + Cha modi ﬁ er) or be stunned. The duration of the stun effect depends on the target ’s hit points: 50 or less 10 rounds 51 to 100   3 rounds 101 to 150   2 rounds 151 or more   1 round Fiendish glare is a mind-affecting fear effect. Skin Adaptation (Su):  By 5th level, an acolyte ’s skin and its wearer have grown more comfortable together, as if they had never been separate. The increase to natural armor granted by the ﬁ endish skin improves to +2, the acolyte gains a +2 inherent bonus to Constitution, and the acolyte ’s darkvision is effective out to 120 feet. Cold Resistant (Ex):  Beginning at 6th level, an acolyte has resistance to cold 10. Glare of the Pit (Su):  At 7th level and higher, an acolyte has the supernatural ability to produce ﬁ ery rays from his eyes. Once per day as a standard action, he can project two rays (one from each eye) with a range of 100 feet. Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 8d6 points of ﬁ re damage. The rays can be aimed at two different targets within range, but the target of each ray must be designated simultaneously. Summon Fiend (Sp):  A t  9 t h  l e v e l ,  a n acolyte learns to draw on another power of his ﬁ endish skin. If the skin is demonic, once per day he can summon a babau; if devilish, once per day he can summon a chain devil. The summoned creature does the acolyte ’s bidding, but it automatically returns whence it came after 1 hour. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it might have. An acolyte ’s caster level for this ability is equal to his spellcaster level. Fiendish Symbiosis (Ex):  At 10th level, the ﬁ endish skin and acolyte become one, and only ﬁ nal death can separate them. The acolyte ’s type changes to outsider. Additionally, an acolyte of this level gains damage reduction 10/good. Unlike other outsiders, an acolyte can be raised or resurrected. SAMPLE ACOLYTE OF THE SKIN",

She does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard).

She also adds a +1 bonus to each die of damage dealt by spells she casts with the force descriptor. If the force spell doesn ’t deal damage expressed by dice, she adds only a +1 bonus to the total damage dealt. For example, a magic missile  cast by a 9th-level wizard/1st- level argent savant deals 1d4+2 points of damage per missile. A 9th-level wizard/4th-level argent savant deals 4d6+7 points of force damage with her Mordenkainen ’s sword  spell. Force Armor (Ex):  At 2nd level and higher, an argent savant gains more ben- eﬁ t from defensive force spells than other characters. If she casts a force spell that pro- vides an armor bonus or a shield bonus to Armor Class, she increas- es the spell ’s normal armor bonus by 2. For example, mage armor  nor- mally adds an armor bonus of +4 to the caster ’s AC, but an argent savant with this ability who casts mage ar- mor adds an armor bonus of +6 to her AC. Enduring Force (Ex):  Force s p e l l s  c a s t  b y  a n  a r g e n t  s a v a n t  o f 3rd level or higher linger longer than normal, and they are more dif ﬁ cult to counter or dispel. The duration of a force spell cast by the savant is doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to it. However, the spell ’s level and casting time are unchanged. The same restrictions that apply to extended spells apply to spells affected by en- during force. In addition, the DC required to counter or dispel the argent savant ’s force spells increases by 4. Ablate Force (Ex):  Due to her improved understanding of magical force, an argent savant of 4th level or higher can prevent force damage to herself. She subtracts her class level from damage dealt by any force spell or effect. A force spell producing multiple attacks, such as magic missile,  is considered a single attack for this purpose; deduct the savant ’s level from the total damage dealt by the spell, not the damage dealt by each individual missile. Unbind Force (Su):  At 5th level, an argent savant learns how to unweave a force spell or effect and liberate its magi-cal energy. As a standard action, she can attempt to dispel a single force spell or effect within 60 feet (even those normally immune to dispel magic,  such as wall of force ). If she succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + opposing caster ’s level), the force effect is unbound.

Some are cut down before they have a chance at true glory; others ﬁ nd true peace only in the afterlife; and others are brought back from death by companions with the powerful magical resources to per-form such a miracle. For a rare few such  arcanists, this trip to the great beyond and back brings a new enlightenment — a comprehension of the body and its individual parts that transcends the understanding of those who have not expe- rienced death and returned to tell the tale. These newly raised spellcasters say that the ﬁ rst sound they hear upon returning to life is the pulse of life-giving blood in their veins. To these fortunate few, this ﬂ ow of blood through their veins is sweet music: the sound of life. They can feel it reenergizing every particle of their form, ﬂ ushing death away and leaving life in its place. It is thick and warm, and they greedily embrace it. Such arcane spellcasters become blood magi: formerly deceased spellcasters who, when returned to life, gain an understanding of their blood ’s importance, bequeathed by their close call. They learn to evoke magic from this vital ﬂ uid that sustains their lives. Blood magi cannot be trained, owing to the unusual nature of their enlightenment, and they are most likely to have ﬁ rst been sorcerers. NPC blood magi are thus rarely, if ever, found in groups.

        "description":  "The character must have been killed, then returned to life. Class Skills The blood magus ’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).  Skill Points at Each Level:  2 + Int modi ﬁ er. Class Features All the following are class features of the blood magus prestige class. Weapon and Armor Pro ﬁ ciency:  Blood magi gain no proﬁ ciency with any weapon or armor. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  At each level except 5th and 10th, a blood magus gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a blood magus, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Blood Component (Su):  A blood magus can substitute a drop of his own blood for a spell ’s material components, if any, and in so doing increase the spell ’s power. The pinprick or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   26 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   26 9/15/04   2:50:16 PM 9/15/04   2:50:16 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 27(just like using material components) that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus but raises the spell ’s caster level by 1. Damage reduction, if the character has any, doesn ’t apply to this damage. If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1 gp), the component must still be provided. If a spell has no material component, a blood magus can still use this ability to enhance a spell if he desires. Durable Casting (Ex):  A blood magus has a knack for being able to concentrate on casting spells and maintaining them despite taking damage while doing so. For the purpose of making a Concentration check to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when he might be distracted by damage, a blood magus subtracts his level from any hit point damage dealt to him by an attack that strikes him during the action (or whenever he is subject to a source of continuous damage, such as Melf ’s acid arrow ). A blood magus still takes all the damage dealt to him, but the damage is less likely to affect his ability to cast, concentrate on, or direct spells successfully. For example, a 1st-level blood magus can “ignore ” 1 point of damage from each source that damages him while casting a spell for the purpose of determining the DC of his Con- centration check to cast successfully. If struck for 5 points of damage while casting a spell, he must make a Concentration check to successfully cast, but the DC is only 10 + 4 (damage dealt minus 1) + the spell ’s level. A 5th-level blood magus could ignore up to 5 points of damage dealt from each source that damages him during casting (and thus wouldn ’t have to make a Concentration check if struck for 5 points of damage or less). Because of this ability, damage a blood magus takes from using his blood component and bloodseeking spell special abilities never requires him to make a Concentration check to ﬁ nish the spell he is casting. Stanch (Ex):  A blood magus automatically becomes stable when his hit points drop below 0. He still dies if he reaches –10 hit points or lower. Scari ﬁ cation (Ex):  Beginning at 2nd level, a blood magus can inscribe spells on his own skin for later use. This process involves deeply scratching the skin (which deals no damage but often leaves scars). The scratches remain fresh until the inscribed spell is cast, at which time the wound heals normally. Effectively, a blood magus gains the Scribe Scroll feat (see page 99 of the Player ’s Handbook ) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Scribe Scroll also apply to this ability . Likewise, “reading ” a scar follows the same rules as reading a scroll, but only a blood magus can decipher his own scars. One ’s own skin leaves a limited amount of room to easily inscribe and “read ” magical scars. Thus, a blood magus can have only six of these scars at any one time. Death Knell (Sp):  At 3rd level and higher, a blood magus has the ability to use death knell  as the spell once per day. Blood Draught (Ex):  At 4th level, a blood magus learns how to store spells of up to 3rd level in his own blood. Effectively, he gains the Brew Potion feat (see page 89 of the Player ’s Handbook ) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Brew Potion also apply to this ability, with the following exceptions. Once “brewed, ” a blood draught remains in circulation within a magus ’s body. The maximum number of draughts he can store at one time is equal to his blood magus level + his Con score, but if he is ever slain, they are all immediately ruined —even if he is subsequently returned to life. Blood draughts are never accidentally lost through major blood loss or by a blood-draining attack. To consume a draught, a blood magus pricks his skin, automatically bringing forth the desired effect. This is a stan dar d a cti o n th a t p ro v o k es a tta cks o f o p po rtuni ty , lik e drinking a potion. Another individual can partake of a blood draught (if he or she has a strong stomach) by drinking 1 ounce of the blood magus ’s blood as a full-round action. The blood magus must have an open wound to share the effects of a blood draught with another creature; if he lacks one, the creature can in ﬂ ict a wound that deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus as part of the action to consume the draught. A blood magus cannot store his blood in a container to share at a later time. The blood draught must be drawn fresh from his body, or it loses potency within 1 round. Homunculus (Su):  From 5th level on, a blood magus can use his blood to give life to a new companion creature —a homunculus (see page 154 of the Monster Manual ). A blood Table 2 –5: The Blood Magus Base Attack Fort Ref WillLevel Bonus Save Save Save Special Spells per Day/Spells Known1st +0 +2 +0 +0 Blood component, +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class     durable casting, stanch2nd +1 +3 +0 +0 Scarification +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class3rd +1 +3 +1 +1 Death knell  +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class 4th +2 +4 +1 +1 Blood draught +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class5th +2 +4 +1 +1 Homunculus — 6th +3 +5 +2 +2 Bloodseeking spell +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class7th +3 +5 +2 +2 Thicker than water +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class8th +4 +6 +2 +2 Awaken blood +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class9th +4 +6 +3 +3 Infusion +1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class10th +5 +7 +3 +3 Bloodwalk — 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   27 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   27 9/15/04   2:50:18 PM 9/15/04   2:50:18 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 28magus need not meet any of the given prerequisites to create the homunculus; however, a blood magus must permanently sacri ﬁ ce 1 hit point as part of the creation process. The process requires 1 hour. A blood magus enjoys a stronger than normal link with his homunculus. By touching the homunculus, a blood magus can transfer his wounds to the creature (up to 1 hp per level w i t h  e a c h  t o u c h ) .  T h i s  i s  a  s t a n d a r d  a c t i o n  t h a t  p r o v o k e s  attacks of opportunity. Each time a blood magus gains a class level, his homunculus advances 1 Hit Die, as described on page 290 of the Monster Manual,  and it gains all the normal bene ﬁ ts of its increased Hit Dice (increased base attack bonus, saves, and so on). The homunculus advances to a maximum of 6 Hit Dice when the blood magus reaches 9th level. If his homunculus is destroyed, a blood magus takes 2d10 points of damage, as noted in the Monster Manual.  A blood magus ’s death results in the death of his homunculus. A blood magus can have only one homunculus at any given time. Bloodseeking Spell (Su):  Beginning at 6th level, a blood magus can imbue his spells with the ability to draw blood from their targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must inﬂ ict a wound on himself; this is a free action that deals 3 points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if a blood magus has any, doesn ’t apply to this damage. A bloodseeking spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each target that takes damage from the spell. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect. Thicker Than Water (Su):  At 7th level and higher, a blood magus ’s vital ﬂ uids are partially under his control. When a blood magus is injured, his blood withdraws from the wound, avoiding some damage that he would otherwise take. This ability gives the blood magus damage reduction 1/bludgeoning. Awaken Blood (Su):  At 8th level and higher, a blood magus can bestow momentary consciousness on an opponent ’s blood. If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack, the opponent ’s blood tries to get free of its con ﬁ nement —all at once. The pressure disrupts the victim ’s tissues, dealing 10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable only once per day, but a blood magus can try to use it again later in the day if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect. Infusion (Ex):  Upon reaching 9th level, a blood magus prepares a special one-time distillation of his own blood. After partaking of the infusion, he gains a 2-point increase to his Constitution score. Bloodwalk (Su):  At 10th level, a blood magus becomes perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the super-natural ability to transport himself great distances via the blood of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seam-lessly enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze, plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar ﬂ uid) whose size equals or exceeds his own and pass any distance to another living creature on the same plane in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. A blood magus merely designates a direction and distance (“a living creature twenty miles due west of here ”), and the bloodwalk ability transports him to a destination creature as close as possible to the desired location. He can ’t specify a named individual as the endpoint unless he has previ- ously obtained a sample of that creature ’s blood and has it preserved in a vial that he carries. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the blood magus. A blood magus cannot use himself as an entry creature. If an intended entry creature is unwill-ing, he must make a successful melee touch attack to enter. (A missed touch attack does not use up the ability for that day.) When exiting a creature, a blood magus chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and exiting a creature is painless unless a blood magus wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature ﬁ nds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and quite  unsettling.Illus. by G. Kubic A blood magus uses his bloodwalk ability to enter a bugbear . . . 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   28 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   28 9/15/04   2:50:19 PM 9/15/04   2:50:19 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 29 If he desires, a blood magus can attempt to make a bloody exit from the destination creature. He bursts forth explosively from the creature ’s body, dealing 10d6 points of damage unless the creature makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood magus ’s class level + blood magus ’s Con modi ﬁ er). When he makes a bloody exit, a blood magus must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round from the shock of his expulsion. SAMPLE BLOOD MAGUS",

This requires a DC 15 Craft (wood-working, leatherworking, or metalworking) check. The gp and XP required to create the ef ﬁ gy depends on its size, as described on page 155. Improved Ef ﬁ gy (Ex):  An ef ﬁ gy master of 3rd level or higher can improve upon his creations, granting them a permanent +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and saves. This requires one day of work and costs 100 gp of supplies per Hit Die of the ef ﬁ gy to be improved, but has no XP cost. Efﬁ gy Link (Su):  At 5th level and higher, an ef ﬁ gy master can create a supernatural bond between himself and one of his ef ﬁ gies. This requires a 1-hour ritual.

Furthermore, an ef ﬁ gy master gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws and caster level checks as long as he is within 5 feet of his bonded ef ﬁ gy. An ef ﬁ gy master can be linked to only one ef ﬁ gy at any time. If the linked ef ﬁ gy is destroyed, or if the ef ﬁ gy master wants to establish a new link, he can create a link to another efﬁ gy (and eliminate the old link) by performing the ritual with the new ef ﬁ gy.SAMPLE EFFIGY MASTER",

Elemental Specialty (Ex):  The ﬁ rst step toward tran- scending mortal form requires an elemental savant to choose her elemental specialty. Upon  entering the class, she must select an element and its associated energy type (air = electric- ity, earth = acid, ﬁ re = ﬁ re, or water = cold). This choice must match the Energy Sub- stitution feat that the savant selected to gain entry to the prestige class. When the savant casts a spell that nor-mally deals energy damage, its energy descriptor changes to the savant ’s chosen energy type, and it deals damage of that energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example, an elemental savant choosing to specialize in ﬁ re could still cast meld into stone,  and its descriptor would not change because it does not deal energy damage. However, if she casts Melf ’s acid arrow, the spell would deal ﬁ re damage and have the ﬁ re descriptor instead of dealing acid damage and having the acid descriptor. Resistance to Energy (Ex):  As an elemental savant gains levels in this prestige class, she becomes more resistant to the type of energy allied with her chosen element. At 1st level, she gains resistance 5 against this energy type. This resistance rises to 10 at 4th level and 20 at 7th level. Immunity to Sleep (Ex):  At 2nd level, as an elemental savant continues to transcend her mortal form, she gains immunity to sleep effects. Energy Penetration (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, an elemental savant further re ﬁ nes her ability to wield energy associated with her chosen element. When she casts a spell using that type of energy, she gains a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) to overcome a creature ’s spell resis- tance. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4. These bonuses stack with those granted by the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats. Energy Focus (Ex):  From 5th level on, an elemental s a v a n t  i s  b e t t e r  a b l e  t o manipulate energy asso- ciated with her chosen element. The save DC for any spell with that energy descrip- tor increases by 1. At 10th level, these save DCs increase by 1 again (total increase of 2). These increases are cumulative with those granted by the Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus feats. Darkvision (Ex): At 6th level, an elemental savant gains dark- vision out to 60 feet.

        "description":  "An enlightened ﬁ st adds her class level to her monk level to determine her class-based AC bonus, her unarmed damage, her unarmored speed bonus, and the number of daily attempts of her Stunning Fist feat. If she has no monk levels, she gains the AC bonus, unarmed damage, and unarmored speed bonus of a monk whose level equals her enlightened ﬁ st level, but she can ’t add her Wisdom bonus to her AC. An enlightened ﬁ st does not count her class levels for the purpose of determining when she gains any other monk class features, such as reduced penalties for ﬂ urry of blows attack rolls, bonus feats, evasion, or other special abilities. Fist of Energy (Su):  Once per round as a free action, an enlightened fist of 2nd level or higher can spend one of her daily stunning attempts to imbue her unarmed strikes with either electricity or fire. The enlightened fist chooses the energy type each time she activates. For 1 round, each of her unarmed strike that hits deals an extra 1d6 points of damage (electricity or fire, depending on the choice). At 6th level and higher, an enlightened fist can cause her energy-imbued unarmed strikes to burst with flame o r ligh tnin g o n a cri ti cal hi t. In ad di ti o n t o dealin g an extra 1d6 points of energy damage, her unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d10 points of energy damage on a success-ful critical hit. If the enlightened fist ’s unarmed critical multiplier is ×3, she adds an extra 2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, she adds an extra 3d10 points of energy damage. An enlightened fist with monk levels can use this ability to channel energy through wielded monk weapons just as she can through her unarmed attacks. Arcane Fist (Su):  Beginning at 3rd level, an enlightened ﬁ st can spend one of her daily stunning attempts to cast and deliver a touch spell as part of an unarmed full attack action. She can choose to deliver the touch spell with any single unarmed strike attack she makes during the action. Arcane Rejuvenation (Su):  An enlightened fist of 5th level or higher can channel arcane energy to heal her own wounds. As a standard action, she can sacrifice one of her prepared spells or un used spell slots; doing this heals a number of hit points of damage equal to the spell ’s level. Hold Ray (Ex):  At 7th level or higher, an enlightened ﬁ st can cast any spell that produces a ray effect as a touch spell instead. The spell ’s range is reduced to touch, and its Effect entry is replaced with “Target: Creature touched. ” She can deliver the spell with a touch attack or with a normal attack, and she can hold the charge as with a normal touch spell. An enlightened ﬁ st can combine this ability with arcane ﬁ st (see above) to deliver a ray-effect spell as part of an unarmed full attack action. Diamond Soul (Ex):  At 9th level, an enlightened ﬁ st gains spell resistance equal to 10 + the total of her monk levels and enlightened ﬁ st levels .",

He does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spell-casting class before becoming a geometer, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Glyph of Warding:  A geometer adds glyph of warding  to his spell- book as a 3rd-level arcane spell. He can prepare and cast the spell just like any other spell he knows. Spellglyph (Su):  A spell- glyph is an arcane diagram that substitutes for a speci ﬁ c spell ’s verbal and material components (if any). When a geometer casts a prepared spell in conjunction with a spellglyph scribed for that spell, he can cast the spell as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat. The spell-glyph replaces any material components (other than a focus) normally required by the spell. A geometer chooses at the time of casting whether to use a spellglyph. An expended spellglyph disappears, just like any other material component. Spellglyphs are normally scribed on parchment, much like scrolls. Preparing a spellglyph requires 1 hour and the use of rare inks costing 25 gp per spell level. If the spell normally requires an expensive material component (with a value of m o r e  t h a n  1  gp ) ,  e x o t i c  i n k s  a n d  t r e a t -ments of equal cost must be used in the preparation of the spellglyph. Book of Geometry (Ex):  At 2nd level and higher, a geometer uses a unique system for recording the details of a spell that drasti- cally reduces the expense of maintaining spellbooks. Every spell he learns from now on requires only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to scribe a spell into a spellbook and materials costing 100 gp per page. A geometer ’s spellbook is dif ﬁ cult for nongeometers to decipher and use. The Spellcraft DC to decipher or prepare spells from a geometer ’s spellbook is increased by 5 for nongeometers (see page 178 of the Player ’s Handbook ). Sigilsight (Ex):  A geometer of 3rd level or higher can use a Search check to find magic traps based on runes, glyphs, sigils, symbols, and other writings as a rogue can. He gains a bonus equal to his caster level on all Search checks to find traps of this sort. A geometer who merely comes within 10 feet of a magic rune, glyph, sigil, or symbol, or the threshold of danger for such a device, is entitled to make a Search check as if he were actively searching for a magic trap. Pass Sigil (Su):  Beginning at 3rd level, a geometer can temporarily negate magical wards based on written symbols, sigils, runes, or glyphs. As a standard action, a geometer can attempt to pass such a sigil. He must succeed on a level check (DC 6 + the sigil creator ’s caster level). If successful, he can suppress the effects of the device for as long as he maintains concentration (which might make it possible for others to pass the sigil safely, too). A geometer must be able to see the device to be passed. Powerful Spellglyph (Ex):  When a 5th-level geometer prepares a spellglyph for a spell, he knows how to strengthen the spell beyond its normal effects. His caster level is treated as 1 higher for any spell he casts with the use of a spellglyph.",

        "description":  "Must acquire a piece of starmetal weighing at least 2 ounces, powder it, and consume it by drinking it in a specially prepared infusion. This infusion requires arcane reagents costing 1,000 gp and takes one week to prepare. Class Skills The Green Star adept ’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowl- e d g e  ( a r c a n a )  ( I n t ) ,  K n o w l e d g e (architecture and engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowl- edge (history) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).  Skill Points at Each Level:  2 + Int modi ﬁ er. Class Features All the following are class features of the Green Star adept prestige class. Weapon and Armor Proﬁ  ciency: Green Star adepts gain pro ﬁ ciency wi t h  s im p l e  w e a p o n s .  T h e y  g a in  n o  proﬁ ciency with armor or shields. Spells per Day /Spells Known: At every even-numbered level, a Green Star adept gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star adept, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Damage Reduction (Ex):  The starmetal infusion rein- forces the ﬂ esh of a Green Star adept, making him resistant to physical blows. He gains damage reduction 1/adamantine. Each level thereafter, his damage reduction improves by 1, until by 10th level, he has damage reduction 10/adamantine. Improved Caster Level (Ex):  A Green Star adept adds his class level to his caster level in another arcane spellcasting class to determine his effective spellcaster level. If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star adept, the player must decide to which class to add each adept level for this purpose. For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level Green Star adept ’s caster level would be 9th, due to this ability , but he would o n l y  h a v e  a c c e s s  t o  4 t h - l e v e l  s p e l l s (5th-level wizard plus two arcane spellcasting class levels from being a 4th-level Green Star adept). Starmetal Dependency (Ex): A Green Star adept must consume more starmetal to continue his trans- formation. When he gains a level in this class beyond 1st, he does not gain any of the class features for that level until he performs a special ritual that requires 24 hours, 1 pound of starmetal, and other arcane reagents and materials costing 1,000 gp. A Green Star adept ’s base attack bonus, saving throws, skills, and feats or ability score increases are not dependent on this ritual —he fails to gain the special class abilities only until he completes the ritual.

His ﬂ esh takes on a faint emerald hue, and it becomes denser and stronger as the starmetal infusion takes hold. A 1st-level adept ’s Strength score increases by 1, but his Dexterity score drops by 1 (to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus also improves by 1. When an adept reaches 4th level, his Strength and his natural armor bonus improve by an additional 1 point. At 7th level, an adept ’s Strength increases by 2 more, for a total increase of +4, while his Dexterity is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus improves by another 2 points, for a total bonus of +4. A t  1 0 t h  l e v e l ,  a n  a d e p t ’s Strength score increases by 2 more points (total increase of +6) and his Dexterity is reduced by 1 (total reduction of –3, to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus improves by another 2 points, for a total bonus of +6. Natural Attack (Ex):  Beginning at 2nd level, a Green Star adept has ﬂ esh so dense that his unarmed strikes deal substantial damage. He gains a slam attack that deals blud-geoning damage equal to a club sized for the character (1d4 for Small adepts, 1d6 for Medium adepts, or 1d8 for Large adepts), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modi ﬁ er. Unnatural Metabolism (Ex):  When an adept reaches 2nd level, his starmetal infusion begins to radically alter his metabolism. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects. At 5th level, a Green Star adept ’s bonus on saving throws against the attack forms listed above increases to +4. At 8th level, the save bonus increases to +6. Forti ﬁ cation (Ex):  At 3rd level and higher, a Green Star adept has resistance to attacks that affect other living creatures. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the character, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled normally. When an adept reaches 6th level, this ability improves, increasing the chance of negating a critical hit or sneak attack to 50%. At 9th level, a Green Star adept has a 75% chance to negate a critical hit or sneak attack. Otherworldly Vision (Ex):  At 4th level, a Green Star adept gains darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. Null Metabolism (Ex):  When a Green Star adept reaches 7th level, his transformation approaches completion. He no l o n g e r  n e e d s  t o  b r e a t h e ,  e a t ,  o r  s l e e p .  H e  h a s  i m m u n i ty  t o  inhaled poisons, drowning, suffocation, and sleep effects (although he still must rest 8 hours in order to regain spells). In addition, an adept of 7th level or higher is no longer subject to fatigue or exhaustion and ignores the effects of these conditions. Emerald Perfection (Ex):  At 10th level, a Green Star adept completes his transformation. He resembles a perfectly sculpted statue of himself, forged from green starmetal. His type changes to construct, which brings about the following alterations to his basic nature: —An adept loses his Constitution score and any hit point adjustment for Constitution. However, he gains bonus hit points based on his size: +10 hit points for Small, +20 hit points for Medium, or +30 hit points for Large. —Unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept has no special immunity to mind-affecting effects. He is essentially a human mind in a magically animated body. —He gains immunity to poison, paralysis, stunning, disease, extra damage from sneak attacks, death effects, and necromancy effects. —He no longer heals damage on his own, and receives no bene ﬁ t from spells or effects that heal living creatures. However, he can repair himself by means of repair damage spells (see page 120) or his rapid repair ability (see below). —He is no longer subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. —He gains immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects, or is harmless. —He is no longer at risk of death from massive damage, but he is immediately destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points. However, unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept can be returned from the dead by any means that would have worked on him before his ﬁ nal transformation. —He no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. He cannot die of old age and might exist in this form for eons. Rapid Repair (Ex):  A 10th-level Green Star adept repairs 1 point of damage per hour of rest, as long he has at least 1 hit point. Rapid repair does not allow a Green Star adept to regrow or reattach lost body parts. SAMPLE GREEN STAR ADEPT",

Just as exotic substances and mystic words have the power to repel certain creatures, colors also harbor innate properties that can be brought forth by the skilled mage, culminating in the perfection of the prismatic wall  or prismatic sphere.  Few spells match the beauty and power of these potent abjurations. They are perfect defenses, representing a union of magical lore and keen insight into the workings of nature. A master of defensive magic, the Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil approaches the prismatic barrier by mastering one by one its constituent veils or layers. Her skillful wardings can deﬂ ect many of the most perilous attacks enemy spellcasters or monsters can muster, shielding herself and her companions against harm. Her keen insight into the ultimate secrets of abjuration also allows her to easily unbind the defenses of others, and in time she learns the most dreadful of magical attacks: the spectacular and lethal kaleidoscopic doom. Initiates of the Sevenfold Veil are a loose society or fellow- ship of spellcasters who share this common obsession. They correspond regularly and meet at odd intervals, interested not only in the lore of their chosen specialty but also in the lore of the physical world and how magic and mundane knowledge intertwine. Most initiates are wizards, since the careful study of the magical and the mundane appeals more to the wizard ’s intellect than to the sorcerer ’s forceful personality. Initiates of the Sevenfold Veil adventure for much the same reason that wizards do: to increase their knowledge and understanding. Their warding abilities make them outstand- ing spell duelists, so many neutral- and good-aligned NPC initiates devote their careers to the defeat of evil spellcasters, aiding folk who have no other defense against a dangerous necromancer or reckless conjurer. Evil NPC initiates some- times serve as duelists-for-hire, seeking to entice good wizards into offering some insult or slight in an effort to challenge the marks to lethal spell duels.",

Weapon and Armor Pro ﬁ ciency:  Initiates of the Seven- fold Veil gain no pro ﬁ ciency with any weapon or armor. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  At each level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Warding (Sp):  An Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil can create a warding . She can choose one veil she knows (see below) to be imbued in the warding.  A warding lasts for a certain amount of time as indicated in its description, unless it is dismissed (the same way a spell is dismissed; see page 176 of the Player ’s Handbook ). When she creates a warding,  she can choose one of three types. 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   44 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   44 9/15/04   2:59:19 PM 9/15/04   2:59:19 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 45 Personal:  This warding  is a sphere whose diameter is equal to an initiate ’s space (5 feet for Small or Medium creatures, 10 feet for Large, and so on) and encapsulates the initiate. It moves with her, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by attempting to grapple an enemy). I f  s h e  d o e s  f o r c e  a  c r e a t u r e  t o  p a s s  t h r o u g h ,  t h e  warding has no effect on that creature. Any creature striking at her with a melee weapon or natural attack is subject to the veil ’s effect (although creatures using reach weapons are not). The warding  provides concealment to the initiate, but she can see out with no hin- drance. It lasts for 1 minute per level or until dismissed. Area:  An area warding  affects an initiate ’s space and all a d j a c e n t  s q u ar e s  ( a  s p h e r e  1 5  f e e t  in  d i am e t e r  f o r  a  S m all  or Medium initiate, 20 feet in diameter for a Large initiate, and so on). Any creature who remains adjacent to the initi-ate gains the bene ﬁ t of the warding ’s protection, even if part of its body lies outside the sphere. Moving out of the warding (stepping away from the initiate) is completely safe, but any- one attempting to enter the warding —even someone who was formerly inside it and left —becomes subject to the effects of the chosen veil. The warding  moves with the initiate, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for ex- ample, by moving adjacent to an enemy).

        "description":  "An initiate of 3rd level or higher can create a yellow veil. This veil prevents gases or clouds from entering the warded area, and it defeats petri ﬁ cation attacks. In addi- tion, a character inside a personal or area warding  imbued with a yellow veil has immunity to poison introduced from outside the warding  ( s u c h  a s  f r o m  a  c r e a t u r e  w i t h  a n  e n v e n o m e d weapon striking through the barrier). A creature crossing a yellow veil takes 80 points of electricity damage (Re ﬂ ex half). A disintegrate  spell destroys theveil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Green Veil:  A 4th-level initiate masters the green veil. This veil stops the passage of breath weapons. A creature crossing a green veil must succeed on a Fortitude save or die; on a successful save, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. This veil is a poison effect. A passwall  spell destroys a green veil. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Blue Veil:  At 5th level, an initiate learns the blue veil. This veil blocks all divinations and mind-affecting spells and abilities. Any creature crossing a blue veil must succeed on a Fortitude save or be petri ﬁ ed. A magic missile  spell destroys a blue veil but is negated by it. A warding with this is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Indigo Veil:  A 6th-level initiate can create the mighty indigo veil. This veil prevents the passage of all spells or s p e l l - l i k e  a b i l i t i e s .  A n y  c r e a t u r e  c r o s s i n g  a n  i n d i g o  v e i l  must succeed on a Will save or become confused,  as if by an insanity  spell. A daylight  spell negates and is negated by an indigo veil. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell. Violet Veil:  At 7th level, an initiate masters the seventh and ﬁ nal veil: the violet veil. This barrier destroys all objects and effects that cross it, as if they were disintegrated.  Living creatures passing a violet veil must succeed on a Will save or be shifted to a random place on a random plane (as the plane shift  spell). A violet veil is destroyed by a successful dispel magic  spell. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Unimpeachable Abjuration (Ex):  An initiate ’s abjuration spells are particularly dif ﬁ cult to defeat with spells or effects that dispel them. An initiate can add her class level to the DC to dispel any abjuration spell or effect she creates. Unanswerable Strike (Ex):  Due to her study of magical defenses, an initiate learns how to defeat them more easily. At 2nd level and higher, she gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to counter or dispel abjuration spells. At 6th level, this bonus increases to a +4 bonus. Reactive Warding (Sp):  At 4th level, an initiate learns to create a warding  (see above) in response to an attack. She can raise a warding  as an immediate action (see page 86), after an opponent begins an action but before it is completed. F o r exam p l e, if s h e sees an en em y w arrio r chargin g h e r , she can raise a warding to protect herself. The opponent can choose to continue the charge through the warding or can halt outside it. Double Warding:  At 6th level and higher, an initiate can raise two veils at once any time she creates a warding.  This still counts as only one use of her warding  ability. The less powerful effect (progressing from red up through violet) is always considered to be “outside ” the more powerful effect, so a double warding consisting of a blue veil and a green veil would subject any creature passing through to the green veil ﬁ rst, followed by the blue veil. To negate the entire warding, the outermost veil must be negated before the inner veil can be negated. Kaleidoscopic Doom (Sp):  At 7th level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom.  Once per day as a standard action, she designates one 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   46 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   46 9/15/04   2:59:25 PM 9/15/04   2:59:25 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 47creature within 60 feet and turns magical effects currently affecting the creature against it. This effect functions like a targeted greater dispel magic,  except that for every spell or effect negated on the target, the effect of one veil (see above) is visited on the victim as if the subject had crossed it. The veils created around the victim proceed through the spectrum from red to violet, with one veil activated per spell negated. Thus, a creature with three spells negated would be subject to the effects of the red, orange, and yellow veils. The subject is still entitled to the normal saving throws allowed by each veil. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. SAMPLE INITIATE OF THE SEVENFOLD VEIL",

Using his guild focus, a mage of the Arcane Order can “call” spells from this common resource as needed. Calling a Spell:  Calling a spell from the Spellpool can be done at any distance but requires the caster to have an open, unused spell slot of the appropriate level. Wizards preparing spells for the day decide at that time whether to leave some spell slots open. A spellcaster can call only for a spell of a level that he could normally cast. He can call a number of spells per day whose total levels are equal to or less than half his caster level (round down, minimum one). For example, Turial Edemont, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level mage of the Arcane Order can call one 4th-level spell per day, two 2nd-level spells per day, or any other combina-tion of spells whose levels do not exceed four, assuming he has slots available and his Spellpool debt isn ’t too high (see below). When a caster calls a spell, he takes a full-round action to concentrate on his focus (which provokes attacks of opportu-nity). The spell appears in the caster ’s mind at the beginning of his next turn and can be used immediately. However, if he does not cast the called spell within a number of minutes equal to his caster level, it fades from his mind as though cast. A wizard cannot learn a called spell, despite its temporary presence in his consciousness, though of course he could later attempt to learn the spell through standard means. Spell Availability:  Three stages of access to the Spellpool exist. A member first joining the Order gains Spellpool I privileges, which grants access to spells of 1st to 3rd level. Spellpool II allows access to 4th- to 6th-level spells, and Spellpool III grants access to 7th- to 9th-level spells. No 0-level spells are available, but the Spellpool can provide any other spell on the wizard/sor-cerer spell list in the Player’s Handbook,  as well as any additional spells designated by the DM. Spellpool Debt: Every time a spellcaster calls a spell, he incurs a debt. He must return an “energy packet ” to the Spell- pool: a spell he has prepared of a level equal level to that of the called spell, or a number of spells whose combined levels equal the level of the called spell. For instance, the Spellpool debt for a 5th-level spell is five levels, which could be paid off with another 5th-level spell or any combination of spells whose levels total five. Returning a spell is a full-round action, like calling a spell, and depletes a prepared spell slot as if the spell had been cast. The debt must be repaid within a number of days equal to the character ’s class level; otherwise, the mage ’s access to the Spellpool is automatically suspended. Once the debt is repaid, a suspended caster immediately regains access to the Spellpool —except that failure to pay off a debt within one year results in a spellcaster ’s expulsion from the Order. A mage can’t run a “positive balance ” with the Spellpool, paying off a debt before incurring it. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 49each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.",

Skill Points at Each Level:  2 + Int modi ﬁ er. Class Features All the following are class features of the mindbender prestige class. Weapon and Armor Pro ﬁ ciency:  Mindbenders gain no proﬁ ciency with any weapon or armor. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  At each odd-numbered level, a mindbender gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a mindbender, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Telepathy (Su):  A mindbender unlocks one of the most basic elements of his mental craft at 1st level, gaining the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. Skill Boost (Ex):  A mindbender is a consummate student of manipulation, be it magical or mundane. Beginning at 2nd level, he can add 1/2 his class level as a competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks. Push the Weak Mind (Sp):  At 2nd level and higher, a mindbender can in ﬂ uence the actions of a living creature of Large or smaller size once per day. This ability functions like a suggestion  spell, except that the range is 100 feet and the duration is 5 hours plus 1 hour per class level. The mind-bender can communicate the suggested course of action telepathically if he chooses, which allows him to use the effect regardless of the target ’s language. A successful Will save (DC 13 + primary spellcasting ability modi ﬁ er) negates the effect. (Primary spellcasting ability is Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and warlocks, Wisdom for clerics, and so forth.) A mindbender can use this ability one additional time per day per three class levels gained (two times per day at 5th and three times per day at 8th). Mindread (Sp):  At 3rd level and higher, a mindbender can read the surface thoughts of a living creature within 100 feet. This is a mind-affecting ability that requires a standard action to use. The mindbender must be able to see the target; a successful Will save (DC 12 + primary spellcasting ability modi ﬁ er) negates the effect. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have only simple, instinctual thoughts. Maintaining the effect requires concentration; the maximum duration is 10 minutes. The ability can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. This effect is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. A mindbender can use this ability two times per day at 3rd level and four times per day at 7th level. Eternal Charm (Sp):  At 4th level and higher, a mind- bender can charm  any single Large or smaller living creature within 100 feet (as charm monster ) once per day. A successful Will save (DC 14 + primary spellcasting ability modi ﬁ er) negates the effect. The duration is permanent; however, a mindbender can have only one creature so charmed  at any given time. If he attempts to use this power on a creature while he has another so charmed,  the ﬁ rst charm  is auto- matically broken (regardless of the success of the second attempt). The effect is also broken if a mindbender or one of his allies injures the target. Dispel magic  has no effect on an eternal charm,  though break enchantment  frees the victim (treat the mindbender ’s caster level as 5 + his class level for this purpose). At 6th level and higher, a mindbender can have up to two creatures affected by this power at any given time; if he attempts to charm  a third, the previous victim under his inﬂ uence the longest is freed. At 8th level, he can control up to three creatures with this ability, and at 10th level up to four creatures.

This increase improves to 4 at 10th level. Dominate (Sp):  At 7th level, a mindbender becomes able to dominate  any single living Large or smaller creature within 100 feet (as dominate monster ) once per day. A successful Will save (DC 19 + primary spellcasting ability modi ﬁ er) negates the effect. The duration is 24 hours. Thrall (Su):  At 10th level, a mindbender ’s mental mastery reaches its pinnacle. He can choose to make the duration of his dominate  ability (see above) permanent, but only on one target at a time. If a mindbender chooses to dominate  another creature and make that effect permanent, the previous thrall is freed from the effect. SAMPLE MINDBENDER",

        "description":  "A sublime chord expands her repertoire of bardic music to encompass new songs or poetics of strange and wondrous power. These effects function just as the bardic music effects described in the Player’s Handbook.  Each use of a sublime chord song expends one daily use of the character ’s bardic music ability. A sublime chord adds one-half her class level (rounded down) to her bard level to determine her number of daily uses of bardic music. Song of Arcane Power (Su):  A sublime chord of 2nd level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill learns how to use her bardic music to assist her spellcasting. As a move action, she can prepare to cast a spell by giving voice to the song of power. The next spell she casts gains a bonus to its caster level based on the result of the sublime chord ’s Perform check: Perform Check Result Caster Level Increase 9 or lower +010 to 19 +120 to 29 +230 or higher +4 The spell to be enhanced by the song of arcane power must be cast by the end of the sublime chord ’s next turn, or else the song fades with no effect (other than consuming a bardic music use). Song of Timelessness (Su):  A sublime chord of 6th level or higher with 16 or more ranks in a Perform skill knows the song of timelessness. As a standard action, she can envelop a  s in gl e  c r e a tur e  wi thin  6 0  f e e t  in  a  ﬁ eld of timelessness, provided she has line of effect to the target (see page 176 of the Player ’s Handbook ).

If the subject fails its save, it is frozen in a shimmering aura of timelessness and can take no actions. However, no force can affect it —weapons cannot reach it, spells that target it automatically fail, and if the ground it is standing on is somehow taken away, it would not even begin to fall. A sublime chord can keep her target frozen in time for as long as she maintains the power by continuing to perform, up to a maximum of 1 minute per level. When she stops performing, the subject immediately returns to normal. As far as the creature is concerned, no time seems to have passed. Song of Cosmic Fire ( Su ):  A 10th-level sublime chord with 20 or more ranks in a Perform skill learns the song of cosmic ﬁ re. Using this abil- ity costs a sublime chord two of her daily uses of bardic music. The song of cosmic ﬁ re creates a 20-foot-radius spread of fire anywhere within 100 feet of the sublime chord (provided she has line of effect to the ﬁ re’s point of origin). Creatures in the area take damage equal to the sublime chord ’s Perform check result. All affected creatures are entitled to a Re ﬂ ex save (DC 10 + sublime chord level + Cha modi-ﬁ er) for half damage. SAMPLE SUBLIME CHORD",

Suloise sorcerers delved d e e p  in t o  a r c a n e  l o r e  t h a t  o t h e r  f o lk  a v o i d e d ,  u n e a r t h i n g  m a n y  d a r k  a n d  dangerous secrets in the process. The Suel Empire was ruled by noble families headed by mages of unsurpassed power, and the countless rivalries and vendettas between these families led to the rise of an elite school of combat training: the way of the arcanamach. Conditioned for loyalty, determination, and absolute obedience, arcanamachs were skillful warriors who studied arcane magic for the express purpose of learning how to slay powerful wizards. In the days of the Suel Empire, the arcanamachs were guards for their archmage masters, serving the greatest Suel wizards with sword and spell. They were also assassins and spies trained to slay powerful wizards of rival families, as well as defend the wizards of their own families. In hundreds of secret duels of spell and steel, arcanamachs practiced their arts against others of their kind, learning their skills from hidden arcanamach academies. While the Suel Empire is long dead, the tradition of the arcanamach still survives in a rare set of magical tomes: the Grimoire Arcanamacha . No academies for these warrior- wizards remain, but a skilled swordsman who studies from the Grimoire Arcanamacha —o r  w h o  l e a rn s  f r o m  a  m a s t e r who has studied the Grimoire —can unlock many secrets of stealth, alertness, mental fortitude, and combative spellcasting. While the arcanamachs formerly existed as elite guards and agents for powerful wizards, those who follow the tradition in the modern day retain no special allegiance to other arcanists. Suel arcanamach NPCs are spies and assassins, secre-tive individuals who excel at using stealth, spells, and swordplay to achieve their goals. Some are dedicated mage-slayers who make a career out of destroying other spellcasters.",

        "description":  "A Suel arcanamach has the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a Suel arcanamach spell, he must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell ’s level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + his Cha modi ﬁ er. When he gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for 1st level), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. He has access to any spell of the abjuration, divination, illusion, and transmutation schools on the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He casts spells just as a sorcerer does, including the ability to replace a known Suel arcanamach spell with a new spell at every even-numbered class level beginning at 4th. Ignore Spell Failure Chance (Ex):  A Suel arcanamach ’s practice at merging spellcasting and swordplay results in a reduction in the arcane spell failure chance associated with using armor or shields. This reduction starts at 5% at 1st level and increases by 5% every three levels thereafter. The arcanamach subtracts the given percentage value from his total spell failure chance, if any. For example, a 1st-level ar-canamach wearing a mithral shirt has a spell failure chance of 5%, not 10%. This ability only functions when the char-acter casts a Suel arcanamach spell. Tenacious Spells (Ex):  An arcanamach ’s Suel arcanamach spells are particularly dif ﬁ cult to dispel; add 6 to the DC required to dispel the character ’s arcanamach spells. Dispelling Strike (Su):  Once per day, a Suel arcanamach of 2nd level or higher can attempt a dispelling strike with one normal melee attack. If he hits, he deals normal dam- age, and the victim is subject to a targeted greater dispel magic. The arcanamach ’s dispel check is 1d20 + class level + 6. If a Suel arcanamach makes a dispelling strike against a creature with no spells or effects to dispel, the dispelling strike has no effect, but the ability is used up for that day. At 6th level, an arcanamach can use this power two times per day, and at 10th level he can use it three times per day. Extended Spellstrength (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, a Suel arcanamach knows how to extend the duration of spells that he casts on himself. The duration of any of his Suel arcanamach spells with which he targets himself is doubled, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat (but without any adjustment to the spell ’s effective level or casting time).

Spells that target multiple targets are affected by this pow- er, but only the arcanamach gains the extended duration. For example, a 5th-level arcanamach who casts haste  would be hasted for 10 rounds, while his allies would gain the effect only for the normal 5-round duration. Spells that do not have a Target entry are unaffected by this power even if the arcanamach is the only one affected. SAMPLE SUEL ARCANAMACH",

Unlike spellcasters of other prestigious associations, a wayfarer guide need not devote years of her life to the art of teleportation nor focus her attention overmuch on the pursuit of perfection. Still, she learns secrets of the trade that are available only through employment with the Wayfarers Union. The Union is, at its heart, a transportation service that specialty spellcasters provide for those willing to pay. Most wayfarer guides are wizards or sorcerers, though a few clerics with access to the Travel domain have been known to pursue this class. Such characters typically have a level or two in bard, ranger, or wizard to meet the Knowledge requirements more quickly, Wayfarers Union of ﬁ ces are generally found in large cities, staffed by wayfarer guides who offer a variety of standard services. Particularly quali ﬁ ed NPC wayfarer guides, called “danger wayfarers, ” are sometimes available to teleport bold clients into dangerous locales, though the price is commen-surately higher. Adaptation:  This prestige class is quick and to the point. However, even wayfarers have their disputes. Perhaps in your campaign no single Wayfarers Union exists. Instead, many splintered groups each claim particular areas of geography as theirs, and they bitterly contest the “illegal ” transporta- tion of goods or travelers in their territory by other groups. Those who can smuggle goods or travelers into areas held by opposing wayfarers or state-sanctioned wayfarers would become probable in such a campaign. Hit Die:  d6. Requirements To qualify to become a wayfarer guide, a character must ful ﬁ ll all the following criteria.",

Class Features All the following are class features of the wayfarer guide prestige class. Weapon and Armor Pro ﬁ ciency:  Wayfarer guides gain no pro ﬁ ciency with any weapon or armor. Spells per Day/Spells Known:  At 1st and 3rd level, a wayfarer guide gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcast-ing class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a wayfarer guide, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Enhanced Capacity (Ex):  A wayfarer guide can transport material more ef ﬁ ciently. When casting any spell with the teleportation descriptor that allows other willing creatures to be brought along, a wayfarer guide can bring along one additional Medium touched willing creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per class level, subject to the same restrictions given in the teleport spell description. For example, a 9th-level wizard/2nd-level wayfarer guide can bring up to ﬁ ve other Medium or smaller creatures with her (instead of the nor-mal limit of three creatures for an 11th-level caster). Improved Range (Ex):  A wayfarer guide can travel great- er distances when teleporting. When the character casts any spell with the teleportation descriptor, the maximum dis- tance covered by the spell increases by 50%. For example, a 9th-level wizard/ 1st-level wayfarer guide can teleport up to 1,500 miles with a single teleport  spell (instead of the normal limit of 1,000 miles for a 10th-level caster).",

Speak with Mustelids (Ex):  Deriko can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties). Speak with Master (Ex):  Deriko can com- municate verbally with Erbera. Other creatures do not understand the com- munication without magical help.

Alertness (Ex):  Deriko grants its master Alertness as long as it is within 5 feet. Empathic Link (Su):  Erbera can communicate telepathically with her familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile. The master has the same connection to an item or a place that the familiar does. Share Spells (Su):  Erbera may have any spell she casts on herself also affect her familiar if the latter is within 5 feet at the time.

        "description":  "A wild mage casts spells differently from any other arcane spellcaster. She reduces her caster level by 3 for all spells she casts from now on. However, every time she casts a spell, her use of wild magic adds 1d6 to her adjusted caster level. For example, an 8th-level sorcerer/1st-level wild mage has a base caster level of 6th, not 9th, but her actual caster level varies from 7th to 12th for every spell she casts. Caster level affects all level-based variables of a spell, including spell penetration checks. Random De ﬂ ector (Su):  At 2nd level and higher, a wild mage has the ability to protect herself from certain attacks with this ability. Using this ability is an immediate action (see page 86), which means that a wild mage activates it when it is not her turn. When activated, the random de ﬂ ector lasts until the beginning of the wild mage ’s next turn. The random de ﬂ ector redirects ranged attacks, ranged touch attacks, and individually targeted spells (spells desig-nating the wild mage as the sole target, but not area spells striking an area in which she happens to be the sole target) so that they instead attack or affect a random target within 20 feet of the wild mage. A wild mage includes herself and her allies among the possible new targets. Any creature targeted by a de ﬂ ected attack is attacked or affected normally, so an attack roll is made normally against the new target ’s AC, the new target receives a saving throw if a spell or effect allows one, and so on. A wild mage can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, two times per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level. Student of Chaos (Ex):  Whenever a wild mage of 3rd level or higher uses a magic item that offers a randomly determined effect (such as a bag of tricks  or rod of wonder ), she can roll twice and choose between the two results. If a random roll is made only once to determine the nature or contents of a device (for example, a robe of useful items  or an iron ﬂ ask), a wild mage gains no special advantage. 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   69 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   69 9/15/04   3:01:25 PM 9/15/04   3:01:25 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 70Chaotic Mind (Su):  When a wild mage reaches 6th level, the power of chaos infuses her mind. She gains immunity to confusion  and insanity  spells and effects, and she is shielded by a continuous nondetection effect (as the spell). Reckless Dweomer (Su):  At 9th level and higher, a wild mage knows how to spontaneously convert her own spell energy into random, unpredictable results. As a standard action, she can eliminate a prepared spell or spell slot of at least 1st level to create an effect similar to that of activating a rod of wonder.  The character ’s student of chaos ability (see above) applies when she uses her reckless dweomer ability. See page 237 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide  for details on the rod of wonder. Wildstrike (Sp):  A t  1 0 t h  l e v e l ,  a  w i l d  m a g e  g a i n s  t h e ability to make a wildstrike  once per day. A wildstrike  affects a single creature within 60 feet, surrounding the creature in an aura of shimmering rainbow colors for 2d6 rounds. Spell resistance applies, but the target receives no saving throw. While a wildstrike  is in effect, there is a 50% chance each time the affected creature casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability that its intended action fails. Instead, the creature rolls as if it had activated a rod of wonder  (see page 237 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide ). SAMPLE WILD MAGE",

        "description":  "Except as noted above, metamagic feats can ’t generally be used to modify spell-like abilities or invocations. CASTER LEVEL In the context of a feat or a prestige class requirement, a caster level prerequisite (such as “caster level 5th ”) measures the character ’s ability to channel a minimum amount of magical power. For feats or prestige classes requiring a minimum caster level, creatures that use spell-like abilities or invoca-tions instead of spells use either their ﬁ xed caster level or their class level to determine quali ﬁ cation. For example, Craft Wondrous Item has a requirement of caster level 3rd, so both a 3rd-level warlock and a nixie (caster level 4th for its charm person  spell-like ability) meet the requirement. SPELLCASTING LEVEL Beyond the limits of magical power, a spellcasting level requirement measures the size and complexity of the spells that can be encompassed within a character ’s mind. As s p e l l s  i n c r e a s e  i n  l e v e l , they become exponen- tially more complicated, requiring a discipline of thought and an under- standing of principles impossible for low-level char- acters to learn. Wizards master these advanced principles through careful study; sorcerers and other spontaneous arcane casters intuit what they need to know as their spellcasting experience grows. Characters or creatures that use spell-like abilities or invocations never learn the arcane circumlocutions of logic and mental training necessary for advanced spellcasting. As such, requirements for feats and prestige classes based on speci ﬁ c levels of spells cast ( “Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells, ” for example) cannot be met by spell-like abilities or invocations —not even spell-like abilities or invocations that allow a character to use a speci ﬁ c arcane spell of the appropriate level or higher.SPECIFIC SPELL REQUIREMENTS A requirement based on a speci ﬁ c spell measures whether the character or creature in question is capable of producing the necessary effect, and as such, invocations and spell-like abilities that generate the relevant effect meet the require-ments for speci ﬁ c spell knowledge. For example, a prestige class with a spellcasting requirement of “Must know (or be able to cast) darkness ” is met by a warlock who chooses darkness as one of her invocations, or by any creature with darkness as a spell-like ability. FEATS AND WEAPONLIKE SPELLS Any spell that requires an attack roll and deals damage func- tions as a weapon in certain respects. As such, several feats that improve weapon performance can be used to enhance weaponlike spells. WEAPONLIKE SPELLS For the purpose of taking combat-enhanc- ing feats, weaponlike spells fall into two categories —ranged spells and touch spells.",

Bene ﬁ t: As a full-round action, you can wield a wand in each hand (if you have both hands free), with one wand des-ignated as your primary wand and the other your secondary wand. Each use of the secondary wand expends 2 charges from it instead of 1. DRACONIC BREATH  [DRACONIC] You can convert your arcane spells into a breath weapon. Prerequisite:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: As a standard action, you can change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon of your draconic heritage energy type. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone ( ﬁ re or cold) or a 60-foot line (acid or electricity) that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you expended to create the effect. Any creature in the area can make a Re ﬂ ex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha modi ﬁ er) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability. DRACONIC CLAW [DRACONIC] You develop the natural weapons of your draconic ances-tors. Prerequisite:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: You gain claws. You can make a natural attack with your claw, dealing damage based on your size (Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8). In any round when you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can make a single claw attack as a swift action (see page 86) against an opponent you threaten.

This extra damage applies only to the ﬁ rst successful attack of spells that create multiple rays or missiles, or to the ﬁ rst round of damage for spells that deal damage over multiple rounds on a single successful attack (such as Melf ’s acid arrow ). Because you must be able to strike precisely, the extra damage applies only to targets within 30 feet. Only spells that deal hit point damage can be affected by this feat. RECKLESS WAND WIELDER You can increase the effectiveness of spells cast from a wand. Prerequisites:  Use Magic Device 1 rank, Craft Wand. Bene ﬁ t: By expending an additional charge, you can use a wand as if its caster level was 2 higher than its normal level, changing all the spell ’s level-dependent effects. For example, by expending 2 charges at once, a wand of magic missile  (created at caster level 3rd) can be used at caster level 5th, ﬁ ring three missiles instead of two. You can expend only 1 extra charge at a time using this feat. REPEAT SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can cast a spell that repeats on the following round. Prerequisite:  Any metamagic feat. Bene ﬁ t: A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your turn in the following round. No matter where you might have moved in the previous round, the second spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the original spell.

Such creatures include ethereal creatures, creatures that are blinking  or shadow walking , manifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space of a rope trick, portable hole, or familiar pocket  (see page 106).

Bene ﬁ t: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack with a wand, expending one charge to deal 1d6 points of damage to the creature struck. You apply no extra damage to this attack regardless of its source (including sneak attack, favored enemy, and smite bonuses), but you can activate the wand as part of the attack. If the spell cast from the wand is a ray or a targeted spell, the creature struck is the spell ’s target (with ray spells hitting automatically). If the spell affects an area or creates a spread, you can designate the spell ’s point of origin at any grid intersection point of the creature ’s space (but doing so might put you in the affected area).

Likewise, a weaponlike spell that deals normal damage can ’t be used to deal nonlethal damage or vice versa (except when modi ﬁ ed by the Nonlethal Substitution feat or in accordance with the speci ﬁ c regulations of a nonlethal spell duel as described on page 176). CRITICAL HITS Unless the spell description says otherwise, a weapon- like spell threatens a critical hit on a roll of 20 and deals double damage with a critical hit. Only damage that the spell deals in the round it strikes is increased by a critical hit. For example, if you score a critical hit with Melf’s acid arrow , only damage dealt in the ﬁ rst round of the spell ’s duration is doubled. Some weaponlike spells depend on a saving throw to determine the damage doubled on a criti- cal hit. For example, disintegrate  deals 2d6 points of damage per caster level on a failed Fortitude save, but o nl y 5 d6 poin ts of damag e o n a successful save. If a critical hit is scored and the target makes its saving throw, it takes 10d6 points of damage; on a failed save, it takes 4d6 points of damage per caster level, and in both cases is disintegrated if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the spell.agic is the weapons, armor, and tools of the trade for an arcane caster, and an arcanist ’s selection of spells and the skill with which she wields them can de ﬁ ne her even more distinctly than a master warrior ’s choice of tactics and blade. This chapter presents over 140 new arcane spells, a number of which support the classes and prestige classes introduced in Chapters 1 and 2. Some are updates and revi-sions of spells that appeared prior to D UNGEONS  \u0026 D RAGONS v.3.5, with others appearing here for the ﬁ rst time to round out and support particular niches and effects in the various schools of magic. WEAPONLIKE SPELLS Any spell that requires an attack roll and deals damage functions as a weapon in certain respects, whether the spell deals normal hit point damage, nonlethal damage, ability damage, or energy drain. Such spells can threaten critical hits, can be used in sneak attacks, and can be used with favored enemy damage bonuses. You can even use a number of combat-enhancing feats from the Player ’s Handbook to improve the effectiveness of weaponlike spells, as noted in Chapter 3 of this book. All such spells deal damage as spells, not weapons, so Strength modi ﬁ ers to damage and magical effects that increase 85Illus. by M. Cavotta Illus. by M. Cavotta 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   85 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   85 9/15/04   3:03:26 PM 9/15/04   3:03:26 PMCHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONS 86 Extra damage from a critical hit is of the same type the spell deals normally. For example, ray of frost deals 1d3 points of cold damage, so a critical hit deals 2d3 points of cold damage. Likewise, a critical hit with an energy-draining spell deals twice its normal damage. A critical hit with an enervation spell bestows 2d4 negative levels, for example. Spells that require attack rolls but do not deal actual damage cannot score critical hits. For example, ray of enfeeblement requires a ranged touch attack roll, but since the target of the spell takes a penalty to Strength (rather than Strength damage), the spell cannot score a critical hit. Chill touch , on the other hand, deals 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage (not a Strength penalty) unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw, and so would deal 2d6 points of damage plus 2 points of Strength damage on a critical hit with a failed save. SNEAK ATTACKS Any weaponlike spell can be used to make a sneak attack, including ranged spells used against targets within 30 feet (just as with any other ranged sneak attack). A successful sneak attack with a weaponlike spell deals extra damage of the same type as the spell normally deals. For example, a 10th-level rogue/3rd-level wizard who makes a successful sneak attack with Melf ’s acid arrow  deals 2d4 points of acid damage, plus an extra 5d6 points of acid damage for the sneak attack (with the spell continuing to deal acid damage as normal in subsequent rounds). The exception is spells that deal energy drain or ability damage, which deal negative energy damage on a sneak attack, not extra negative levels or ability damage. For example, a 5th-level rogue/8th-level sorcerer who makes a successful enervation  sneak attack bestows 1d4 negative levels and deals 3d6 points of negative energy damage. If a sneak attack with a weaponlike spell results in a critical hit, the spell damage is doubled, but not the extra damage (as with any sneak attack critical hit).Multiple Hits Some weaponlike spells can strike multiple times in the same round. When the caster gets a bonus on damage with such spells (including sneak attack damage), the extra damage applies only to the ﬁ rst attack, whether that attack hits or not. For example, a 7th-level sorcerer/3rd-level rogue with Point Blank Shot makes a scorching ray  attack at less than 30 feet (two rays, each requiring a ranged touch attack roll and dealing 4d6 points of ﬁ re damage). If the ﬁ rst ray hits, it deals 6d6+1 points of ﬁ re damage (4d6 normal + 2d6 sneak attack + 1 for Point Blank Shot), while each subsequent ray deals only 4d6 points of ﬁ re damage whether the ﬁ rst ray hits or not. SPELL LISTS The following section presents new spells for assassins, bards, clerics, druids, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards.  It also features complete spell lists for the warmage and wu jen. * Any spell in the warmage and wu jen spell lists marked by an asterisk is a new spell, described in this chapter. For all other warmage and wu jen spells, see Chapter 11 of the Player ’s Handbook . An M or F appearing at the end of a spell ’s name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell com-ponent pouch. An X denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the caster. Spell Name Changes:  A few spells ’ names have been slightly changed from previous appearances to make them easier to ﬁ nd in the chapter. The lesser orb  spells, previously found in Tome and Blood  and Miniatures Handbook  (lesser acid orb, lesser cold orb , etc.) are now listed as “lesser orb of [energy type], ” while the orb spells, previously found in Tome and Blood (acid orb, cold orb,  etc.), are now listed as “orb of [energy type]. ” Any reference to an older version of the spell name applies pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs SWIFT AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS Some of the feats, spells, and items in Complete Arcane  and other DUNGEONS  \u0026 D RAGONS  supplements use two new action types: the swift action and the immediate action. A description of how each works follows. Swift Action:  A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve spellcasting or the activation of magic items; many characters (especially those who don’t cast spells) never have an opportunity to take a swift action. Casting a quickened spell is a swift action (instead of a free action, as stated in the Quicken Spell feat description in the Play- er’s Handbook ). In addition, casting any spell with a casting time of 1 swift action (such as aiming at the target) is a swift action. Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Immediate Action:  Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. How- ever, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any time —even if it ’s not your turn. Casting feather fall is an immediate action (instead of a free action, as stated in the spell description in the Player ’s Handbook ), since the spell can be cast at any time. Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   86 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   86 9/15/04   3:03:31 PM 9/15/04   3:03:31 PMCHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONS 87equally to the new spell name. For example, a wizard with lesser ﬁ re orb  in her spellbook should update that to lesser orb of ﬁ re.

The wielder gets no warning or knowledge of the spell ’s effect on his weapon, and though he makes the attack, the self-dealt damage can ’t be consciously reduced (though damage reduction applies) or changed to nonle- thal damage. Once the weapon attacks its wielder (whether successfully or not), the spell is discharged. The spell can target a weapon of any size as long as its wielder normally uses it as a two-handed weapon or a reach weapon. For example, a Small longspear wielded by a hal ﬂ ing could be the target of the spell, but not the same Small longspear wielded by a human; in the human ’s hands, the weapon is too small to twist around and strike its wielder.

You can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. You are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for posi-tive energy, negative energy, force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Non damaging spell effects affect you normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (such as implosion ) or they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (such as a web or wall of stone  spell). As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a de ﬂ ection bonus equal to your Cha- risma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). You can enter or pass through solid objects while in ghostform,  but you m ust remain ad jacen t to th e object ’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects w i t h i n  a  s q u a r e  a d j a c e n t  t o  y o u r current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect. While under the effect of ghostform, your attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although de ﬂ ection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor ) work nor- mally against you. Your nonmagical a t t a c k s  h a v e  n o  e f f e c t  o n  c o r p o r e a l  targets, and any attack you make with a magic weapon against a corporeal target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks you make with a ghost touch weapon, while are made normally (no miss chance). Spells you cast while in ghostform  affect corporeal targets normally, including spells that require you to make an attack roll (such as rays or melee touch spells). You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled. In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in ghostform  and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. You move silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if you don ’t wish to be while in ghostform.  You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modi ﬁ er applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you.

A lightning blade  is the size of a normal longsword but virtually weightless, and it is treated as a martial weapon for the purpose of determining whether the wielder is pro ﬁ cient with it. The wielder can use the blade to deal electricity damage with a melee touch attack, or to ﬁ re a 30-foot line of lightning as a ranged touch attack. During the spell ’s duration, the blade can deal up to 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). For each attack roll, the blade ’s wielder decides how many dice of damage the blade will deal on a successful hit, up to the maximum damage potential remaining in the spell. On a success- ful attack, the blade deals the specified damage to the target. If the attack misses, the damage is lost. The wielder ’s Strength modi ﬁ er does not apply to any damage done with a lightning blade . The spell does not function underwater. LOW-LIGHT VISION Transmutation",

        "description":  "No A shimmering magnetic ray springs from your hand and pulls iron or steel objects to your grasp. Once per round on a successful ranged touch attack, the magnetic ray can draw an object toward you with an effective Strength score of 30 (and so can target items weighing up to 8,000 pounds). Any unattended and unsecured item ﬂ ies directly and safely to your hand (or to the edge of your space if too large to be wielded), but drawing an item toward you that another creature is holding (such as a weapon) requires a successful disarm attempt (see page 155 of the Player ’s Handbook ). You use the ray ’s Strength modi ﬁ er (+10) in place of your own, and such attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if you use magnetism against a creature in an adjacent square, although casting the spell might still provoke attacks of opportunity. If you succeed on the disarm attempt, the weapon ﬂ ies from your opponent ’s hand to your own. If you target an item that is attended but not held, such as a weapon at someone ’s belt, the creature bearing the item gets a Re ﬂ ex save to hang onto it, dropping whatever else is in one hand at the time unless it has a free hand. On a failed save, the item ﬂ ies from the creature ’s hand to your own. Otherwise, make a disarm attempt as above. If an i tem is secur ed in so m e w a y , you can make a Strength check (using the ray ’s +10 bonus) to break or burst whatever holds it. Material Component:  A piece of lode- stone. MELT",

Any creature that has spells prepared, spell slots available for cast- ing without preparation, or innate spell-like abilities must succeed on a Will save or be halted by an invisible barrier that prevents passage. The DC of the Will save increases by a number equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell the creature has prepared or is capable of casting (so that a 10th-level sorcerer who hasn ’t yet exhausted his 5th-level spell slots for the day adds +5 to the save DC). You can choose to designate a password or special condition (such as character race, alignment, possession of a token, or any other observable or detectable characteristic) by which spellcasting characters and creatures can enter the refusal -warded area. Creatures that have no spellcasting capability or spell-like abilities (includ- ing spellcasters who have exhausted their spell slots, and creatures with spell trigger or spell completion magic items) can pass through the barrier with no dif ﬁ culty. Spellcasters and creatures that have spell-like abilities and that are already within the area you protect when you create the ward are not compelled to leave or restricted in their movement within it (and spells and spell-like abilities can pass through the barrier in either direction with no difﬁ culty). However, if such creatures leave the area, they must succeed on saving throws as described above to return. Creatures attempting to use any teleportation spell or effect to enter the warded area make the normal saving throw.

        "description":  "Yes You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception  always strikes from your direction, and so it can’t be used to ﬂ ank along with your regular attack, but it could ﬂ ank along with your allies. The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, deal-ing 1d4 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. In addition, each successful hit provides a –1 penalty on the target ’s next saving throw roll ( –2 on a suc- cessful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of –5 on a single creature) and lasts until the crea- ture is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the bene ﬁ t of a remove curse spell. Each round, a sword of deception  con- tinues to attack the previous round ’s target unless you use a standard action t o  s w i t c h  i t  t o  a  n e w  t a r g e t  w i t h i n range.

The wall can be whatever shape you desire as long as its base is solidly on the ground, but it cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Though solid, the wall has many small openings and gaps, and creatures on either side have cover and concealment against attacks from the opposite side. A wall of bones  can be passed through as a full-round action, but its sharp spikes and edges deal 1d8 points of damage to any Small or Medium creature that attempts to do so. Small creatures can slip and wriggle through the wall at will, but a Medium creature must make a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check. Failure means that a creature takes damage as normal and becomes stuck in the wall. It must make another move attempt the fol-lowing round to either pass through the wall or pull back from it ( taking damage from the movement either way). Tiny or smaller creatures can slip freely through the wall at half speed, and Large or larger creatures cannot pass through it but might be able to break through (see below) or climb over, taking no damage.

WARLOCK INVOCATIONS The invocations available to warlocks are described below. While warlocks are as closely linked to the arcane as any wizard or sorcerer, these special powers are spell-like abili- ties, not spells. A brief description of each invocation is provided in the warlock class description on page 5. These include the blast shape invocations and eldritch essence invocations, which allow a warlock to modify his eldritch blast  attack, as well as all other invocations. In this section, invocations are presented in alphabetical order, much like new spells are presented earlier in this chapter. A short description of each invocation by grade (least, lesser, greater, dark) precedes a complete, detailed description. See page 8 for more information on invocations and page 5 for more information on warlocks. NAME The ﬁ rst line of every invocation description gives the name by which the invocation is generally known. GRADE Below the name, the grade of invocation is provided. War- locks can choose invocations from four grades depending on their class level: least, lesser, greater, and dark. See the warlock class description for more details on when warlocks gain access to invocations of a given grade. LEVEL EQUIVALENT On the same line as the grade, each of the following invoca- tion descriptions contains a spell level equivalent, which affects the save DC for that invocation, Concentration checks made in concert with the invocation, as well as interactions with other spells and abilities, such as globe of invulnerability.  The level equivalent of an invocation is provided after its grade. BLAST SHAPE OR ELDRITCH ESSENCE Some invocations can modify a warlock ’s eldritch blast attack. These invocations are either blast shape invo-cations or eldritch essence invocations. They do not produce an effect on their own like regular invocations, but must be used in conjunction with eldritch blast to generate an effect. If an invocation is a blast shape or eldritch essence invocation, this fact is noted after the level equivalent. 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   130 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   130 9/15/04   3:07:03 PM 9/15/04   3:07:03 PM131CHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONSLEAST INVOCATIONS",

If a creature is holding or wearing the target of the spell and the target is destroyed, the creature must make a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round and deafened for 1 minute by your terrible word. This is a sonic effect. BEGUILING INFLUENCE Least; 2nd You can invoke this ability to beguile and bewitch your foes. You gain a +6 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimi- date checks for a period of 24 hours. BESHADOWED BLAST Lesser; 4th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast  into a beshadowed blast. Any living creature struck by a beshadowed blast must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. BEWITCHING BLAST Greater; 4th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a bewitching blast . Any crea- ture struck by a bewitching blast  must succeed on a Will save or be confused for 1 round in addition to the normal damage from the blast. This is a mind-inﬂ uencing effect. BREATH OF THE NIGHT Least; 1st A misty cloud of fog spreads in a 20-foot radius around you when you use this invocation, as the spell fog cloud.  The fog does not block line of sight, but all creatures in the fog have concealment. A moderate wind or any ﬁ re larger than a torch immediately disperses the fog. The fog disperses on its own after 1 minute.BRIMSTONE BLAST Lesser; 3rd; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a brimstone blast . A brimstone blast deals ﬁ re damage. Any creature struck by a brimstone blast  must succeed on a Reﬂ ex save or catch on ﬁ re, taking 2d6 points of ﬁ re damage per round until it takes a full-round action to extinguish the ﬂ ames or the duration expires. The ﬁ re damage persists for 1 round per ﬁ ve class levels you have. For example, a 15th-level warlock deals 2d6 points of ﬁ re damage for 3 rounds after the initial brimstone blast  attack. A creature burning in this way never takes more than 2d6 points of ﬁ r e  d a m a g e  i n  a round, even if it has been hit by more than one brimstone blast . CHARM Lesser; 4th You can beguile a creature within 60 feet. The creature must succeed on a Will save or instantly come to regard you as its comrade. This is a language-dependent ability. Other than these differences, this ability works as the charm monster  spell. You can never have more than one target charmed at a time with this ability. If a second creature is charmed, you lose your hold on the ﬁ rst creature. CHILLING TENTACLES Greater; 5th This invocation allows you to con-jure forth a ﬁ eld of soul-chilling black tentacles that ooze from the ground, groping for victims. This invocation functions identically to the Evard ’s black tentacles  spell, except that each creature within the area of the invoca-tion takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round. Creatures in the area take this cold damage whether or not they are grappled by the tentacles. CURSE OF DESPAIR Lesser; 4th You can use this invocation to bestow a curse upon a touched opponent (as bestow curse ). Ev en if th e sa v e against this ability succeeds, the creature takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. DARK DISCORPORATION Dark; 8th One with the powers of darkness, you learn to abandon your body. When you use this ability, you becomes a swarm of Diminutive, batlike shadows that ﬁ lls two 10-foot squares (or eight contiguous 5-foot squares, shapeable as you desire). The duration of this ability is 24 hours. In this swarmlike form, you gain the following characteristics and traits. —Abilities: Your Strength score drops to 1, but your Dexterity score increases by 6. —Armor Class: You lose any natural armor or armor bonuses to Armor Class. You gain a +4 size bonus to AC, and a de ﬂ ection bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modi ﬁ er. —Movement: You gain a ﬂ y speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverabil-ity. You can pass through openings a Diminutive creature could pass through. —Swarm Traits: You are not subject t o  c r i t i c a l  h i t s  o r  ﬂ anking, and you are immune to weapon damage. You cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and you cannot grapple an opponent. You are immune to any spell or effect that targets a speci ﬁ c number of creatures, except for mind-affect-ing spells and abilities. You take half a g a i n  a s  m u c h  d a m a g e  ( + 5 0 % )  f r o m  spells or effects that affect an area. U n l i k e  o t h e r  s w a r m s  o f  D i m i n u t i v e  creatures, you are not vulnerable to wind effects. If reduced to 0 hit points or less, or rendered unconscious by nonlethal damage, you instantly return to your normal form in a square of your choice that was formerly covered by the swarm. —Swarm Attack: You gain a swarm attack that deals 4d6 points of damage to any creature whose space you occupy at the end of your turn. Your swarm attack strikes as a magic weapon of your alignment. 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   132 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   132 9/15/04   3:07:08 PM 9/15/04   3:07:08 PM133CHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONS —Distraction: Any living creature vulnerable to your swarm attack that begins its turn in a square occupied by your swarm must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of your swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). —Possessions:  A l l  o f  y o u r  w o r n  o r carried equipment and items become nonfunctional, absorbed into your new form. You can take only move actions (so you cannot use other invocations) while under the effect of dark discor- poration. DARK FORESIGHT Dark; 9th You can use foresight  as the spell with this invocation. If you are within 100 f e e t  o f  a n d  h a v e  l i n e  o f  s i g h t  t o  t h e  target of the ability, you can commu-nicate telepathically with the target. DARK ONE’S OWN LUCK Least; 2nd You are favored by the dark powers if you have this invocation. You gain a luck bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) on Fortitude saves, Reﬂ ex saves, or Will saves (your choice each time you use this ability) for a period of 24 hours. You can ’t apply this ability to two different save types at the same time. This bonus can never exceed your class level. DARKNESS Least; 2nd You can use darkness  as the spell. THE DEAD WALK Lesser; 4th You can turn the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies (as the animate dead  spell). Unless you include the normal mate-rial component for the spell (an onyx gem worth 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead) as part of the process, undead created by this ability crumble into dust after 1 minute per caster level.DEVIL’S SIGHT Least; 2nd You gain the visual acuity of a devil for 24 hours. You can see normally in darkness and magical darkness out to 30 feet. DEVOUR MAGIC Greater; 6th This invocation allows you to deliver a targeted greater dispel magic  with your touch. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each spell level dispelled by this touch. For example, if you success-fully dispel a wall of ice,  you gain 20 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points fade after 1 minute and do not stack with other temporary hit points. If you devour a new spell, you can replace the old temporary hit points with the ones gained from the more recent spell, thus resetting the duration. You cannot devour your own invocations. EARTHEN GRASP Least; 2nd You can use earthen grasp  as the spell (see page 104). ELDRITCH CHAIN Lesser; 4th; Blast Shape This blast shape invocation allows you to improve your eldritch blast  by turning it into an arc of energy that “jumps ” from the ﬁ rst target to others. An eldritch chain  can jump to one or more secondary targets within 30 feet of the ﬁ rst target, allowing you to make additional ranged touch attacks and deal damage to the secondary targets if you hit. You can “jump ” the chain to one secondary target per ﬁ ve caster levels, so you can strike two additional targets at 10th level, three additional targets at 15th level, and four additional targets at 20th level. Each new target must be within 30 feet of the previous one, and you can ’t target the same creature more than once with the eldritch chain.  If you miss any target in the chain, the eldritch chain  attack ends there.  E a c h  t a r g e t  s t r u c k  a f t e r  t h e  ﬁ rst takes half the damage dealt to the ﬁ rst target. This reduction in damage to secondary targets applies to any effect that increases the damage of your eldritch blast  (such as vitriolic blast ). You must make a separate spell penetration check for each target, if applicable. ELDRITCH CONE Greater; 5th; Blast Shape This blast shape invocation allows you to invoke your eldritch blast  as a 30-foot cone. The eldritch cone  deals the normal eldritch blast  damage to all targets within the area. This is not a ray attack, so it requires no ranged touch attack. Any creature in the area of the cone can attempt a Re ﬂ ex save for half damage. ELDRITCH DOOM Dark; 8th; Blast Shape This blast shape invocation allows you to invoke your eldritch blast  as the dreaded eldritch doom . This causes bolts of mystical power to lash out and savage nearby targets. An eldritch doom  deals eldritch blast  damage to any number of targets designated by you and within 20 feet. This is not a ray attack, so it requires no ranged touch attack. Each target can attempt a Re ﬂ ex save for half damage. ELDRITCH SPEAR Least; 2nd; Blast Shape This blast shape invocation extends your eldritch blast  attacks to great distances. Eldritch spear  increases the range of an eldritch blast  attack to 250 feet with no range increment. ENERVATING SHADOW Greater; 5th The dark powers cloak you and shield you from harm while draining vitality from nearby foes. This invoca-tion grants you total concealment in any area that isn ’t brightly lit (it will not work in daylight or in the radius of a spell with the light descriptor). In addition, any living creature adjacent to you with this ability active must make a Fortitude save at the beginning of its 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   133 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   133 9/15/04   3:07:10 PM 9/15/04   3:07:10 PM134 CHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONSturn or take a –4 penalty to Strength for 5 rounds. Once a creature is affected by enervating shadow,  it cannot be affected again by your enervating shadow  for 24 hours. The duration of this ability is 5 rounds, and it can be countered or dispelled by any light spell or effect of equal or higher level. ENTROPIC WARDING Least; 2nd When this invocation is activated, chaotic energies swirl about you, deﬂ ecting incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks (as entropic shield ). You leave no trail (as pass without trace ) and cannot be tracked by scent. (You can still be detected normally by scent, just not tracked.) FELL FLIGHT Lesser; 3rd When you use this invocation, the powers of darkness bear you aloft as you sprout a streaming, winglike cape of shadows. You can ﬂ y at a speed equal to your land speed with good maneu- verability for 24 hours. FLEE THE SCENE Lesser; 4th You can use dimension door  as a spell-like ability, although the range is limited to short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). When you use this ability, you leave behind a major image  of yourself in your place that lasts for 1 round. The image reacts appropriately to attacks as if you were concentrating on it. FRIGHTFUL BLAST Least; 2nd; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast  into a frightful blast . Any creature struck by a frightful blast  must succeed on a Will save or become shaken for 1 minute. A shaken creature struck by a frightful blast  i s  n o t  aff e c t e d  b y  th e shaken aspect of the blast but takes damage normally. Creatures with immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities or fear effects cannot be shaken by a frightful blast .HELLRIME BLAST Lesser; 4th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a hellrime blast . A hellrime blast  deals cold damage. Any creature struck by the attack must make a Fortitude save or take a –4 penalty to Dexterity for 10 minutes. The Dexterity penalties from multiple hellrime blasts  do not stack. HIDEOUS BLOW Least; 1st; Blast Shape As a standard action, you can make a single melee attack. If you hit, the target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast  (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast). This damage is in addition to any weapon damage that you deal with your attack, although you need not deal damage with this attack to trigger the eldritch blast  effect. HUNGRY DARKNESS Lesser; 3rd You can create an area of shadow (as the darkness  s p e l l )  t h a t  i s  ﬁ lled with bats (as the bat swarm, page 237 of the Monster Manual,  except the swarm ﬁ lls every square occupied by the darkness). The hungry darkness  is stationary. You are immune to the attacks of your own hungry darkness,  but you are still subject to the effect of the darkness. The hungry darkness  remains as long as you con- centrate on it (like concentrating on a spell), plus 2 rounds thereafter. If the bat swarm is destroyed, the darkness disappears as well. LEAPS AND BOUNDS Least; 2nd You invoke this ability to gain amaz- ing agility. You gain a +6 bonus on Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks for 24 hours. MIASMIC CLOUD Least; 1st A misty cloud of fog spreads in a 10-foot radius from you when you use this invocation. The fog does not block line of sight, but all creatures in the fog have concealment. Any creature (other than you) that enters the fog must make a Fortitude save or become f a t i g u e d .  T h i s  e f f e c t  l a s t s  a s  l o n g  a s  the creature remains within the cloud and for 1 round thereafter. A moderate wind, or any ﬁ r e  lar g e r  th an  a  t o r ch , immediately disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts for 1 minute.Illus. by M. Moore 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   134 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   134 9/15/04   3:07:12 PM 9/15/04   3:07:12 PM135CHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONSNOXIOUS BLAST Greater; 6th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a noxious blast . Any creature struck by a noxious blast  must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 minute. PATH OF SHADOW Dark; 6th This invocation allows you to use shadow walk  a s  t h e  s p e l l .  E a c h  h o u r that you spend shadow walking with this ability, you regain hit points as if you had rested for a full day. REPELLING BLAST Greater; 6th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a repelling blast . Any Medium or smaller creature struck by a repelling blast  m u s t  m a k e  a  R e ﬂ e x  s a v e  o r  b e hurled 1d6 ×5 feet (1d6 squares) directly away from you and knocked prone by the energy of the attack. If the creature strikes a solid object, it stops prematurely, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet hurled, and it is still knocked prone. Movement from this blast does not provoke attacks of opportunity. RETRIBUTIVE INVISIBILITY Dark; 6th You can use greater invisibility  as the spell, but you can target only yourself with the invocation. If your retributive invisibility  is dispelled, a shock wave releases from y our body in a 20-foot - radius burst. This shock wave deals 4d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stuns them for 1 round (a Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect). SEE THE UNSEEN Least; 2nd When you use this invocation, you can activate great powers of vision, allowing you to see invisible creatures and objects (as see invisibility ). You also gain darkvision out to 60 feet for a period of 24 hours. SICKENING BLAST Least; 2nd; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation a l l o w s  y o u  t o  c h a n g e  y o u r  eldritch blast  into a sickening blast . Any living creature struck by a sickening blast  must make a Fortitude save or become sick- ened for 1 minute. A sickened creature struck by a second sickening blast  is not affected by the sickening aspect of the blast but still takes damage normally. SPIDERWALK Least; 2nd You can grant yourself the ability to spider climb  (as the spell) with a duration of 24 hours. While this invocation is in effect, you are unaffected by webs (either mundane or magical). STONY GRASP Lesser; 3rd You can use stony grasp  (see page 124) as the spell. SUMMON SWARM Least; 2nd You can use summon swarm  as the spell with this invocation. Unlike the spell, this invocation has a duration of concentration instead of concentration + 2 rounds. TENACIOUS PLAGUE Greater; 6th You can use this invocation to sum-mon a swarm, as the insect plague  spell. You add your Charisma modi ﬁ er to the Fortitude save DC to resist the swarm ’s distraction ability. The attacks of any locust swarm summoned by this ability are treated as magic weapons for the pur- pose of overcoming damage reduction. UTTERDARK BLAST Dark; 8th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence in- vocation allows you to change your eldritch blast  into an ut- terdark blast . An utterdark blast  deals negative energy damage, which heals undead creatures instead of damaging them (much like inﬂ ict spells). Any creature struck by the attack must make a For- titude save or gain two negative levels. The negative levels fade after 1 hour. If a target ever has as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies.Eldritch chain 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   135 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   135 9/15/04   3:07:20 PM 9/15/04   3:07:20 PM136 CHAPTER 4 SPELLS  AND INVOCATIONSVITRIOLIC BLAST Greater; 6th; Eldritch Essence This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a vitriolic blast . A vitriolic blast  deals acid damage, and it is formed from c o n j u r e d  a c i d ,  m a k i n g  i t  d i f f e r e n t from other eldritch essences because it ignores spell resistance. Creatures struck by a vitriolic blast  automatically take an extra 2d6 points of acid damage on following rounds. This acid damage persists for 1 round per ﬁ ve class levels you have. For example, a 15th-level war- lock deals 2d6 points of acid damage per round for 3 rounds after the initial vitriolic blast  attack. VOIDSENSE Lesser; 4th You can sharpen your hearing and sight when you use this invocation, gaining blindsense out to 30 feet for 24 hours. VORACIOUS DISPELLING Lesser; 4th You can use dispel magic  as the spell. Any creature with an active spell effect dispelled by this invocation takes 1 point of damage per level of the spell effect (no save). WALK UNSEEN Lesser; 2nd You gain the ability to fade from view. You can use invisibility  (self only), except the duration is 24 hours. WALL OF GLOOM Lesser; 2nd You can use wall of gloom  (see page 129) as the spell.WALL OF PERILOUS FLAME Greater; 5th You can conjure a wall of ﬁ re as the spell with this invocation. Half the wall ’s ﬁ re damage results from super- natural power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to ﬁ re. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points or lower by a wall of peril- ous ﬂ ame,  its remains are completely consumed 1 round later (as if by a destruction  spell). WARLOCK’S CALL Greater; 5th You can use this invocation to send a message as the sending  spell. However, Morthos summons a swarm of batsa creature unwilling to reply to you can attempt a Will save to turn the sending back on you, dealing 1d10 points of damage to you. WORD OF CHANGING Dark; 5th You utter a powerful word that trans- forms a creature into an inoffensive form. This effect functions like the baleful polymorph  spell , except that 24 hours after being transformed, the subject is entitled to a second saving throw (at its original save bonus) to spontaneously resume its normal form. If this second save fails, it remains in its new form permanently or until restored by some other means.Illus. by E. Fiegenschuh 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   136 620_17925_Chpt4.indd   136 9/15/04   3:07:25 PM 9/15/04   3:07:25 PMof experimentation, have found that a tiny swallow of enchanted brew is the best and easiest way to make a one-use effect usable by anybody, without requiring any magical training or skill. Crafting an item in an alternate form thus requires that a spellcaster possess both the standard creation feat for the item’s original form and the Craft Wondrous Item feat, both used in conjunction to allow the creation of variant potions or scrolls while maintaining the beneﬁ  ts of potion and scroll creation pricing. While it’s possible to introduce new item creation feats into a game, so long as new forms of existing magic items follow all the rules for use as their original forms, new rules shouldn’t be required. A potion in the shape of a tile you snap to activate is mechanically identical to a potion you drink—you need no special magical training to use it, its magic is used up by the activation, and using it is a moderately distracting physical task that provokes attacks of opportunity from any nearby foes. The tile might be slightly more useful in some situ-ations (underwater, for instance, or in the hands of a creature that has no way to ingest the contents of a potion vial), but the difference is too minor to justify the existence of a Craft Magic Tile feat. Tiles and potions both ﬁ  ll the same game niche.rcane spellcasters rarely achieve any degree of com- petence without learning how to make good use of the second set of weapons and tools in the arcanist’s repertoire—magic items. Spells are powerful and ﬂ exible, but magic items can provide persistent or conve- nient magical effects that would require more spell power than a sorcerer or wizard might care to part with. Casting cat’s grace  over and over again wastes valuable spell slots, but any character with the wealth or luck will discover that gloves of Dexterity  are a much better way to gain the spell’s beneﬁ  t on a lasting basis. ALTERNATE ITEM TYPES Everyone knows that potions are peculiar magical con- c o c ti o n s  th a t  c o m e  in  tin y  vi als ,  s c r o lls  ar e  l o n g  r o lls  o f  parchment covered with strange symbols of power, and wands are slender sticks that can deal magical mayhem on command. However, in the creation and use of magic items, form follows function, and there’s no reason that potions or scrolls can’t be created in less conventional forms so long as they still function in the same manner as their standard forms. Creating a magic item in an alternate form is generally not as efﬁ  cient as using the standard design. Potions are created as small cordials because spellcasters, over centuries 137Illus. by M. Cavotta Illus. by M. Cavotta 620_17925_Chpt5.indd   137 620_17925_Chpt5.indd   137 9/15/04   11:25:50 AM 9/15/04   11:25:50 AM138 CHAPTER 5 MAGIC ITEMS Alternative magic item forms are a good way to add ﬂ  avor and mystery to your campaign. If one culture is known to craft magic tiles instead of potions, foes from that culture will be distinct from other opponents. After the ﬁ  rst instance in which player characters encounter NPCs who use tiles to obtain combat bene ﬁ ts, they will come to recognize such items as the tools of a particular nation or foe. ( “Look, that assassin was carrying Abkathian potion-tiles. The Abkathians must be behind this! ”) Be careful not to overdo this sort of variant material, though —the classic forms are classic for a reason, and if your players end up with no idea what forms magic items in your campaign might take, they could spend more time worrying about that than they do enjoying the game. POTIONS The standard potion is, of course, a vial ﬁ lled with a magical libation, designed to be consumed by anyone and having the following characteristics. • Single-use only —once consumed, the potion is gone. • Limited to spells of 3rd level or lower. • No special magical training required —anyone can drink a potion and gain the bene ﬁ t of its magic. • Must be physically manipulated in some way (unstoppered or broken, then consumed). • Must be in the user ’s hand to be used. • Use provokes attacks of opportunity. Within these broad guide- lines, though, a number of alternate potion forms might be possible.",

        "description":  "A spell is held in a small, complex weave of precisely tied knots. The user pulls apart the knotted square by choosing the right strands while speaking the spell ’s activation words. When a scroll is found in the course of a campaign, deci-phering its magical text is usually the ﬁ rst step to using it, but since variant scroll forms that don ’t have spells stored in written form can ’t be deciphered with read magic , they must be identi ﬁ ed with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). NEW TYPES OF ITEMS The basic types of magic items described in the Dungeon Master ’s Guide —armor, weapons, potions, scrolls, rods, rings, staffs, wands, and wondrous items —are not neces- sarily the only types of magic item possible. In Faer ûn, the world of the F ORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign setting, magic tattoos, magic runes, and contingent spells are common magic items, each crafted in the same manner as a standard magic item and requiring its own unique item creation feat (Tattoo Magic, Inscribe Rune, and Craft Contingent Spell). Rune magic is described in the F ORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign Setting , magic tattoos are described in Races of Faer ûn, and contingent spells appear in the Unapproachable East  source- book (and are included in Complete Arcane  for use in any D\u0026D campaign). When is a variant form of an item different enough from the basic form to warrant an item creation feat and item type of its own? In simplest terms, whenever one of the essential game rules about making or using the item is changed. All three of the item types mentioned above are fairly similar to potions (each is a one-use magic item that can be used by anyone, regardless of magical training or aptitude), but each device alters one of the essential characteristics of potions. For example, it takes only 10 minutes to inscribe a magic rune, and runes can be made into simple magic traps. A tattoo takes 1 hour to scribe, and doesn ’t provoke attacks of opportunity when activated. Contingent spells can be set to take effect automatically, with no additional action on the bearer ’s part. All of these differences change the items ’ characteristics enough that they cannot be reproduced by the Brew Potion feat, and so new item creation feats are warranted for them. CONTINGENT SPELLS A contingent spell is a single-use, one-spell magical effect instilled within a speci ﬁ c willing creature. It doesn ’t take up space on the body or have a physical form, and it remains inactive until triggered (similar to the effect created by a contingency  spell). Once triggered, a contingent spell takes immediate effect upon the bearer (or is centered in the bearer ’s square if the spell affects an area). A character must have the Craft Contingent Spell feat (see page 77) to create contingent spells. Triggers for contingent spells are usually events that happen to the bearer of the spell, and can include death, contracting disease, exposure to a breath weapon or to energy damage, falling, exposure to poison, exposure to a dangerous environment (trapped by ﬁ re, plunged underwater, and so forth), succumbing to sleep or fear effects, gaining negative levels, or being rendered helpless, deafened, or blinded. The market price of a contingent spell is spell level × caster level × 100 gp. A contingent spell must be prepared in the presence of the person to bear it, and the bearer is subject to the same restrictions as the creator (unable to cast any other spells while the contingent spell is being prepared, must be present for 8 hours each day, and so on). Once assigned to a bearer, a contingent spell cannot be transferred to another creature, although it can be destroyed (see below). A contin- gent spell is tied to the bearer ’s body, alive or dead, and stories circulate among adventurers of contingent spells remaining quiet for hundreds of years on a slain bearer ’s remains, only to suddenly activate when the proper trigger condition arises. If the bearer of a contingent spell is the target of dispel magic , the contingent spell might be permanently dispelled (but not triggered), as if it were an active spell in effect on the target creature. In an antimagic ﬁ eld, contingent spells are temporarily suppressed as all other magic items are. At any one time, a creature can bear a number of contingent spells equal to its Hit Dice. Attempts to apply additional contingent spells beyond this limit simply fail. SPELLBOOKS Although most folks think of them as thick, heavy tomes of parchment or vellum pages bound with ornate covers and heavy locks, a wizard ’s spellbooks can take almost any form. A spellbook can be made from belts of linked metal plates that serve as pages, scribed on thin sheets of ivory, or disguised by magic to look like a shield, gaming board, lute, or almost any other mundane item of equivalent size. Whatever their appearance, spellbooks are generally classi- ﬁ ed in two groups —arcanabula and grimoires. Arcanabula, or workbooks, are a wizard ’s everyday working tomes. They tend to contain spells jumbled in any order, interspersed with annotations and notes of magical lore, and are often stained and battered from travel and use in the ﬁ eld. Grimoires, sometimes called greatbooks, are formal, ordered collections of spells. Greatbooks tend to be locked, guarded, and hidden, either in a secure cache or in a wizard ’s abode. Most are composed with gilded ornamentation or inks, and they might even have plates of polished ivory or platinum within them, engraved or stamped with arcane writings. They are usually large and often of unusual proportions (such as very tall for their width), and many have metal-bound corners (ornate protective caps) and chased or relief-carved covers. 620_17925_Chpt5.indd   139 620_17925_Chpt5.indd   139 9/15/04   11:26:05 AM 9/15/04   11:26:05 AM140 CHAPTER 5 MAGIC ITEMSUSING SPELLBOOKS Every wizard possesses a personal set of notations, formulas, scripts, and ciphers for recording the workings of a spell. While the underlying language and concepts are the same, no wizard can simply pick up another ’s spellbook and instantly prepare spells from the foreign tome. Whenever an attempt is made to understand another wizard ’s spellbook (including forgotten tomes discovered in ruined towers or traveling workbooks seized from the hoards of enemies), the reader must employ read magic  or succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level) to identify a particular spell (and its general purpose, if the spell is one not known to the reader). Until a wizard deciphers a spell in a foreign book, its magic is useless. Wizards can prepare spells from a foreign spellbook or copy spells from a foreign spellbook into their own as described in Arcane Magical Writings, page 178 of the Player ’s Hand- book . Two special circumstances, discussed below, are worth noting.",

The rest of this chapter presents a number of new magic items, along with items revised from previous supplements, that might be of particular value to arcane characters —or the foes that oppose them. Basic information for all the abilities and items described here can be found in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide . NEW SPECIAL MATERIAL Members of the Green Star adept prestige class (see page 41) rely on a precious substance called starmetal to gain their distinc- tive abilities. Starmetal can also be used in the creation of weapons that are potent against crea- tures not native to the M a t e r i a l  P l a n e ,  o r  t h e manufacture of armor of similar quality to t h a t  m a d e  f r o m  a d a - mantine.",

Starmetal also possesses an inherent magi- cal connection to the Material Plane, meaning that weapons made of the alloy are especially effective against creatures from other planes. Weapons made of starmetal deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to any extraplanar creatures while they are on the Material Plane.

The wearer becomes cognizant of all spellcasting that occurs within 60 feet, and she can identify the spell being cast (even if she can ’t see its casting or effect) on a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If this identi ﬁ cation succeeds, the wearer can choose once per day to have the ring counterspell (without readying a counterspell action or making a dispel check) or can change the target or the point of effect of the spell to any target or point within 60 feet (including herself if she chooses to redirect a potentially bene ﬁ cial spell). If the wearer chooses an illegal target (an animal for a humanoid-affecting spell, for instance, or a point of effect outside the spell ’s range as measured from the original caster), the spell functions normally and the redirection is wasted.

Theurgy: Often carved from a single piece of polished coral, a ring of theurgy  functions differently depending on which type of arcane spellcaster wears it. For wizards and other characters who prepare spells, the ring serves as a small and quickly accessible spellbook capable of storing up to three spells of any level the wearer can cast. As a move action, the wearer can transfer any spell in the r i n g  t o  a n  e m p t y  s p e l l slot of the appropriate level, with the spell instantly ready to be c a s t  a s  i f  p r e v i o u s l y  prepared. The wearer can’t transfer a spell from a ring of theurgy to an expended spell slot, but only to a spell slot that he deliberately left empty in order to prepare a spell, providing some degree of spontane-ity in the spells he has available even though he gains no additional spells per day. For example, a 5th-level wizard might store ﬁ reball , dispel magic , and ﬂ y in the ring, then leave one 3rd-level spell slot open to be used for offense, defense, or escape as necessary. Sorcerers and other characters who don ’t prepare spells gain a different bene ﬁ t from a ring of theurgy.  Each spell stored in the ring is usable as an additional spell known as long as the character has an unused spell slot of the appropriate level. The stored spell disappears from the ring when cast, but the wearer can then have spells not on her spell list cast into the ring to be used again. For example, a bard who doesn ’t have invisibility sphere  on her list of spells known could have the spell put into a ring of theurgy  by her party ’s wizard so that both characters have the spell available if needed. Any material components or XP components are provided at the time the spell is cast from the ring, not at the time it is put into the ring to be stored for later retrieval.

They draw no conclusions of their own and follow orders explicitly with no regard for their own safety. The commands given them must be simple, such as “Remain here and attack any elves who enter this room,” or “Follow and defend against any who attack my party.” An efﬁ  gy’s creator can command it if the efﬁ  gy is within 60 feet and can see and hear him. If uncom- manded, an efﬁ  gy usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, but it will defend itself if attacked. An efﬁ  gy’s creator can order the creature to obey the orders of another individual (who can in turn order the efﬁ  gy to obey someone else), but the efﬁ  gy’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the efﬁ  gy to obey him alone. Damaged efﬁ  gi es can be r epair ed b y m eans o f any repair spell (see Chapter 4) or by manual repair in an appropriate workshop or laboratory. The individual performing the repairs must have the Craft Construct feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual ) or 10 ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), and must spend 50 gp and 1 hour per hit point restored.onsters of bizarre nature and arcane power often go hand in hand, for the magic that high-level arcanists wield can summon outsiders from distant planes, build construct mockeries of living creatures, or modify mundane creatures in ways far beyond the will of nature. Some creatures with a magical essence of their own are drawn to arcane power, often hoping to feed on a spellcaster ’s magic or intent on destroying those who wield magic as a weapon. EFFIGY CREATURE Efﬁ gies are magically animated automatons built in the form other living creatures. They are things of clockwork mechanisms and alchemy, animated by an elemental spirit bound to their mechanical shells. Magical arti ﬁ cers and artisans capable of creating such complex devices are few and far between, so ef ﬁ gies are not at all common. Unlike with most constructs, an ef ﬁ gy creature ’s true nature is not always immediately obvious. Some are quite lifelike, revealing their true nature only after taking seri-ous damage. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice that the ef ﬁ gy is an automaton, not a living creature of its type. 151Illus. by M. Cavotta Illus. by M.

This spell object ’s origins lie in the grue ’s own magical beginning, and is the only thing that remains of the creature if it is slain. See the individual elemental grue descriptions for details. All four types of grues can be summoned by means of a summon monster IV spell (the spell acquires the evil descriptor when so used). Note that summoned creatures return to their home planes if killed on the Material Plane, so a summoned elemental grue slain on the Material Plane leaves no spell object behind. COMBAT Each type of grue has its own unique combat abilities and tactics, but all share some qualities. An elemental grue ’s natural attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Spell Disruption (Su): The very presence of an elemental grue interferes with spells that affect the grue ’s associated element. Any spellcaster within 40 feet of a chaggrin who casts a spell with the same descriptor as the grue ’s element (earth, ﬁ re, air, or water) must succeed on a DC 15 caster level check or have the spell fail. Within the same area of any such spell currently in effect, a grue has a chance to dispel the effect as a free action, as if casting a targeted dispel magic (caster level 10th).

When a bard of great skill sings her songs in the common room of the village inn, her listeners enjoy for a short time entertainment ﬁ  t for a king—an hour or two of dreams and splendor in which even the lowest laborer can indulge. Of course, some bards also have reputations as thieves and liars, being all too quick to ﬂ  ee town leaving behind a string of false promises and broken hearts. Though the motives of such characters will a l w a y s  b e  q u e s t i o n e d ,  p e o p l e  k n o w  t h a t  e v e n  t h e  most blackhearted bard lacks the power to unleash magical plagues or other arcane devastation. Though people often fear magical power, they know that the bard’s brand of magic carries signiﬁ  cantly fewer risks to them than those of other arcanists.

In some cultures, nobles retain bards as advisors, entertainers, spymasters, and tutors to their children; these house bards, or hallsingers, often become permanent members of a noble’s household. In exchange for room, board, and a monthly retainer, a house bard serves as n most human cities and towns, the general populace is notoriously insensitive to the distinctions of training, skill, and talent that separate arcane spellcasters. The dif-ferences between a sorcerer and an enchanter, a warlock and a necromancer, or an evoker and a warmage are lost on such people, and any arcane spellcaster (other than the bard, who is generally easy to identify) is equally likely to be called mage, arcanist, sorcerer, enchanter, or wizard by someone without any real understanding of the character’s true skills. To most people, distinctions between types of arcane spellcaster matter only to arcanists themselves. Even in the most magical of settings, though, arcane spellcasters maintain a high social proﬁ  le. Few people in a busy trade town will mark the arrival or departure of a weathered sellsword or rakish fop, but the arrival of an arcanist of any description will be carefully noted and observed. BARDS Unless it’s by her own intent, a bard is never mistaken for another type of arcane spellcaster, and although the common folk might fear the sudden appearance of an unknown mage, the arrival of a new bard in town is often a cause for celebration. A bard’s skills promise new songs, new stories, and new music so powerful and magical that 163Illus. by M. Cavotta Illus. by M.

Just as a noble wins renown for the quality of the bard in his household, bards win renown for the elevation of their patrons, and to be the court bard of a high king is a great honor indeed. Bards with noble patrons can still spend much of their time adventuring, but they are expected to devote at least some of their efforts to advancing their patron ’s causes and to report back at regular intervals what they have heard and observed during their travels. In general, a bard with a patron must spend at least one week per month at the noble ’s residence, but after every few years of service, a bard is expected to forego travel for a time, spending several consecutive months in attendance at her lord ’s court. In addition to room and board, a house bard can expect a stipend of about 10 gp per month per character level (replac-ing the money an itinerant bard might earn through use of her Perform skill). On special occasions, such as when entertaining a visiting noble, a character ’s performance might be expected to earn her more. SORCERERS Like bards, sorcerers tend to attract attention, but (unlike bards) rarely of the positive kind. Where a wizard might hobble into town and seem little more than a weatherbeaten traveler, revealing his true nature only at his own discretion, a sorcerer tends not to remain anonymous for long, because his personal intensity and charisma draw the eye and linger in the memory. An inde ﬁ nable but tangible difference often separates the sorcerer from the rest of the world —and when difference is sown, suspicion often grows. Where a high noble might look to her court wizard for advice and scholarly insight into the doings of her rivals, sorcerers generally have little in the way of a wizard ’s formal education and training. Though most sorcerers rarely feel the need to ﬁ nd themselves a patron or to place themselves at a lord ’s disposal, those who do often ﬁ nd themselves regarded a s  m o r e  o f  a n  a r c a n e  w e a p o n  t h a n  a  f o u n t  o f  k n o w l e d g e , less suited to a roles as counselor and tutor than as an elite bodyguard or highly valued special agent. In the end, whether they are evil or good, most sorcerers simply choose to exist outside the normal circles of human society. Like elemental forces of nature, the most powerful sorcerers will never be directed, either by the concerns of the common folk or the commands of a king. WARLOCKS Even more so than sorcerers, warlocks tend to be viewed with great suspicion and fear, and only the most infamous necro-mancers come close to provoking the distrust and enmity that warlocks commonly elicit. Even the least superstitious know that a warlock ’s power is derived from dangerous and evil patrons, and even a warlock whose worth has been proven time and again in the service of good might still be thought to have the potential for dark treachery. The warlock’s path is a lonely oneIllus. by R. Spencer 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   164 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   164 9/15/04   9:39:55 AM 9/15/04   9:39:55 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 165 Few towns or cities will long abide a known warlock in their midst —low-level warlocks often risk being assaulted by pitch- fork-wielding mobs. Warlocks of moderate power rarely need fear outright attack, but they might ﬁ nd themselves subject to a variety of hints (subtle or otherwise) that their presence is unwanted. High-level warlocks are generally considered far too dangerous to offend, but they can often ﬁ nd themselves subject to harassment of a different sort as successive waves of crusading adventurers show up on their doorsteps, each intent on eliminating such a clearly malevolent threat. W ar l ocks f ar e a li ttl e be tt e r w h e n un d e r th e p ro t ecti o n of a local lord, but few good-hearted nobles freely offer a warlock employment. The reputation of these fell arcanists is simply too black, and it takes a lord of exceptional wisdom and character to ignore a warlock ’s fearsome reputation and look into the heart of the person beneath the stereotype. Like the sorcerer, the warlock is valued far less for his counsel and knowledge than for his ability to wreak havoc against his foes, and those rare few who obtain a powerful patron likely serve as bodyguards or highly capable arcane warriors. Most warlocks never swear fealty to another indi-vidual, though, preferring to wield their unique power only in their own name. WARMAGES While warmages share many of the strengths and limitations of sorcerers, lords and commoners alike tend to hold them in much higher esteem, because warmages often occupy positions of power. In any land where warmages are found, most people have at least heard of the famous academies in which arcanists are trained for battle, and the common folk will recognize a warmage either as a true and courageous defender of her homeland or as a highly favored agent of the ruling power. These expectations might be misplaced, of course, but until a warmage demonstrates that she ’s not to be trusted, she can generally assume the friendship and cooperation of her people. After years of training at the crown ’s expense, a warmage is often expected to repay the investment made in her education through military service. Adventuring warmages have typi- cally completed their duty, and they are generally on detached status or have paid scutage (a tax to exempt themselves from military service) to avoid any additional obligation. In general, though, a warmage who enjoys signi ﬁ cant authority by virtue of her class and training will always be answerable to those who in turn have the authority to command her. A warmage can almost always ﬁ nd employment as an of ﬁ cer in a noble ’s guard, an agent of the crown, or a member of a local garrison. This employment provides the warmage with room and board as well as a small salary (usually 10 gp per character level per month). However, a warmage who accepts such a position is expected to spend at least half her time on duty, serving whatever authority or lord employs her. Special arrangements for discretionary and independent activity can be made, but in times of crisis the warmage is at the command of her overlord, and she ignores the call to duty at her peril.WIZARDS The ranks of wizards run the gamut from humble conjur-ers to ﬂ amboyant arcane overlords. While many high-level wizards can be as imposing as the most dreadful warlock or sorcerer, others might seem nothing more than old beggars or vagabonds under even the closest inspection. Most wizards ﬁ nd it easier to conceal their true calling than do warlocks or sorcerers, and more than a few take pains to avoid revealing their powers until it suits them. Wizards who don ’t bother to conceal their nature are generally treated with no small degree of caution, and even a reputation for being more rational and in control than members of the other arcane classes doesn ’t guarantee them a warm welcome in strange lands. To the suspicious, an evil wizard embodies the potential to set a town ablaze, enslave the lord and the garrison, or conjure up hordes of murderous demons with a wave of his hand (whether or not these acts are actually within the wizard ’s power). Even wizards known to be crusading agents of good or servants of law and order can ﬁ nd themselves confronted on occasion with a healthy measure of distrust, for it ’s well known that troubles of all sorts —monsters, intrigues, and magic both potent and sinister —are drawn to wizards like moths to ﬂ ame. Their formalized training and the respect their power engen- ders often enable wizards to ﬁ nd positions as advisors and mentors to lords and kings; most great nobles require a skilled mage to guard their household and themselves against the magical spying or outright assaults of rivals and enemies. Similarly, the wizard ’s knowledge of arcane phenomena and ancient secrets might prove crucial in undoing an infestation of monsters, a magical plague, or the arcane power behind an enemy ’s secret plots. In return, a wizard who ﬁ nds a noble patron obtains a place of safety where he can rest, study, and perform experiments under his lord ’s protection (and often at the lord ’s expense). Wizards with noble patrons are expected to devote at least some of their arcane efforts to the service of their patron ’s causes. In general, a wizard with a patron must spend at least one week per month at the noble ’s residence, but unless the wizard has speci ﬁ c business that takes him away, he is expected to be found somewhere in his lord ’s realm rather than traveling abroad. House wizards are usually allowed to take sabbaticals on request, but a wizard who isn ’t around when his noble patron needs him might return to ﬁ nd that patron seeking (or already having hired) a replacement. In addition to room, board, and facilities suitable for a labo- ratory or library (from which he might be asked to perform research or create speci ﬁ c items on his lord ’s behalf), a house wizard can typically expect a personal stipend of at least 10 gp per month per character level, plus the defrayal of research expenses of at least 75 gp per month per character level. For example, an 8th-level wizard could expect to receive at least 80 gp per month for his personal use, plus at least 600 gp per month to maintain his laboratory, obtain special substances and spell components, compose spellbooks, perform magical research, engage in item creation, and otherwise look after his career. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   165 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   165 9/15/04   9:40:09 AM 9/15/04   9:40:09 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 166SPECIALIST WIZARDS T h o u g h  s p e c i ali s t  s p e ll c a s t e r s  t e n d  t o  b e  r e g ar d e d  s im p l y as wizards by the world at large (and treated accordingly), a distinction is frequently placed upon illusionists (prized for their ability to entertain), diviners (sought after for the secret information that is their stock in trade), and necromancers (feared for their sinister powers). Though specialist wizards all have the same general chance of obtaining patrons, a specialist ’s focus usually causes her to seek out opportunities geared toward her area of expertise. The various specialists are discussed below. Each section begins with a “point of view ” paragraph in italic type that summarizes how a member of that class might characterize himself and his specialty. ABJURERS Although it’s hardly a simple matter to wield the magic that will produce a blast of ﬁ  re or slay a giant with a word, the highest form of the mage’s art lies at the place where magic interacts with magic. To study the school of abjuration is to wield spells that manipulate the fabric of arcane power itself. Abjurers are deliberate, prudent, and thoughtful, possess- ing an unequaled determination and resolve that allows them to carefully consider all aspects of a problem before devising an ef ﬁ cient and effective response. They generally regard adherents of other schools of magic as reckless and wasteful, and they continuously evolve strategies for defeating other wizards in magic duels (whether such confrontations ever become necessary or not). Whether their lives are given over to adventuring or experimentation, abjurers are always well prepared. The study of abjuration requires a meticulous and delib-erate personality that generally favors a lawful alignment. Since abjuration often focuses on limiting the ability of others to do harm, many abjurers are inclined to walk the path of morality on the side of good. At the same time, the ruthless ef ﬁ ciency of abjuration used as a weapon against other spellcasters means that many wizards are drawn to the school by dreams of personal power that quickly override the orderly and benevolent philosophies of their fellows. Though abjurers are often reluctant adventurers, good a b j u r e r s  s o m e t i m e s  t ak e  u p  t h e  lif e  t o  u n d o  t h e  e vil  t h a t  magic too often spawns. Good and neutral abjurers tend to position themselves where they can prevent others from victimizing folk who lack the ability to defend themselves. Evil abjurers are often found as lieutenants or elite advisors to sinister overlords, selling their valuable skills to the highest bidder. Abjurers make their homes anywhere, but most prefer smaller towns to large cities. They generally enjoy the trust and good regard of their neighbors, and are sometimes willing to use their power on behalf of others with little thought of compensation or reward.CONJURERS The Material Plane is nothing but a small and unimportant crossroads in the cosmos. All that exists in this physical world is a mere reﬂ  ection of the iconic truths embodied in the unseen worlds that border it. Con ﬁ dent, headstrong, and opinionated, conjurers can often seem indolent and unconcerned with the dif ﬁ culties of others, rarely inclined to think their way around any obstacle or foe that can be more simply hammered down with the right application of summoned power. Because of the great control they wield over many dreadful extraplanar creatures, most conjurers view the other schools of magic with disdain —illu- sion and divination are trivial, transmutation and evocation are inconsequential, abjuration and enchantment are too weak, and necromancy is repulsive (possibly because, of all the schools, it alone can challenge the conjurer ’s sense of her own power). Conjurers must be strong-willed, decisive, and just a little bit reckless to excel in their chosen ﬁ eld, favoring chaotic alignments and preferring quick and decisive solutions over slower and more deliberate methods of problem-solving. Like necromancers, conjurers stare un ﬂ inching into the face of dark and powerful forces, and most rarely feel that they can afford the luxury of high (in other words, good) moral standards. As such, conjurers often favor evil and neutral alignments. Conjurers undergo adventures when the prospect of ﬁ nd- ing easy power and wealth seems to outweigh the risks and effort involved. They can be dif ﬁ cult companions, speaking their minds freely and having little patience for the opinions of those they consider inferior. It takes a leader of proven worth and unyielding strength to earn a conjurer ’s respect. In an adventuring group, conjurers prefer action to discussion, and tend to view overwhelming and immediate attack as the ﬁ rst step in any successful encounter. Most conjurers prefer to live in isolated frontier or wilder- ness areas, both because of their lack of interest in associating with those they deem beneath them (which is to say, most people) and as a means to practice the most dangerous aspects of their craft without worrying about the neighbors complaining (or being eaten). Aside from magical research, conjurers shun all activities that would normally constitute a career or an occupation, and when funds are low, they often simply summon creatures to fetch treasure for them. DIVINERS H i s t o r y  i s  f u l l  o f  m i s s e d  o p p o r t u n i t i e s ,  p e r s o n a l  t r a g e d i e s ,  a n d kingdom-shattering defeats that might easily have been averted but for a single piece of information that could have changed the course of lives and worlds. Knowledge is power, and those who know all hold ultimate power in their hands. Diviners are perhaps the wisest of all wizards. Like abjurers, they are often cautious and deliberate spellcasters, happy to avail themselves of every possible preparation and precaution before embarking on a hazardous course. For the diviner, 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   166 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   166 9/15/04   9:40:11 AM 9/15/04   9:40:11 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 167though, the best of all possible preparations is to choose the course of action that will avoid con ﬂ ict and peril altogether. While diviners aren ’t cowards (at least not all of them), few are likely to rush headlong into a ﬁ ght before every other option has been exhausted. Diviners are students not only of the arcane workings of spells and magical lore but also of the mechanisms of nature, the arts and sciences, and even human behavior. Few are better judges of character than diviners. In addition to being thoughtful and orderly in their affairs, diviners prize the quality of objectivity. A mind closed to any possibility (however remote or distasteful one may be) is a mind that might be closed to the truth, for the truth is not always simple or pleasant. Diviners are therefore strongly inclined toward neutral alignments, and usually favor law over chaos. Good diviners use their powers to anticipate and prevent harm to others; evil diviners use the knowledge they accumulate for their own gain. Diviners are not predisposed to the adventuring life, and many accept such a career only reluctantly . Still, with her judgment, cunning, and common sense, a diviner makes a valuable addition to most adventuring parties. In combat, though, diviners sometimes hesitate, overly conscious of the consequences of making the wrong choice when life and death are on the line. Diviners are loners at heart and do not make close friends easily. Even those who live in great cities tend to remain aloof and apart from their neighbors, avoiding interactions in the present to better study the past and the future. Although t h e y  s h o w  l i t t l e  i n t e r e s t  i n  m a t e r i a l  p o s s e s s i o n s ,  d i v i n e r s  often cover their research and living expenses by charging for their services as seers, fortunetellers, and ﬁ nders of lost objects and people. ENCHANTERS The mind is the ultimate power. Any fool can oppose an enemy by physical means, but to halt a foe through the sheer force of one ’s will—or to turn a most hateful enemy into a loyal ally —is the purest and most subtly effective manifestation of arcane might. Charismatic, sensitive, and passionate, enchanters tend to be personable and attractive, enjoying ﬁ ne arts and good conversation. Even the most blackhearted enchanter can be a mesmerizing individual —conﬁ dent, self-assured, and hold- ing others in thrall with manner and word even before the ﬁ rst syllables of his charm spell are uttered. Other enchanters are distant and clinical, viewing themselves as coldly rational students of the only subject worth studying —the mind. Enchanters have few predilections in alignment, though their belief that individual will is the strongest force in the multiverse slants them slightly toward chaos over law. Evil enchanters believe that those who lack the ability to overcome or resist the power of the mind deserve to be servants to that power, existing only to be commanded by those with the ability to do so. Good enchanters adopt the viewpoint that bending another being to one ’s will is rarely right, but is preferable by far to killing. A good enchanter deprives an enemy of his volition only as long as he needs to, and, when such is warranted, often takes pains to return the subject to his normal state in such a way as to avoid a traitor ’s punish- ment at the hands of his comrades or people. Enchanters are commonly the voice of reason in an adventuring party; they view physical combat as a last resort and work hard to devise options and solutions to problems that might otherwise elude their companions. Excellent team players, shrewd negotiators, and superb bargainers, enchanters favor frequenting, or living in, large towns and cities where they easily ﬁ nd many minds that they can study (or manipulate) with impunity. EVOKERS The universe is the interplay of impersonal forces —some spiritual, some political, some moral, some elemental, and some whose natures have yet to be revealed. Beneath the surface of the merely physical, fundamental energies form the true nature of all things. The school of evocation attracts the most serious-minded, intense, and determined wizards, devoted to the mastery of their craft to the exclusion of almost all else. Notable ascetics in their personal habits, evokers favor spartan surroundings, simple garb, and plain fare, eschewing clutter and luxury as distractions that deaden one ’s perceptions of the real world. In personality, evokers are decisive, forthright, and often stubborn. Good evokers perceive evil as an unbalancing force that must be opposed, while neutral or evil evokers tend to be heartless, seeing the trials and ordeals of mortals as the super ﬁ cial results of a larger unseen world at work. Good evokers undertake adventures in response to the currents and forces they perceive in the world, striving to respond when and where evil stirs. Evil evokers, not content to settle for reaction to the universal forces around them, seek to manipulate those forces, altering their ebb and ﬂ ow through their own actions. Regardless of alignment, evokers are natural leaders —fearless, inspiring, and authoritative. Among wizards, their courage on the battle ﬁ eld has no equal. Evokers prefer quiet and plain homes, seldom dwelling among large numbers of people. More than a few are hermits, choosing to live in the most rugged and forbidding natural sites. Common people leave evokers alone, fearing their power and the danger their reputation suggests —a reputation that many evokers do little to discourage. ILLUSIONISTS The universe is all in the mind that perceives it, and sensation is the ﬁ rst and only reality. If a tree falls in the forest with no creature to hear it, then there is no tree. Illusionists tend to be ﬂ amboyant, outgoing, and self- assured, many exhibiting a hedonistic streak that can lead to dark and cruel practices in the pursuit of rare and unusual perceptions. Remarkably creative, illusionists enjoy art, literature, poetry, and music, and many are accomplished art- ists in their own right. Although their aptitude for scholarly pursuits is as great as that of any other specialist, illusionists 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   167 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   167 9/15/04   9:40:12 AM 9/15/04   9:40:12 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 168spend less time in research than most, forgoing the isolation of the laboratory for the company of people and the constant thrill of manipulating the powers of sensation. Illusionists have sharp minds but are not particularly deep thinkers. Pragmatic by nature, they accept the impermanence of all things, and see only futility in the acts of those who dedicate their lives to the development of all-encompassing philosophies of existence and meaning. Illusionists have no strong alignment tendencies. While good illusion- ists share their creative impulses for the bene ﬁ t of others, evil illusionists sometimes take their worldview to dark extremes —the beings around them seem as less-than-real toys and tools to be manipulated or destroyed like any other ﬁ gment or shadow. An illusionist ’s forceful personality and sharp mind make her an equally g o o d  c h o i c e  f o r  l e a d e r  o r  r i g h t - h a n d strategist of an adventuring group. Like enchanters, illusionists know that their arts require an audience, and they enjoy the hustle and bustle of urban life, usually maintaining well-furnished homes in large and sophisticated cities. NECROMANCERS Life and death are one, for all living things die in time. Death is not an ending, but a begin-ning. Since one ’s living days are but a fraction of the eternal existence of death, life is but a useless distraction to the study and understanding of the long darkness to come. Brooding, humorless, and withdrawn, necromancers exhibit a fascination with life and death that borders on the obses- sive. Though casual acquaintances will often vi e w  th e m  as  c o l d  an d  h o s til e ,  th o s e  w h o  b e fri e n d  necromancers might come to know them as thought-ful, stoic, and loyal comrades. Most necromancers prefer solitude to companionship, though, and even the most trustworthy and valued among them can be prone to black spells of despondency during which they question the value of life and all things living. Continual exposure to the forces of death and undeath can have a corrupting effect on wizards who have even the slight- est inclination toward evil. Consequently, evil necromancers far outnumber good-aligned ones. Neutral necromancers are rare, since most necromancers either have a will strong enough to resist the lure of darkness, or they submit eventu-a l l y  t o  i t s  c o r r u p t i o n .  N e c r o m a n c e r s  h a v e  l i t t l e  t e n d e n c y toward either chaos or law; although a sense of order appeals to their clinical and meticulous nature, most necromancers are all too willing to turn their backs on the accepted norms of society in the pursuit of knowledge and power. Though necromancers are generally ill suited for leader- s hi p ,  s u ch  an  ar canis t  can  m ak e  a  v al ua b l e  a d di ti o n  t o  an adventuring group, both for the formidable power he wields and a familiarity with the dark forces of the world that makes him virtually fearless. On the other hand, a necromancer is slow to follow orders simply for their own sake, and one who disagrees with his comrades ’ strategy might strike out on his own at any time. Necromancers who are not adven- turers spend most of their time engaged in arcane research and writing, and since they have little need for the company of the living, they usually reside far from civi- lized regions, establishing homes in ancient castles, deep caverns, or even abandoned crypts. TRANSMUTERS Like a re ﬂ ection of the larger processes by which worlds are built and torn down once more, all life is change. Anything that has ceased to change, to grow, to e v o l v e  f r o m  w h a t  i t  w a s  c e a s e s  t o  b e  a part of the world, and the ultimate power is that which manipulates these forces of transmutation. Wizards drawn to the specialty of transmutation are typically curious, sharp- minded, and deeply analytical. Fascinated by the exercise of putting things together and taking them apart again, transmuters are natural tinkerers, often more interested in objects than in the creatures who create and wield them. With minds attuned more to ﬁ nding out how things work than to reasoning out why things are as they are, transmuters can be obsessive collectors, excellent scholars, and clear thinkers, but they aren ’t especially prone to profound philosophical insights. As a result of their focus on change and the forces that drive it, transmuters tend to see moral matters in terms of that change. Neutral and evil transmuters believe that good and evil are relative concepts, dependent on existing conditions and seldom permanent, and so they make little distinction between them. Good transmuters look past the universal constant of change to its effects on life, aspiring to ensure that change happens for the better. Regardless of their moral standing, transmuters favor chaotic alignments, for chaos is the essence of change. Eager to explore the world around them, transmuters are often eager members of adventuring groups, but in the role of loyal follower rather than reluctant leader, since they lack determination and rarely see the value in sticking to an inﬂ exible purpose.An illusionistIllus. by G. Kubic 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   168 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   168 9/15/04   9:40:14 AM 9/15/04   9:40:14 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 169 Transmuters are most comfortable in large cities, where they have access to the supplies, consultants, and other resources that their studies demand. In general, common folk are less distrustful of transmuters than they are of most other wizards; the lack of high-level destructive or control- ling capability in the magic of transmuters (notwithstanding the occasional baleful polymorph ) leads most commoners to consider them inspired but harmless eccentrics. WU JEN Neither peasant nor noble, a wu jen typically stands outside the traditional hierarchies of her homeland —her learning and personal power demand respect, but her lack of family standing and social graces sometimes make it dif ﬁ cult for the wealthy and powerful to accept her talents and skills. When adventuring in western lands, wu jen often ﬁ nd themselves forced to deal with both a general distrust of arcanists and a speci ﬁ c distrust of foreigners. For the most part (as with sorcerers and warlocks), the common folk do their best to stay out of a wu jen ’s way. At the same time, their strangeness can sometimes make it easier for wu jen to acquire patronage and position as advisors to lords and kings, since those nobles ’ preconceived notion of arcane magic causes them to see wu jen as shrouded in an air of exotic mystery and prestige. Though few noble clans in their native lands care to sully their standing by consorting with wu jen and their uncouth ways, exceptional wu jen sometimes prove themselves suf-ﬁ ciently to emerge as viziers or satraps under emperors and local lords. Some wu jen, in fact, have acquired tremendous political power by standing next to the throne of a ﬁ gurehead monarch who chooses (or is charmed ) not to contradict their dictates. THE DM AND THE ARCANE CAMPAIGN The best Dungeon Masters understand the capabilities of the characters in their game, and they look for ways in which every player ’s character has a chance to drive the action and direction of each adventure and the campaign as a whole. Handling arcane characters can be challenging in this regard, though, since mid- and high-level arcane spellcasters often have capabilities that might easily tip the balance of a typical game if they are not planned for. Adding to the challenge is the fact that arcane characters are sometimes sorely tempted to de ﬁ ne themselves not by their personalities, goals, and aims, but simply by their increasingly powerful arsenal of spells. This section of the chapter, addressing the DM directly, offers strategies and approaches that, in the situation described above, can make the game more workable, both for the player of an arcane character and the DM tasked with deﬁ ning that character ’s place in the game world.PACING THE ARCANE GAME Sorcerers, wizards, and other arcane spellcasters are unlike many other characters in the game, insofar as most require signi ﬁ cant regular downtime to make best use of their class features and feat choices. In the life of a ﬁ ghter or rogue, every day outside the dungeon tends to be much the same, and such characters ﬁ nd few things to do outside the context of adventur- ing (or at least few things that have any hard and fast connection to the pursuit of power, money, and experience). Many arcane characters, on the other hand, need time to use their item creation feats, perform spell research, or scribe new spells into spellbooks. When the characters ﬁ nd themselves buried under an onslaught of crises, invasions, plagues, and misfortunes against which they can ’t afford to take the occasional day off, the player of a wizard or sorcerer is being denied some of the most signi ﬁ cant features of the character ’s class. In general, a good rule of thumb is two days of time off for every day of adventuring in a campaign. If it takes the party six days to explore a particular ruin, you can hold off on the next a d v e n tur e  h oo k  f o r  tw e l v e  da y s  o f  cam pai gn  tim e .  F e e l  fr e e  to throw the PCs an occasional curveball (such as dropping the next adventure into their laps an hour after they leave the dungeon they were hoping to spend a couple of weeks recuperating from), but at the same time make sure they have some downtime, and that your players understand that their characters can take advantage of it to initiate projects at their convenience. The player of a high-level wizard who needs two months to create a magic item worth 60,000 gp should feel conﬁ dent that no disasters will strike partway through the adventuring hiatus to potentially ruin the character ’s efforts. Be careful, though, that introducing downtime into the campaign to avoid resentment from the players of arcane characters doesn ’t create a backlash of resentment from every- body else. You don ’t want your other players to feel as though their characters are being forced to cool their heels for weeks on end just so the wizard can hang out at the library or the lab. Though many campaigns don ’t bother making a big deal about it, the idea is that all characters (not just arcane casters) should spend a certain amount of time in training —honing their talents and learning new abilities as they advance in experience. If other characters don ’t have tasks of their own to occupy them, you can choose to allow them to train ahead of time for feats and skills that they will receive or improve at their next level while the arcane characters pursue their own interests (see How PCs Improve, page 197 of the Dungeon Master ’s Guide,  for more information). DESIGNING ADVENTURES FOR SPELLCASTERS Mages of any signi ﬁ cant level challenge the Dungeon Master like no other characters. Murder-mystery adventures rarely survive their ﬁ rst brush with detect thoughts  or vision.  Bot- tomless chasms are easily crossed with a simple 3rd-level ﬂ y spell, and teleportation makes in ﬁ ltrating the most sinister fortress child ’s play. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   169 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   169 9/15/04   9:40:17 AM 9/15/04   9:40:17 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 170 Finding new ways to challenge your players without resort- ing to capricious and arbitrary limitations on magical power can be a daunting task, and many DMs ﬁ nd themselves at one point or another treating the increasing capabilities of arcane spellcasters in their game as a trial to be overcome one spell at a time: monsters with blindsight and scent limiting the utility of invisibility;  villains wearing rings of mind shielding to ensure that PCs can ’t easily scry them; greater dispel magic suddenly becoming the only spell your NPC wizard villains know how to cast; and so on. This approach can too easily turn the campaign into an arcane arms race between the mages ’ capabilities and your own inventiveness. Even worse, it can trivialize the charac-ters’ accomplishments —if there ’s no advantage or bene ﬁ t to having labored long and hard to add teleport to a spell list, why bother trying? You have to allow arcane spellcasters to use their new abilities and let your game evolve accordingly as their power grows. S o m e  o f  t h e  m o s t  c o m m o n  “gamebusting ” capabilities that arcane characters acquire are charm magic, invisibility magic, ﬂ ying magic, scrying magic, and teleportation, each of which brings its own perils to the gaming table and requires a suitably creative response. Charms Charm magic is the ﬁ rst category of potentially problematic magic that most arcane characters acquire. Every captured villain is routinely subjected to interrogation after being charmed  by a player character bard or mage. While many players expect that any NPC enthralled by their character ’s charm person spell will naturally be happy to explain all aspects of the Big Plan to their newfound friend, there are a number of reasonable counters to this tactic. First off, not every opponent need be a humanoid NPC. A villain can have servants of other creature types —undead, giants, or monstrous humanoids, for example —that are safe from such interrogation until charm monster  becomes available, giving you a few levels of breathing room. A clever villain with humanoids in his employ might anticipate the capture and interrogation of his minions (whether by charm or more mundane means), and therefore carefully control the ﬂ ow of information in his organization. Especially devious foes count on the capture and charming  of a servant or two, and deliberately sow disinformation in the ranks of their followers so that any would-be heroes instead charge off into ambushes, deadly traps, or terribly embarrassing misunder-standings on the basis of the “guaranteed ” knowledge that the charmed  creature  has given them. The goal is not to completely prevent the acquisition of important information through charm spells, but to teach the players to treat charm-acquired information with a healthy dose of deliberation and second thought. That way, even in the event that the party does get dependable information from a captured creature, that knowledge has a smaller chance of derailing the game. Charm magic should be a useful tactic for the characters to consider rather than the perfect solution to every need for adventuring intelligence. Don ’t make your critical NPCs immune to charm magic, because your players will likely just ﬁ nd this frustrating. Likewise, don ’t place key information where it can be dis- covered only by of charming the right character at the right time. Instead, design adventures that offer useful (but not always earth-shaking) shortcuts and advantages to be gained f r o m  c h a r m - a c q u i r e d  k n o w l e d g e .  I f  a n  i m p o r t a n t  N P C  isn’t charmed,  the characters should be able to continue the adventure —but if they do succeed in charming her, perhaps they avoid a dif ﬁ cult encounter later on, or they gain an opportunity to strike their foes with surprise on their side. Flying The ability to take to the air has two major effects on play. It easily solves the problem of getting around or over obstacles such as chasms, rivers, and high walls, and it makes monsters without ranged attacks much less dangerous, since a ruthless party can simply attempt to exterminate such foes from the air without fear of retaliation. You can ’t do much to restrict access to ﬂ ying magic once player characters reach 5th or 6th level. If you want an obstacle to remain dif ﬁ cult or insurmountable even after t h i s  p o i n t ,  y o u r  b e s t  o p t i o n  i s  t o  d e s i g n  e n c o u n t e r s  a n d  challenges in such a way that the characters will be loath to expend the necessary spells or magic items to overcome that obstacle. The PCs can easily ﬂ y over the ﬁ rst chasm they encounter —but what if a second chasm awaits 15 minutes farther on, when the ﬂ ying spells they used to overcome the ﬁ rst obstacle are no longer in effect? The characters might still have the same capability to cross the second chasm as they had with the ﬁ rst—but now at the possible expense of a ﬁ reball  spell the sorcerer might need later. You don ’t want to design every obstacle this way, of course (just as you wouldn ’t want to prevent characters from using ﬂ y by having ev ery chasm under the effect of a permanent antimagic ﬁ eld), but try to keep ﬂ y an option that the players need to think carefully about, rather than one they use as a default solution to every transportation problem. For ﬂ ying PCs who choose to attack grounded foes, the simplest solution is to make sure those foes can shoot back. Killing orc axe ﬁ ghters from the air is easy enough, but orc archers or spellcasters pose a different challenge, and you can also include occasional encounters with ﬂ ying foes to neutralize the characters ’ advantage. At the same time, it ’s also good adventure design to create occasional encounters with a weakness that clever players can exploit. Giant vermin such as Huge scorpions might pose a deadly threat if attacked head on, so you can place a colony of them in an adventure with the expectation that the characters will use ﬂ ying magic to defeat them without taking losses. Invisibility Few spells are as highly coveted (or as subject to potential misuse) as invisibility . Invisibility serves two purposes in the 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   170 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   170 9/15/04   9:40:19 AM 9/15/04   9:40:19 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 171game —ﬁ rst as a spell for bypassing encounters and gather- ing intelligence, and second as a defensive spell that makes an affected character more dif ﬁ cult to hit. The simplest counter for invisibility is an enemy who ignores it —a crea- ture that has blindsight or one subject to a see invisibility  effect. Similarly, some special abilities (such as blindsense, tremorsense, and scent) limit the effectiveness of invisibility even though they don ’t negate it outright. NPC spellcasters might have scrolls or prepared spells such as glitter- dust, invisibil- ity purge, or see invisibil- ity. For that matter, any spellcaster with ac- cess to a summon monster spell will ﬁ nd numer- ous creatures on the summoning lists with the scent ability, providing a good offense against an invis-ible foe. Not every ad- venture should be designed to foil invisible characters, but any NPC who lives in expectation of attack by a hostile spellcaster ( which is to say , virtu- ally any thinking creature in a typical D\u0026D campaign) has likely given some thought to dealing with in- visible foes. Two human sentries set to guard a pas- sageway might be a signi ﬁ cant obstacle, but those same sen- tries provided with a well-trained dog consti- tute a much more formidable threat to invisible in ﬁ ltrators. Creatures with at least a modicum of slyness might place simple “traps, ” such as a stack of emp- ty pots behind a door —anyone opening the door knocks them over and makes a noticeable racket. An invisible character ’s footprints are easily seen as he moves across a sandy or muddy ﬂ oor (and bear in mind that in a typical D\u0026D fan- tasy environment, spotlessly clean ﬂ oors should hardly be the norm). In general, sophisticated foes with ac- cess to magic of their own are likely to understand the capabilities and limitations of invisibility and provide suitable ob- stacles. Shopkeepers in a good-sized city are certainly aware of the temptation their wares offer to low- level mages with invisibility  spells, and they will take steps (such as sim- ply locking up all but the most mun- dane merchandise) to prevent such theft. Slow-witted or prim- itive foes are more l i k e l y  t o  b e  c a u g h t off guard by invisible inﬁ ltrators —but not time after time. Even a band of ogres, once they realize that their foes are using invis-ibility to sneak up on them, will take steps to counter the tactic. Scrying The general category of scrying magic includes not only the scrying spell but also a number of related divinations, such as clairaudi- ence/clairvoyance , contact other plane , and discern location . On the most basic level, any time a character can cast a spell that might answer a question he otherwise wouldn ’t be able to answer based on the information at hand, he has an opportunity to derail the adventure. Scrying might not help a character storm a castle or explore the depths of a dungeon, but it ’s very likely to locate and identify the chief villains in any A wizard uses a ﬂ  y spellIllus. by W. O’Connor 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   171 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   171 9/15/04   9:40:20 AM 9/15/04   9:40:20 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 172plot, and it can solve otherwise challenging mysteries with a single easy casting. Of all the magical capability that a high-level spellcaster can bring to the table, scrying might be the most dif ﬁ cult for the Dungeon Master to deal with. The only foolproof defense against scrying is to pit magic against magic, relying on spells such as nondetection  or detect scrying in an attempt to ward off inquisitive heroes. The mundane precautions of sentries, dogs, and locked doors won ’t protect a villain ’s stronghold against scrying magic —but there ’s no reason a villain can ’t use spells to anticipate the arrival of trouble in the same way that characters might seek to avoid it. For example, an evil cleric might use a divination spell to ask if he will be the target of a scrying within the next week —and if so, by whom. Assuming the divination spell succeeds, the cleric could then take steps to defend against the scrying attempt. As with the defense against charmed interrogations, a clever and meticulous villain without access to divination-d e f e a t i n g  s p e l l s  m i g h t  a l s o  m a k e  a n  e f f o r t  t o  c o n t r o l  t h e information accessible to any particular minion, potentially limiting the damage of a thorough scrying effort. After all, if the lieutenant known to the heroes has no idea where the secret stronghold lies and has never met his leader face to face, no amount of scrying upon the lieutenant will ferret out the villain ’s secrets. A very clever foe will take steps to show her enemies what she wants them to see, planting false information where the characters ’ scrying attempts are sure to uncover it. As with charm spells, the best way to keep scrying spells from tipping the balance of the campaign is to design adventures that count on them. Build scenarios in which the characters are expected to use scrying magic to advance the plot and determine their next course of action. Anticipate the fact that the PC mage might attempt to cast scrying  on the mysterious red-haired monk who was seen near the king ’s chambers just before the king was killed, then design encounters appropriately. Scrying based on nothing more than that rough description might be the only clue available to characters trying to solve the murder, or it might be a false lead. The mysterious monk might have had nothing to do with the murder, or, even if he was the killer, might not have known who he was working for. Perhaps he was given instruc- tions to frame a lord who is loyal to the throne by ﬂ eeing to the house of the unsuspecting lord after the killing. Just like charm magic, scrying magic should be a helpful tool that sometimes provides unhelpful results, teaching characters to treat it as a step toward ﬁ nding the solutions to particular problems, not as a solution in and of itself. Teleportation More than most other types of magic, teleportation can allow a party of heroes to turn your most challenging adventures into so much dramatic Swiss cheese. Teleportation (often in conjunction with scrying magic or a charm  spell interroga- tion) is often used to skip past minions and defenders in order to get right to the chief villain, rendering your perfectly designed preliminary encounters useless. More signi ﬁ cantly, a party armed with teleportation magic is very hard to subject to any kind of mortal peril; one quick spell pulls everyone ’s bacon out of the ﬁ re as soon as things start to look bad. Without powerful magic or relatively arbitrary restrictions, teleporting PCs are extremely dif ﬁ c u l t  t o  h i n d e r  u n l e s s you can situate the occasional adventure in a place where teleportation is unreliable, such as a speci ﬁ c demiplane or in certain reaches of the deep underground. For example, the Underdark of Faer ûn, in the F ORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign setting, is characterized by the presence of faerzress , a magical radiation that hampers divination magic and teleportation magic. Every creature in an area affected by faerzress recives a +4 bonus on Will saves against all divination spells. The use of any teleportation spell in the Underdark requires a Spellcraft check (DC 35, or DC 25 for normally infallible methods such as greater teleport ), or a teleport mishap ensues. Certain spells such as forbiddance  and hallow can make small areas impossible to teleport into or out of. The spells anticipate teleportation  and greater anticipate teleportation  (see page 97) offer the protected creature a short period of warn-ing before a teleporting character or group arrives. As with other types of problematic magic, though, player characters have earned the right to use teleportation by the time they reach the appropriate level, and you shouldn ’t attempt to make every villain ’s stronghold immune to it as a standard feature of your adventure designs. Clever villains who lack access to thorough teleportation defenses can take other steps to limit the effectiveness of teleporting heroes. An evil cleric with a divination spell could easily anticipate the time of the heroes ’ arrival and set an ambush. Another villain might go to the trouble of building false throne rooms or lairs in the hopes of confusing her enemies, so that teleporting attackers might material-ize inside a deadly trap. As with scrying and charm magic, simply controlling information in the absence of elaborate p r e c a u t i o n s  i s  a  g o o d  s t e p  t o w a r d  p r e v e n t i n g  u n w a n t e d  visitors —locating and teleporting to the overlord ’s lair will be a great deal more challenging for the player characters if the villain ’s minions have no knowledge of the location or layout of that lair. WORLD BUILDING WITH MAGIC Just as you sculpt the physical topography and cultural geography of your campaign to create opportunities for adventure, you can shape the arcane makeup of your cam-paign in the same way. The exact nature of magic and the details of its workings are critical elements of any fantasy world. While the magic system of the D UNGEONS  \u0026 D RAGONS game answers many of these questions (What ’s the process for casting a spell? What can a spell do? How long does it take for characters to recover their magic?), many opportunities remain for building distinctive campaign features from the wealth of classes, prestige classes, feats, and spells available in the game. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   172 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   172 9/15/04   9:40:31 AM 9/15/04   9:40:31 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 173 For example, given the differences in each class ’s approach to arcane magic, consider how sorcerers and wizards might interact in a campaign. It ’s easy to imagine a setting in which wizard magic is “legal, ” sanctioned and approved by the powers of the land, while sorcery is considered reckless and dangerous. If the realm is basically a good kingdom, sorcer-ers might be viewed as agents of evil and chaos regardless of their actual alignment or allegiances. On the other hand, if the realm in question is an iron- ﬁ sted tyranny, sorcerers might be ﬁ erce freedom ﬁ ghters who represent the only path of arcane power open to the downtrodden common folk. You can also designate speci ﬁ c roles or responsibilities for certain prestige classes. The Initiates of the Sevenfold Veil (see page 44) could be an elite order of royal mageguards in the service of a great realm, or you might create the High Sagelords of Zeirr as a special council chosen from the ranks of proven loremasters. Alternatively, you might c h o o s e  t o  d e s i g n  y o u r  o w n  p r e s t i g e  c l a s s  to cover the campaign niche you have in mind. Cultural Inclinations In general, the D\u0026D game assumes that any character can do anything. Dwarves can be wizards, elves can be bards, half-orcs can be sorcerers. Some choices might make more sense t h a n  o t h e r s  f r o m  a  c u l t u r a l perspective, but the game puts no real restrictions on race or class choices. When building your own campaign world, you can modify this principle to suit your own needs. Magic by its nature is exclusive and incomplete, so the bloodlines necessary to master sorcery might exist only in a few families, just as the lore of the wild mage might be taught only in one speci ﬁ c arcane college, and warlocks might arise only among the people of a certain tribe or nation. Your own sense of how the magic of the campaign works should never be forced on player characters, for while many players will naturally want to create characters who ﬁ t well in the world of the cam- paign, any character a player imagines is by its very nature exceptional. Players have the privilege of creating unique and hard-to-explain characters. For example, if the human Telziijka tribesfolk are the only known warlocks in your campaign, and a player wants to play a dwarf warlock, you and the player should be able to come up with a means to accommodate that desire (the dwarf character might have been raised among the Telziijka, perhaps, learning their customs and traditions). Alternatively, the unique component of Telziijka heritage responsible for the warlocks ’ power is something that might logically be found among others under certain conditions —perhaps the curse of a deity, the possession of a particular artifact, or the presence of one ’s ancestors at an ancient cataclysm. The effects of creating unique systems of magic in a cam-paign might include the following . • Speci ﬁ c classes might be favored classes for characters of a certain race or ethnic group. • Speci ﬁ c prestige classes or feats might be available only to characters who meet special racial or cultural require-ments. • Spells or feats might function better when used by char- acters with a special heritage or training. In general, it ’s preferable to offer advantages to a particular character combination than t o  c r e a t e  in s urm o un t a b l e  r e s tri c ti o n s . For example, if you decide that the Necromancers of Ilphaz are the most infamous of evil spellcasters in your campaign, you might des- ignate a handful of necromancy spells as Ilphatian spells. You could create a feat called Dark Lore of Ilphaz that pro- vides a caster level boost or similar advantage to a caster using an Ilpha- tian spell. Although a n y o n e  i n  y o u r  g a m e could still become a necromancer, the most dangerous nec- romancers are the students of Ilphatian lore whom your players will quickly learn to fear. Details like these are the stuff that memorable worlds are made of. The Magocracy Sorcerers, wizards, and other arcane spellcasters have many advantages over the common folk around them. In many lands, it ’s easy Illus. by M. Phillippi 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   173 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   173 9/15/04   9:40:32 AM 9/15/04   9:40:32 AM174for mages to accumulate wealth and in ﬂ uence. Like any other elite group, these mages will naturally seek to preserve their advantages and pass along these privileges to their heirs. A s o c i e t y  t h a t  f o r m a l i z e s  t h i s  r o l e  f o r  a r c a n e  s p e l l c a s t e r s  i s known as a magocracy —a realm ruled (directly or indirectly) by mages. A magocracy can be inclusive, recognizing that any spell-caster of suf ﬁ cient accomplishment is entitled to the rights and privileges of being a mage. Anyone desiring more of a say in how society is run need only take up arcane study and demonstrate some pro ﬁ ciency with the arcane arts. An exclusive magocracy, on the other hand, is founded on the tenet that arcane power —the key to membership in an elite group —is to be shared with none but a chosen few. In some lands of this sort, anyone undertaking the study of arcane magic other than the chosen elite of the realm is committing a crime punishable by exile or even death. In an autocratic magocracy, power is concentrated in the hands of a single mage (or possibly a small group), usually of signi ﬁ cant personal power. An autocrat might delegate some of his power to chosen agents or lesser autocrats, as in a feudal magocracy where a mage-king commands the fealty of a number of mage dukes or lords, each of whom rules over lesser mages in turn. Under this system, all mages are nobles (with the expected rights and responsibilities). Another autocratic magocracy could be bureaucratic in nature, with all mages together forming a privileged class in service to a nonmage king (and often comprising the true power behind the throne). Other magocracies are more democratic in nature; the mages of a kingdom might form an exclusive assembly that holds the power to make laws, levy taxes, or oversee the doings of the throne. Just as mages can easily accumulate political power, they can also provoke resentment and fear: An antimagocracy is a realm in which mages are censured for their dangerous and unpredictable nature. In the simplest form of antimagocracy, the practice of arcane magic is illegal, and anyone engaging in arcane spellcasting might be subject to ﬁ nes, imprisonment, or execution. Sometimes a rival type of spellcasting —the divine spells of clerics of a certain set of approved deities, for example —is the only form of sanctioned magic permitted in a realm. Agents of a sanctioned institution might seek out arcane spellcasters with inquisitional tactics, or (in a campaign with a long anti-arcane history) they might assume that arcane magic is an art long dead. In other lands, mages might be fettered by restrictive laws or rigorous obligations to the throne, and young people in such realms with the potential to work arcane magic might be made to choose between state servitude at an early age or a life of imprisonment or exile. Even outside the scope of a true antimagocracy, some forms of magic might be sanctioned in a realm while others are prohibited. Some lands might have laws against the practice of the warlock ’s dark arts, for example, and a fair number might take a dim view of necromancers, conjurers, and sorcerers on general principles.Deities of Magic Magic is power. In a world where arcane might is the single deadliest weapon that mortal hands can wield, deities are sure to have a keen interest in that power. Most pantheons have at least one deity whose portfolio includes magic, and in many pantheons, the power and destiny of arcane magic falls squarely under the ruling deity ’s in ﬂ uence and control. Despite the strength of most deities of magic, few possess a great number of cleric followers compared to other deities. Since many deities of magic venerate arcane spellcasting over all else, divine spellcasters never become as important to the maintenance and growth of their church. Boccob, as the deity of arcane spellcasting (not magic in general), has few cleric followers who don ’t also study arcane spellcasting. Of course, deities of magic whose portfolios include other important functions —such as Wee Jas, deity of death and law as well as magic —often have a powerful priesthood primarily concerned with the nonarcane aspects of the deity ’s divinity. In both churches, most high-ranking priests command both arcane and divine magic, often becoming mystic theurges as they pursue the paths in tandem. Clerics of deities who scorn magic as a tool used by those without the strength or courage to meet foes in physical battle tend to take an antagonistic view of arcane spellcasters, and many savage or barbaric races disparage arcanists because their warlike deities urge them down the path of physical valor rather than the one of study and cunning. Though an average orc is smart enough to recognize the battle ﬁ eld potential of arcane magic, Gruumsh ’s priests have little toler- ance for spellcasters; in a society built on brutality, an orc sorcerer or wizard must demonstrate even more strength and savagery than his warrior brethren just to survive. In human lands, the clerics of faiths celebrating strength and valor (the churches of Kord or Heironeous, for example) often work to limit the spread of arcane knowledge and the in ﬂ uence of its practitioners, possibly even serving as the inquisitorial arm of an antimagocratic government. The All-Arcanist Campaign One interesting and challenging twist on the arcane cam-paign is the all-arcanist campaign —a scenario in which every player character is a sorcerer, wizard, or other arcane spellcaste r . A party co m posed en tir el y of arcanists can be extraordinarily powerful at higher levels, but successfully completing adventures without access to the unique skills and abilities of the ﬁ ghter, cleric, and rogue (or having those skills only at lower levels because of multiclassing) can be a signi ﬁ cant challenge for those characters. Obstacles such as antimagic ﬁ elds  and monsters with broad spell immunities are much tougher to overcome when arcane power is the only weapon in the party ’s arsenal. A n  a l l - a r c a n i s t  c a m p a i g n  w o r k s  b e s t  i f  t h e  c h a r a c t e r s  involved each specialize in speci ﬁ c functions or roles —it becomes dif ﬁ cult for each character to carve out her own niche in the world if everyone tries to cover as many bases CHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   174 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   174 9/15/04   9:40:41 AM 9/15/04   9:40:41 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 175as possible. For example, a party consisting of an illusion- ist, a sorcerer with numerous damage-dealing evocations, a conjurer, and a multiclass cleric/wizard heading for the mystic theurge prestige class allows each character a chance to excel in different areas —the sorcerer and the conjurer ’s summoned creatures stand in for the party ’s ﬁ ghters, the multiclass cleric grants needed healing, and the illusionist provides stealth and deception akin to what a skilled rogue might be capable of. Taking the Leadership feat is another way for members of such a group to expand their skill base; ﬁ ghter or cleric cohorts can offer indispensable support to a party of mages. ARCANE EVENTS Whether their adventuring sees them engaged in courtly intrigue, plundering ancient crypts, or battling monstrous foes in underground ruins, all arcanists eventually return home. Away from dungeons, caverns, and the far planes of the cosmos, a spellcaster can rest, conferring with her peers as she absorbs the lessons learned from her adventures and begins to plan for the next one. But even within the reason-ably safe con ﬁ nes of a mighty city or strong-walled town, arcan e ad v e n tur e al w a ys beck o ns. Ri v al facti o ns o r guil ds o f  s p e l l c a s t e r s  p l o t  o r  s c h e m e  a g a i n s t  e a c h  o t h e r ,  s w o r n  enemies seek opportunities to foil an adventurer ’s plans or steal her treasures and knowledge, and great tournaments and fairs offer the opportunity for prizes and glory in the public eye. SPELL DUELS Few events are as spectacular or terrifying as a formal duel between two powerful arcane spellcasters. Even though arcanists frequently come up against each other in the course of adventuring, the chaos of the dungeon or the battle ﬁ eld often makes an accurate measure of skill impossible. In this highest test of arcane ability, a single mage meets another mage in a ritual spell duel that observes ancient and honor-able forms. At its basic level, a spell duel is an agreement between two spellcasters who know that con ﬂ ict between them is inevitable, and who wish to inject a kind of formality into what might otherwise escalate into a destructive brawl. No magic enforces the format of the duel except for what the duelists allow, and dishonorable spellcasters can and do break the rules. Once a caster gets a reputation for not honoring the rules of the spell duel, though, he generally can ’t expect his opponents to feel constrained by them either. Spell duels are usually a feature of sophisticated and magic- rich cultures, representative of an effort to control random magical violence. Savage or evil cultures rarely bother to observe the niceties of the spell duel tradition, and rival sorcerers in an orc tribe are generally too eager to begin blasting at each other to worry about the details of formal challenge and round-by-round protocol.The Formal Duel A proper spell duel follows a precise sequence of events, beginning with a challenge made and accepted. In the case of a weak spellcaster challenged by a powerful one, little dishonor is attached to a refusal; powerful wizards who make a point of challenging mere apprentices often ﬁ nd that the scorn they ’re eventually shackled with far outweighs the satisfaction of their easy victories. Any powerful spellcaster is free to defend her honor against a challenge from any other party, though, even a much less powerful mage. As such, professional spell duelists often bait intended victims into making the challenge, leaving them with no way to escape dishonor or death without contravening the dueling tradition. Once a challenge is made and accepted, the two duelists must agree on a place and time, as well as on whether the d u e l  w i l l  b e  s a n c t i o n e d  f o r  l e t h a l  o r  n o n l e t h a l  r u l e s .  I n  many magical societies, these negotiations are handled by seconds —allies or agents of the dueling parties who attend to the necessary details and later witness the duel. Local laws or customs might require the duelists to wait a certain amount of time before their duel, submitting their differences to an arbitrator ﬁ rst in the hope of ﬁ nding a peaceful solution, or waiting while a neutral of ﬁ cial is appointed to preside over the match. The choice of dueling ground is traditionally the preroga- tive of the challenged party, though it ’s expected that the appointed spot should be reasonably neutral and accessible to each side and any presiding of ﬁ cials. Due to the threat of collateral damage, man y cities hav e ordinances against dueling in the streets, requiring spell duels to be fought in speci ﬁ c places —open parks with few buildings nearby, ﬁ elds outside the city walls, or in the dungeons of the local wizards guild. Powerful wizards sometimes choose dueling grounds that are as potentially hazardous as anything the duel itself might unleash, such as on Avernus ( ﬁ rst layer of the Nine Hells), or amid the raging ﬂ ames of the Elemental Plane of Fire. On the day of the duel, both combatants follow speci ﬁ c procedures: 1. Both parties arrive on the ﬁ eld 1 hour before the appointed time. Neither party is permitted to cast any spell or use any magic item until the time of the duel. 2. In a nonlethal duel (see below), each duelist is given a visual and magical inspection by the of ﬁ cial, the seconds, or the other duelist to ensure that no prohibited magic items or spell effects are present. 3. At the appointed hour, the of ﬁ cial gives some sign (often a magical effect) that the duel has begun. Roll initiative. 4. First round: Cast any spell that can be cast so as to affect only the caster. 5. Second round: Ready an action to counterspell. 6. Third round: Begin dueling. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   175 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   175 9/15/04   9:40:42 AM 9/15/04   9:40:42 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNSThe duel ends when one of the combatants yields, is knocked unconscious, or is otherwise unable to continue dueling (such as by succumbing to a successful dominate person  spell). By custom, the dueling parties cannot make any magical preparations within 1 hour of the duel ’s start, but spells that last longer than 1 hour can be cast before the duelist enters the chosen site. Sometimes mages have been known to cheat by showing up only minutes before the duel (and after casting as many defensive spells on themselves as possible). An opponent is usually within his rights to insist that the duel not commence until 1 hour after the late arrival of the second party, but rash or con ﬁ dent mages sometimes decline to do so, unwilling to appear fearful of their opponent ’s preparations. When the duel proper begins, the dueling parties use the ﬁ rst round to prepare themselves, usually by casting a defensive spell. The second round is a customary pause as both parties ready themselves for each other ’s next move. In the third round, the spells start ﬂ ying. Because both parties have readied counterspell actions, whoever wins initiative can’t gain an advantage that his opponent has no chance to counter. Duelists follow this procedure voluntarily only in adherence to ancient custom, and disreputable mages have sometimes been known to let ﬂ y with lightning bolts  or vicious curses before their opponents are ready. Any duelist so attacked within the ﬁ rst two rounds is free to reply in kind with no loss of honor (as are his seconds, if the duelist is slain by such treachery). In some dueling traditions, the of ﬁ cial declares manda- tory pauses in the action (usually a 1-round break after 3 f u l l  r o u n d s  h a v e  p a s s e d ) ,  p r o v i d i n g  b o t h  c o m b a t a n t s  a n  opportunity to tend to their defenses again or ready another counterspell action. Dismissible spell effects (whether on the duelist or his opponent) are expected to be dismissed by each combatant, and other ongoing effects are dispelled by the ofﬁ cial, who is charged with having access to suf ﬁ cient uses of dispel magic  to allow him to maintain ultimate control of the duelists ’ spells. Many of ﬁ cials come prepared with wands or scrolls of dispel magic  or greater dispel magic  (for higher- level duels), paid for by the duelists themselves. Summoned monsters that can be communicated with are expected to be ordered to observe the pause in action, but of ﬁ cials have been known to expend signi ﬁ cant dispelling power dealing with creatures that fail to follow their summoning casters ’ commands to stand down. Generally, any and all magic items are legal in a spell duel (within agreed-upon restrictions; see Lethal and Nonlethal Duels, below). Fisticuffs, swordplay, and non-arcane spellcasting are also legal, for that matter, but few self-respecting mages resort to casting divine magic or brawling like drunken orcs as long as any spell remains in their arcane arsenal. Lethal and Nonlethal Duels A lethal spell duel is just what the name implies —anything goes. All spells cast function exactly as normal, and any contestant without a defense against disintegrate  should have thought twice before accepting a high-level transmuter ’s challenge in the ﬁ rst place. A nonlethal spell duel is generally designed to allow both parties to demonstrate their skill, or to satisfy a demand for honor that doesn ’t have life-or-death stakes. In a nonlethal duel, contestants generally agree to the following conditions.• Death effects are forbidden, including effects that entail a serious risk of killing or permanently incapacitating the opponent outright, such as disintegrate  or internal ﬁ re (see page 112). • Spells with any energy descriptor, the force descriptor, or the shadow descriptor are voluntarily “pulled, ” dealing half normal damage. • Spells that require melee attack rolls can strike to subdue within the speci ﬁ c formal conventions of the spell duel, taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls but dealing nonlethal damage instead of normal damage. • Summoned creatures must be directed to strike to subdue, taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls but dealing nonlethal damage against an opposing duelist (though summoned creatures are free to ﬁ ght other summoned creatures to the best of their abilities). As such, a caster in a nonlethal duel cannot summon creatures that he cannot communicate with or control. • Spells that create an incapacitating condition ( sleep , for example) are voluntarily dismissed or dispelled by an ofﬁ cial after one combatant has been rendered unable to continue, resulting in a loss for that combatant. Spells that incapacitate but allow a save each round (such as hold person ) are allowed to persist, potentially giving one caster a severe advantage as he pummels his opponent with spell after spell. Naturally, characters who know the Nonlethal Substitution feat enjoy a signi ﬁ cant advantage in nonlethal spell duels, since they need not reduce energy damage by half or take penalties on their spells ’ melee attack rolls. Even under rigorous guidelines, nonlethal spell duels are not always safe —more than a few mages have died from injuries in ﬂ icted by a careless (or surprisingly lucky) foe. In particular, pulling damage and attacking to deal nonlethal damage while casting spells is dif ﬁ cult; for each such spell cast in a nonlethal duel, the DM rolls d% secretly, with a result of 1 indicating that some unexpected mov ement or action of the target caused the spell to deal full damage or lethal damage as applicable. The restrictions of a nonlethal spell duel are voluntarily observed by each participant; nothing can stop a dishonor- able or desperate duelist from abandoning observation of the nonlethal forms at any point during the proceedings. Intentionally casting spells for full effect during a nonlethal duel is regarded as poor form at best, though, and once one duelist abandons the nonlethal restrictions, the other is free to escalate as well ( with no besmirching of her own honor). 176 Illus. by J.

The duelist can attempt a Bluff check immediately prior to casting a spell for full lethal damage, and the opponent and any witnesses are entitled to Sense Motive checks (with a bonus equal to the level of the spell the duelist intends to cast) to see through the ruse. If the Bluff check is successful (and the spell deals damage successfully), it appears that the caster tried to pull or deal non-lethal damage with the spell he cast, but failed to do so because of an unforeseen movement on the part of his foe. In the case of duels involving two player characters, the DM can ask for the intention to deceive to be relayed clandestinely. The DM then rolls the Bluff and Sense Motive checks secretly so that a character who suddenly finds herself blasted by a spell’s full power won’t automatically know whether the damage was intentional or whether the other character’s spell simply became lethal accidentally. It’s also possible to run this bluff in reverse when an arcanist wants to conceal that he is trying not to kill his foe (useful in duels when a high-level spellcaster wants to teach a talented upstart a lesson but doesn’t want to run the risk of killing him). This tactic is only effective when pulling the damage from energy spells (since taking nonlethal damage in a supposedly lethal duel is an obvious giveaway to the opponent). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 178TOURNAMENTS ARCANE Mages sometimes gather to test their skills in much the same way that knights and warriors meet to test themselves in contests of archery, jousting, or single combat. A tournament arcane is a great fair, festival, and bazaar that frequently causes all work in its host city to stop for a week or more, while both the highborn and the common folk ﬂ ock to watch contests of magical might. The Spire Perilous The origin of this competition and the stories of its ﬁ rst appearances in tournaments arcane are lost to history, but the spire perilous remains a perennial crowd favorite. A brightly colored banner is ﬁ xed atop a high mast on the top of a tall tower (often a turret of a nearby castle or the bell tower of a local church), and all participating mages line up on the ground at the tower ’s base with one simple objective —with- out setting foot inside the tower, be the ﬁ rst to return the banner to the ground by any means. Tactics range from the obvious ( ﬂ y, levitate , or spider climb  to scale the walls) to the forceful (simply grabbing the prize with telekinesis ) to the grandiose (summoning a force of air elementals to retrieve the banner and ﬁ ght off any casters threatening to do the same). Teleporting to the top of the tower is speci ﬁ cally prohibited in many versions of the challenge, and all contestants must begin with no functioning spell effects (though in some cases, persistent spells such as a contingent feather fall  might be approved by the presiding judge). In most tournaments, overcoming the spire perilous is c o m p l i c a t e d  b y  s o m e  f o r m i d a b l e  o b s t a c l e  ( a  g u a r d i a n  f o r  the banner, a nonlethal trap, or a spectacular barrier such as wall of ﬁ re). The real excitement, though, stems from the contestants quickly turning their magic on each other in an effort to prevent the competition from reaching the banner. Speci ﬁ cally lethal spells are discouraged or banned outright according to the rules of the competition, but questionable curses or dispels that just happen to place a rival in danger (such as causing a ﬂ y spell to fail when its bene ﬁ ciary is a hundred feet in the air) are ﬁ ne.The Grand Illusion Another of the most popular arcane challenges is the contest of the grand illusion. Wielding powerful illusion spells, mages create the most spectacular or fanciful images they can imagine, ranging from the mundane ( ﬂ attering portraits of noble ladies) to the epic (living recreations of great battles) to the impossible (great golden trees whose butter ﬂ y blooms leave faint gleams of faerie light in their wake). Contests of grand illusion are judged on the size, sophis-tication, ﬁ delity, and imagination of each contestant ’s entry. Master illusionists can become renowned throughout an entire kingdom for a single spectacular display, with the promise to perform even the simplest spells garnering the winner invitations to any banquet or ball in the land for years afterward. The Wizard’s Menagerie Arcane spellcasters are often associated with strange and wondrous beasts from all corners of the world (and sometimes beyond it), and a display of large and exotic menageries is another popular event during a tournament arcane. An arcanist wins great prestige for presenting the most outland- ish and improbable collection of creatures. Menageries may be judged against each other in a formal review or simply displayed to public acclaim. Naturally, the master of the menagerie is expected to take steps to ensure the safety of all onlookers. When formally adjudicated, collections are judged not only on the number of individual creatures but also on their rarity, appearance, and abilities. Large, unique, and visually striking specimens are regarded most highly. Anyone can catch a monstrous spider and present the foul creature for display, after all, but only the most skillful and daring wizards would presume to cage a bulette or an adult dragon. In an evil or particularly bloodthirsty society, a wizard ’s menagerie might serve as a stable from which the owner draws beasts and slaves for combat in gladiatorial contests against the menageries of other wizards. Gambling on such contests runs at a fever pace, and the wizard whose pets emerge triumphant from the bloody duels often claims a huge purse as his reward. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   178 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   178 9/15/04   9:40:55 AM 9/15/04   9:40:55 AMpqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs WHOSE ILLUSION WAS BEST? To determine the winning effort in a grand illusion contest, assign each entry an artistic value equal to the contestant ’s caster level + the spell level of the illusion (figment) spell used + the result of a Spellcraft check + the result of a suitable artistic skill check +1 for Spell Focus (illusion) or +2 for Greater Spell Focus (illusion). Suitable artistic skills include Craft (painting), Craft (sculpting), Perform for compositions with auditory com-ponents, or other skills as determined by the DM. For example, Seras, a 10th-level illusionist with the Spell Focus (illusion) feat, is participating in a grand illusion contest. He uses persistent image  (5th level) to recreate a famous dragon slaying. He gets a result of 29 on his Spellcraft check and a 13 on his Craft (painting) check, so the value of the illusion is 10 + 5 + 29 + 13 + 1, or 58. His rival Therea is a 13th-level sorcerer who also has Spell Focus (illusion). She uses major image  (3rd level) to create a fanciful scene of winged mice dancing with fairies, accompanied by a lively tune. She gets a 24 on her Spellcraft check and a 19 on her Perform (string instruments) check. The value of her illusion is thus 13 + 3 + 24 + 19 + 1, or 60, and Therea is declared the winner. The numeric value is simply an abstract measurement of how impressive and artistically rendered the illusion was from the perspective of a neutral observer. Since grand illusion judges are rarely neutral, though, hometown wizards often enjoy a signifi- cant advantage over their rivals. The DM may decide to simulate this advantage by giving the hometown hero an additional bonus of +1 to +5. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 179The Dweomerlist The single most iconic event of a tournament arcane is the dweomerlist, a test of arcane skill and combative mettle between mages. A dweomerlist is an open contest in  which all competing mages are paired against randomly chosen opponents for battle in nonlethal spell duels, to the delight and amazement of all onlookers. Dweomerlists are par- ticularly common in feudal magocracies, lands in which the mage ’s strength is an emblem of her right to govern and her readiness to serve her lord. A dweomerlist is often structured in several tiers of competi- tion so apprentices and archmages don ’t face off against each other. The format of the contest is usually a double-elimination tournament with multiple rounds. While most dweomerlists restrict or forbid lethal spells, death and injury are not unheard of. A few notorious mages have gained reputations, in fact, for unwarranted savagery in their tournament duels. Dweomerlists are often seen by competitors and specta-tors alike as opportunities for fame and advancement, and ambitious mages seeking wealthy or noble patrons often enter as a means of demonstrating their skills to prospective lords. In some kingdoms, a great dweomerlist is held every few years to decide who will be appointed Archmage, Royal Wizard, High Spellguard, or to some similar post. In other lands, dweomerlists are regarded as outdated and fatuous affectations, empty of any signi ﬁ cance other than determin- ing arcane bragging rights. ARCANE ORGANIZATIONS In a world where a relative few possess the ability to slay with a word, to bend the masses to their will, or to gather the secret intelligence that might topple thrones, it ’s only natural for others to seek to steal that power for themselves or sup- press its spread. In response, wizards and other spellcasters often ﬁ nd it advantageous to create associations dedicated to furthering their art and skill. An arcane organization offers many advantages to a typical spellcaster, including its availability as a resource for study and research that allows wizards and other arcanists who keep spellbooks to acquire new spells at no (or low) cost. For arcan- ists active in magical trade, an organization offers a potential network of buyers and sellers for weapons, wondrous items, and valuable arcane lore. More important, an organization can provide a spellcaster with protection. Powerful wizards guilds serve to shield mages from persecution by those who resent or fear their power. Wizards Guilds In general terms, a guild is a professional association whose primary concern is fostering the best possible environment for those who follow a particular trade. Skilled artisans and experts of all kinds form guilds in various lands; while mages are fewer in number, their professional needs are much the same. While people generally refer to such organizations as “wizards guilds, ” the term is often a misnomer; many guilds make no distinction between arcane spellcasters of different classes. Alternatively, some guilds are exclusively made up of a single type of nonwizard spellcaster, and are dedicated to that class ’s speci ﬁ c needs. Guilds usually charge a steep membership fee (often 10 to 100 gp in monthly dues) in addition to a fee to join. In return, a new member gains the sanction of the guild when casting spells for pay, creating magic items for sale, and engaging in other commercial arcane enterprises. A guild often owns a hall, tower, or retreat where members can reside (at least on a temporary basis), store valuable but unwieldy laboratory e q u i p m e n t ,  o r  m a k e  u s e  o f  a  c o m m o n  l i b r a r y .  A n y  m a g e  belonging to a guild can use the guild ’s facilities (generally at nominal cost) for magic item creation and spell research. Some of the most common sorts of wizards guilds include the following. Protective Guilds: Guilds formed in order to protect arcane spellcasters against the suspicion and distrust of nonwizards are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and the study o f  t h e  a rt  o f  m a gi c .  G u il d s  o f  t h i s  s o rt  e xi s t  t o  c h e c k  t h e otherwise overwhelming power that a crusading church or suspicious tyrant might bring to bear against the practicing arcanists of a realm. 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   179 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   179 9/15/04   9:40:58 AM 9/15/04   9:40:58 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 180 Regulatory Guilds: These guilds are formed to provide a legal and recognized forum for arcane study, most often in lands that have stern laws prohibiting the practice of arcane magic by those who don ’t belong to a sanctioned organiza- tion. Under such systems, arcanists are strongly encouraged to police their own ranks, defending the prerogatives and entitlements of their guild as they ful ﬁ ll their obligation to the ruling powers of the land that grant them the privilege to study magic.",

        "description":  "Carving or painting an arcane formula on a structure ’s walls works much like scribing a spell into a spellbook on a larger scale. It takes 100 square feet of wall space to serve as one page of a spellbook (so that a 9th-level spell requires 900 square feet, or an area 30 feet on a side), and with the increased size, an arcanist must use up a greater volume of special materials to record the spell (a cost of 300 gp per spell level). Recording a spell on a wall requires a 24 hours plus an additional 12 hours per 100 square feet of space used, and the spellcaster scribing the wall must succeed on a DC 15 Craft (painting) check. Carving or chiseling a spell into a wooden or stone wall requires a 24 hours plus an additional 48 hours per 100 square feet of space used, and requires the spellcaster to succeed on a DC 20 Craft (woodworking) or Craft (stoneworking) check. It ’s possible for a wizard to map out the precise symbols to be painted, cut, or carved without doing the ﬁ nal work. Preparing the surface by sketching or penciling the design in such a way that workers unfamiliar with the spell can then paint or carve its symbols requires a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) and takes 24 hours plus an additional 1 hour per 100 square feet, after which other workers can make Craft checks in the wizard ’s place and complete the process as described above. Structure Spells: Designing an entire building or edi ﬁ ce to preserve arcane knowledge is a challenging proposition, and a structure so designed must generally have an area of at least two 10-foot cubes per spell level to be recorded —pas- sages cut to precise measurements, mosaic paths picked out on a ﬂ agstone ﬂ oor, freestanding monoliths, walls, arches, buttresses, or almost any other type of feature whose design and orientation might convey information. Special materials must be used in the structure ’s preparation, costing at least 1,000 gp per 10-foot cube of area over and above the cost of construction. For those who wish it, a comprehensive breakdown of designing and building in a D\u0026D campaign can be found in Stronghold Builder ’s Guidebook . The structure must be designed by a wizard who knows the spell to be recorded. The wizard must make a successful Knowledge (architecture and engineering) check (DC 20 + the level of the spell to be recorded), then personally oversee construction for at least 4 hours per day. Construction is halted temporarily if the wizard can ’t oversee the job for any reason, and though there ’s no limit to how long it might take to complete construction, hired workers generally need to be paid their full daily wage while awaiting the wizard ’s return.

A wizard without this special instruction takes a –5 penalty on Spellcraft checks made to decipher, prepare, or copy structure spells. Tattoos By the use of tattoos, some wizards turn their own bodies into spellbooks, and high-level tattooed mages can often be covered with arcane designs and symbols from head to toe. Some spell tattoos can be placed so that the caster can read them simply by looking down, while others need the 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   186 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   186 9/15/04   9:41:26 AM 9/15/04   9:41:26 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 187aid of mirrors or even a familiar to study their tattoos. Tattooing offers a means of creating a spellbook that ’s virtually impossible to lose. I t  d o e s  h a v e  th e  dis a d v an ta g e  o f  th e  limi t e d  amount of usable spell-recording space on the average humanoid-shaped body, as well as the possibility of having to partially or com-pletely undress to reference every spell in one ’s repertoire. Tattooing also usually provides unmis- takable evidence of a character ’s arcane nature, denying the opportunity for anonymity that many arcanists crave. For creatures with humanoid forms, dif- ferent areas of the body can hold varying page-equivalents of spellbook informa- tion, depending on their size. Because tattoos must save on space to ﬁ t in a comparative- ly small area, they must be scribed with great care and the ﬁ nest reagents and inks, requiring 200 gp per page-equiva- lent, a time of 24 hours plus an additional 8 hours per spell level, and a Craft (tattooing) check (DC 20 + spell level if the caster scribes the tattoo himself; DC 10 + spell level if so m eo n e e lse d oes th e w o r k ). T o h a v e th e w o r k d o n e b y another tattoo artist, the wizard must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) to prepare a carefully executed sketch or diagram of the tattoo to be scribed. Tattoos that can’t be read by a wizard without assistance (those placed on areas of his body he can ’t always see ) must be scribed by someone else. Wizards who employ other forms of tattoo magic (such as those found in the F ORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign setting) can employ spellbook tattoos as well, but they must keep careful track of how much body space is allocated to each tattoo type. Tokens A number of wizards scribe spells as engravings on stones, bones, wooden rods, ivory or teeth, or statuettes. Instead of preparing and packing workbooks while adventuring, the wizard simply amasses a collection of these items, often car-ried in a nondescript belt pouch. A token of this sort can store a surprising amount of information in a relatively small space. The choice of material, its di- mensions and shape, and the markings on it all convey information on several lev-els at once. Scribing spells onto tokens requires the same expense in materials as for a stan- dard spellbook. An object holds any- where from 1 to 9 page-equivalents of spellbook in- formation, depending on its size. A single com- plex spell can be recorded on a set of similar objects, so a necroman- cer might record enervation  (4th level) onto four rune-scribed ﬁ n- ger bones with a capacity of 1 spellbook page each (although if one of the ﬁ nger bones goes missing, the others are unusable). Spellbook Object Size EquivalentSlingstone, finger bone*, hand crossbow bolt 1 pageCobblestone, arm bone*, rod 4 pagesSkull*, club, leg bone* 6 pagesStaff 9 pages* From a Medium creature. For each size category larger than Medium, increase the bone ’s spellbook equivalent pages by 50%, so that the skull of a Large creature could be used to scribe nine pages of spells. For each size category smaller than Medium, decrease the bone ’s spell equivalent pages by 50%. Scribing a spell on a spell token takes 24 hours plus an additional 8 hours per spell level, and the spellcaster must succeed on an appropriate Craft check (woodworking, gemcutting, or a similar skill) with a DC of 10 + spell level to record the spell successfully. Tokens can be designed for “reading ” by touch alone, e n a b l i n g  s p e ll s  t o  b e  p r e p a r e d  e v e n  i n  d a r k n e s s  o r  w h i l e  blinded, but a wizard preparing such spells must spend an additional 5 minutes per spell over and above the time the spells would normally take to prepare, and succeed on a Search check (DC 15 + spell level). Retries are permitted, so a wizard can take 20 on the check if desired, but doing so further lengthens the preparation time.A wizard studies his tattooed spellbookIllus. by D.

Though few arcanists take their views to extreme levels, some high-level wizards and sorcerers with an inclination toward megalomania have been known to think of themselves as deities in the making, moving beyond disrespect to an outright challenging of the deities themselves. For the majority of mages, though, arcane power comes with merely mortal ambitions, and they regard the deities in much the same way that any con ﬁ dent but sensible creature of signi ﬁ cant personal power does —as formidable beings worthy of worship or at least respect. Common Patron Deities Most human wizards who choose to revere a single deity above all others venerate Boccob, Lord of All Magics, or Wee Jas, the Ruby Sorceress. Boccob is a distant and aloof deity who rarely shows favor to his worshipers or acts against their enemies, but wizards admire the Archmage of the Deities for his intellect and meticulous nature, easily following his philosophies of objectivity, careful study, and inquiry into everything. Sorcerers and bards have less interest in Boccob ’s dispassionate teachings, and they usually take a patron deity whose traditions re ﬂ ect some aspect of their less structured lives. Wee Jas represents a darker approach to magic; while followers of Boccob seek arcane power as an end in itself, those who follow Wee Jas see magic as a means to achieving some measure of control over fate. The Witch Goddess favors those who have the strength to forge their own destinies, and powerful arcanists are heavily numbered among the rare mortals who do so. Because most sorcerers and bards disdain the notion of fate controlling their actions, few become fol-lowers of Wee Jas. Elf mages often revere Corellon Larethian, leader of the elven pantheon and patron of the magic that is the elf race ’s highest art. Elf culture and society perceives less estrange- ment between arcane and divine magic than most races, and elf mages often hold high positions in Corellon ’s temples. From a desire to strengthen their connection to the arcane history of their elf side, many half-elf spellcasters venerate Corellon Larethian as well. Uncommon Patron Deities Olidammara is a favorite deity among bards of many races, because the Laughing Rogue well suits the bard ’s love of bold escapades, quick wits, and song. Even evil bards often ﬁ nd Olidammara a worthy patron, and sorcerers with especially independent spirits often take him as their patron as well. Though few admit it openly, a great number of evil sorcerers and wizards revere Vecna, the Whispered One —possibly the greatest living wizard (and certainly the greatest unliving) of any age. Vecna ’s terrible accomplishments are still spoken of long centuries after his divine ascension, and those enthralled by the love of secret power are often drawn to worship the Maimed Lord. Rare Patron Deities Some spellcasters choose to revere deities whose portfolios don’t include magic, simply because their larger desires and beliefs echo that deity ’s teachings and laws. For some, the society in which they were brought up plays a part in this outlook, so a sorcerer might worship St. Cuthbert after being steeped in the tenets of that deity ’s faith as a youth. In other cases, the devout follower of a nonarcane deity might view her spellcasting talents simply as one more weapon in the arsenal of her faith, and virtually all churches count powerful arcane spellcasters among their faithful. Of the nonarcane deities, Pelor and Hextor are the ones most commonly venerated by arcane spellcasters. Pelor ’s faith is widespread, and his servants crusade tirelessly against evil, a credo that appeals to many good arcanists. Evil mages who believe that their arcane might gives them an innate right to power ﬁ nd the faith of Hextor, deity of tyranny, an appealing one. Many necromancers look upon Nerull ’s grim work with dark admiration. While not all necromancers worship the R e a p e r  o f  F l e s h ,  r a r e  i n d e e d  a r e  t h o s e  w h o  d o n ’t at least acknowledge his power. EPIC ARCANE CHARACTERS The Dungeon Master ’s Guide  provides rules for going beyond the 20th-level limit established in the Player ’s Handbook , taking epic characters to 21st level and higher. Though all epic characters use those rules to govern their advancement and capabilities, this section addresses some issues speci ﬁ cally relevant to epic arcane characters, including advancing to epic levels in prestige classes and new epic feats. BECOMING AN EPIC ARCANE CHARACTER The passage from everyday hero to epic hero is noteworthy in any campaign. Where epic ﬁ ghters and clerics might be known for their weapons or their devotion, epic arcanists are most often renowned for the spells they have created and the arcane power they have mastered over long years of study and toil. As such, arcanists can pursue one of two common paths to arcane epic power —spell creation and epic lore. Spell creation by an epic character might be a matter of successfully researching a new spell at each spell level, or as dif ﬁ cult as researching one speci ﬁ c spell or ritual that grants epic power when complete. In either case, it might be required that an epic arcanist share th e spell or spells by mentoring or tutoring lesser wizards, or scribe new spells into a universal spellbook kept by the deity of magic. Alternatively, a jealous deity might need to be placated with the gift of a spell that no one else knows, and the arcanist 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   188 620_17925_Chpt7.indd   188 9/15/04   9:41:35 AM 9/15/04   9:41:35 AMCHAPTER 7 ARCANE CAMPAIGNS 189who created it must destroy all knowledge of it (including his own) when done. Epic lore refers to some unique insight or revelation that must be realized by a prospective attainer of epic power —the discovery of a great and terrible book guarded by fearsome protectors, for instance, or piecing together a cosmic riddle hidden in the movements of the stars through long, meticu-lous observation. Simply gaining the ability to accomplish this task might require esoteric feats (such as those found in Book of Vile Darkness  or Book of Exalted Deeds ), or many ranks in unique Knowledge skills. EPIC WARLOCKS, WARMAGES, AND WU JEN The new character classes presented in Chapter 1 of this book use the same style of epic class progression that the Dungeon Master ’s Guide  presents for the character classes in the Player ’s Handbook .

A fortified enclave dedicated to one of theseclasses, the warmage, is mentioned in a sidebar in thebook. This adventure site details this isolated warmagetraining facility. Tarth Moorda is an adventure site that can be dropped into any remote area with a hot, dry climate. A variety ofadventures can take place here, though the intriguewithin the enclave can constitute an adventure in itself.As always, feel free to adapt the material presented hereas you see fit to make it work with your campaign. PREPARATION You (the DM) need the D\u0026D core rulebooks—thePlayer’s Handbook, the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and the Monster Manual —as well as Complete Arcane— to use this adventure site. The information presented hereutilizes the D\u0026D v.3.5 rules. To get started, print out the adventure site, including the map. Read through it at least once to familiarizeyourself with the situation, site, and major NPCs(particularly their motivations). You must decide whatkind of action takes place—whether the PCs simplystumble upon the place or have a reason to visit. Finally, review the information on warmages in Complete Arcane. Monster and NPC statistics are provided with each encounter area in abbreviated form. BACKGROUND On a high crag in the arid hills of the Abbor-Alz standsthe ancient fortress known as Tarth Moorda, whichonce housed the garrisons that defended Urnst againstgnoll and nomad raids from the Bright Desert.Abandoned when adventurers finally drove off thehumanoid tribes, Tarth Moorda stood empty for manyyears and eventually fell into ruin. Finally, some fifteenyears ago, the Duke of Urnst gave the old fortress to theOrder of the Fire Hawk, an enclave of warmages whowanted an isolated stronghold in which to train newinitiates. The Fire Hawks renovated the fortress and rein- forced its defenses. Some of the old buildings wererazed to make room for student quarters; others weresimply refurbished and put to new use. The area wasthoroughly scouted and defenses against mundane andmagical intrusion were set in place. 2Since the Fire Hawks made it their own, Tarth Moorda has become the principal training academy forUrnst’s warmages. The uncomfortable climate andrugged terrain of the surrounding area are consideredadvantageous for training recruits in the art of war,since they quickly become used to harsh conditions. About five years ago, Sereda Ostarte ascended to the position of high warmaster at Tarth Moorda. Like herpredecessors, Sereda runs the academy with an ironhand. Since she took over, the graduates of TarthMoorda have proven their valor and might on thebattlefield and shown an increased aptitude for strategyand tactics that is largely attributed to the changes shehas made in the curriculum. But Sereda is not as confident about the impregnabil- ity of the fortress as her predecessor was, and with goodreason. In recent months, the academy has begun tolose members. Five of her most promising students,two senior students, and one of her instructors—awarmaster—have died or disappeared. Unfortunateaccidents do claim the lives of occasional students, anddesertions are not unknown, since not all can toleratethe harsh conditions of training. But Sereda fears thatthe security of her enclave has been breached—and sheis right. Bendrik Sogoth, a Suel arcanamach, has infiltrated the complex posing as a student. A spy and assassinoperating on behalf of Rary’s rising empire in theBright Desert, he is responsible for the deaths anddisappearances. He is also gathering information aboutthe Fire Hawks for his employers, who wish to see theorder disbanded, or at least moved to another location.Bendrik’s fighting ability and sorcerer spells allow himto pose as a low-level warmage, putting him in a perfectposition to use his more subtle Suel arcanamach spellsto move unseen about the complex. Sereda understands better than her predecessors did that the warmages’ near-exclusive focus on damage-producing spells leaves them weak in other areas, suchas investigative and defensive magic. She has beenworking with the enclave’s priest of Heironeous onways to discover the source of the problem. So far,divinations have pointed to somewhere inside thecomplex and to the Bright Desert, depending upon thespell used, but Bendrik’s defenses have preserved hiscover. Sereda is interested in retaining the services ofagents who can uncover the perpetrator. Meanwhile,she works to ensure the safety of her remainingstudents and staff and minimize the demoralizingeffects of the previous incidents.TARTH MOORDA Tarth Moorda is situated on a high peak on the edge ofthe Duchy of Urnst, overlooking the Bright Desert. Itsisolation helps to maintain the discipline required for amilitary training camp, and the site is highly defensibleagainst threats originating from the ground. Againstthreats from the air, its occupants must depend on theirmagic. The fortress spans the entire top of the peak on which it rests. Portions of the slope have been leveled toprovide firmer foundations for buildings, creating athree-tired, terraced effect. The building known as theHigh Warmaster’s Quarters (areas 15-18) rests aloneatop the highest tier. On the second tier are the otherbuildings of the complex, except for the stable, whichstands on the lowest tier. FEATURES Access to Tarth Moorda is via the main gate (area 2) andthe two postern gates (at the rear of the Students’Quarters and the Warmasters’ Hall). The complex hasthe following features. Ledges The ledges that separate the three tiers are roughly 30feet high and span a horizontal distance of about 20 feet.Stairs built into the roads and walls within the complexallow access from one tier to another. Curtain Wall (EL 6) A 20-foot-high stone curtain wall surrounds the entirefortress. The rear portions of three buildings—theHigh Warmaster’s Quarters, the Students’ Quarters,and the Warmaster’s Hall—are actually built into thecurtain wall. The wall is 10 feet thick, with crenellationsalong the outside and a walkway made of smooth, fittedstones behind them. Arrow slits pierce the curtain wall at 20-foot intervals. Because of the thickness of the wall, these slits limitline of sight to directly ahead. Tarth Moorda’s defendersuse them primarily for firing ray spells, magic missiles, and Melf’s acid arrows. The wall includes three round towers that extend 10 feet above the rest of the wall. Two of these towers aresituated on the lowest tier of the complex, flanking themain gate (area 2). The third stands on the second tier,just below the armorer’s shop (area 6). Stockpiles of material components are cached about every 20 feet along the walkway and at the top of eachtower. Neatly stacked piles of javelins, arrows, andother standard missile weapons are also readily3available to defenders, as are pitch, rags, oil, flint, and tinder for creating normal flaming arrows and pots ofboiling pitch. These mundane defenses have beenaugmented in recent years, since Sereda is a firmbeliever in covering contingencies such as nullificationof magic. Four regular guards and four students patrol the curtain wall around the clock. Four of them are relievedevery four hours. These guards are fighters that Seredahas recently employed to beef up security, and theyanswer to the watch captain of the moment (see area 3). Hired Guards (4): hp 5; see The Order of the Fire Hawk. Students (4): hp 3; see The Order of the Fire Hawk. Roads The buildings within the complex are connected bywell-maintained roads made of hard-packed dirt. Sincethe inhabitants rarely have occasion to ride, these trailssupport mostly foot traffic. The roads are usually levelexcept where wide stone steps connect the tiers.Because the area receives little rain, the roads tend to besomewhat dusty. ENTRYWAY Tarth Moorda’s main entrance is well fortified anddefensible. 1. Hailing Point (EL 5) At a sharp bend in the road on the lowest tier of theoutpost is an octagonal cleared area, paved with stone,that functions as a hailing point at which visitors canstate their business to the guards. Anyone standing here has a good view of the High Warmaster’s Quarters and the top portions of the otherbuildings. The hailing point is clearly visible from allthree towers and from the northern portion of thecurtain wall.",

If they fail tocomply, the guards open fire with missile weapons andspells, and the watch captain arrives within 2 rounds tolend firepower (see area 3). If the visitors stop and answer, the guards then ask what their business is and whether they mean harm toanyone within the complex. If the trap indicates thatthey have lied at any point, the guards deny them entryand notify the Warmasters’ Council. If visitors whohave lied persist in trying to gain entrance, the guardsattack. A member of the Warmasters’ Council arriveswithin 3 rounds and, if the visitors are still alive, decideswhether to admit them or order them driven off. 2.

About a dozen students are in the commonroom at a time; the rest are studying, sleeping in theirrooms, attending classes or weapon practice, or stand-ing guard, depending on the time of day. Students (12): hp 3; see The Order of the Fire Hawk. 8. Student Sleeping Rooms (EL 2, 4, or 13) Each of these chambers houses eight students, but noneare filled to capacity at present. Two of the rooms on theupper floor are for the eight senior students in the complex. Bendrik sleeps with four other students in thesoutheasternmost chamber on the first floor. Read or paraphrase the following when the charac- ters enter one of these rooms, adjusting as needed forthe time of day. Rarely are these chambers completely empty, since the students rotate guard duty and classes around the clock.The books on the nightstands are textbooks on battletactics.",

The diarynotes the exact dates and times that he heard mysteri-ous sounds at night, plus a few complaints fromstudents about “being watched.” DINING HALL This building is where food is stored, prepared, andserved. Most of the vegetables for the complex aregrown on the surrounding hillsides, but the fruits andspices are brought in from Urnst. Hunting parties leavethe complex every two weeks to search for game. 11. Cistern House Because of the dry climate, the order conserves waterreligiously. Rainwater is piped into the cistern here. The cistern is about 10 feet deep and holds 9,000 gallons (a three-month supply for one hundred people if wateris rationed, otherwise a month’s supply). The drainsfeed the rainwater collected in the gutters of thisbuilding and the refectory into the cistern.This small building has stone walls and a slate roof with metal gutters suspended all around theedges. Two drainpipes, one on the east side andone on the west, run into the building through-holes in the walls. Two doors, both standing ajar,give access to the structure. Two more drainpipesrun into the building from the gutters around theadjacent structure. Beyond the doors is a short flight of steps lead- ing down to a single room with a dirt floor. In thecenter of the floor lies a flat, oval piece of woodabout 10 feet by 15 feet. Set in each end is a trap-door with an iron handle. The drainpipes plungeinto the ground a short distance from the trap-doors. Buckets are piled neatly in the corners ofthe room, and a book hangs from a chain by thesouth door.This room is furnished with a bed, a wardrobe, atable and chair, a nightstand, and a large chest nextto the wardrobe. In the center of the yellowbedspread is a hawk, picked out in crimson thread. The double doors of this chamber open to reveal aspacious sanctuary dedicated to Heironeous. Astatue of the god stands in the front, next to thealtar, and on the opposite side is a pulpit with aholy water font next to it. On the altar is a goldaltar service consisting of several candlesticks, abowl, and a censer.The chapel’s double doors stand open, revealing a15-foot-by-15-foot area ringed with statues of vari-ous deities. Pelor is here, along with Wee Jas,Fharlanghn, Boccob, and others. Before each deityare several lit votive candles, and each offering boxcontains a few coins. On the wall is the inscrip-tion, “Temper your power with wisdom.” Acrossfrom the main entrance is another set of doubledoors, and a stairway on the west side leads up.8Students must gather water here and sign for each bucketful they take. Each of the buckets holds 5 gallonsof water. The trapdoors allow easy dipping of buckets. 12. Food Storage The order’s food stores are kept in these chambers. 12a. Smokehouse Student hunting parties bring the excess game they killhere for preservation. The halfling cook (see area 13) tends the fire in this chamber and determines when the meat is sufficientlycured. 12b. Pantry Partly belowground, this chamber functions as a rootcellar and pantry. The three cooks enter this chamber perhaps a dozen times a day in search of ingredients. 13. Refectory (EL 11 or 15) This chamber functions as the dining room for theorder. The students and faculty dine together here. Each person serves himself from the tables, cafeteria-style,then takes his plate to one of the long tables. The highwarmaster rarely dines here, preferring to have hermeals brought to her rooms.Creatures: All the students and faculty congregate in this area at mealtimes; about fifteen students arepresent at any other time. Students (15 or 52): hp 3; see The Order of the Fire Hawk. Senior Students (8): hp 17; see The Order of the Fire Hawk. Warmasters (6): male or female warmage 10; hp 38. 14.

Should the characters try to force their way in, the guards employ their weapons and spells to the best oftheir ability while calling for help.

Inner Circle Chamber This room is reserved for conferences between the highwarmaster and her six underlings. This room is unoccupied except for weekly staff meet- ings. At such gatherings, the warmasters discuss theprogress of various students, discipline problems, andsafety issues. The books contain the progress reports on various students. A red line drawn through a student’s recordindicates death, and a mark that resembles a pair ofwings at the end of an entry indicates a disappearance. Asuccessful Decipher Script check allows a character toread the code that the warmasters use to track a student’sprogress and discover that the deaths and disappear-ances were among the order’s most promising students,and that only one of these ever constituted a seriousdiscipline problem. Characters who read the books alsodiscover that Bendrik is one of three students who doesnot seem to be progressing as he should. His problem, asnoted here, is that his ability to cast certain spells seemsunreliable, and his technique is poor for certain spells. Alack of proper discipline is blamed. The other twostudents seem to have similar difficulties. THE ORDER OF THE FIRE HAWK The current high warmaster of Tarth Moorda is SeredaOstarte.

Large pieces of slateare affixed to the walls, and on each is what appearsto be a battle plan, with circles to represent variousforces and arrows marked with spell names.The entry hall to this building is festooned withportraits and statues. Their nameplates proclaimthem to be previous high warmasters and heroesof the Fire Hawk.This spacious chamber is divided into sections—one for armor, one for melee weapons, and one forranged weapons. All are neatly organized by typeand size and stored on racks.11savant, another is an expert with the use of wands, and a third spent time as a fighter before becoming awarmaster. The six warmasters directly oversee thetraining of initiates, teach classes, and monitorwargames in the open areas of the complex. Sereda has for some time been attempting to ferret out information about Rary’s sinister realm in theBright Desert. Unbeknownst to her, a spy for Rary iseven now in the midst of her order, gathering informa-tion about its strengths and weaknesses and preparingto eliminate some of its more powerful members,including Sereda herself.

Bendrik has studiedwarmages for years, and the Order of the Fire Hawk isnot the first group of them that he has infiltrated. Bendrik has been responsible for all the deaths and disappearances the Fire Hawks have experienced in thepast few weeks. He has used the benefits of his MageSlayer feat and his ability with weapons, as well as hisown spells and his dagger of venom, to kill most of them quickly and quietly. Each night that he does not haveguard duty, Bendrik prowls a portion of the complexinvisibly, seeking information that he can transmit tohis employers via the sending stone with which they provided him. With his sorcerer spells, his Suel arcanamach spells, and his Extra Spell feats, Bendrik can actually castmost of the spells to which a 1st-level warmage hasaccess. The rest he can simulate through his spell-likeabilities and the spells stored within his ring of theurgy. When he uses his chill touch and ray of frost spell-like abilities, or produces a spell effect from his ring of theurgy, he makes a Bluff check opposed by the observers’ Spot or Spellcraft checks to hide the factthat he is not actually casting the spell. He gains a +2bonus on his Bluff check for his ranks in Spellcraft.The warmasters gain the same bonus on their Spot orSpellcraft checks to oppose. Bendrik keeps his scrolls in reserve and uses them to replenish his ring. But the fact that he must guesswhich additional spells he will need means that heoccasionally doesn’t have access to a spell that isdemanded. This lack has caused the warmasters to notethat he is not making as much progress as he shouldand to speculate as to the cause. Bendrik knows that hecannot stay here much longer, and he hopes to deal theFire Hawks a lethal blow by assassinating one or moreof the warmasters before he leaves.",

Afterbreakfast, the students divide into groups, with somegoing to class in the Warmasters’ Hall, some participat-ing in outdoor weapon or spell practice, some on guardduty, and the rest sleeping. These positions rotatethroughout the day. Lunch occurs at midday, andsupper at dusk. The students have the opportunity totalk and play games in the lobby of the Students’Quarters in the evenings and between their otherengagements. Sereda Ostarte spends some time each day observing the students, as do the other warmasters. Each keepsnotes on the students’ progress, and the councilmembers compare notes weekly. The senior students are those who have spent some time in the armed forces or adventuring, but returnedto the academy for private tutoring from the instruc-tors. In return for this service, they act as guards, advi-sors, and residence hall monitors. ADVENTURE OPTIONS The PCs could visit Tarth Moorda for many reasons. AsDM, you know best how to work a particular site intoyour storyline, but you can use the ideas below as inspi-ration. • The PCs happen upon the site while traveling from Urnst to the Bright Desert. • The characters have been sent to the complex by the Duke of Urnst in response to Sereda’s request for aidin finding a possible infiltrator. • Sereda heard of the PCs’ exploits and invited them to the complex for a special mission.
