This organ 17 2 RETPAHC PEED EHT SRETSAM Central Nervous System The most highly developed of an aboleth’s organs is its cen- tral nervous system—in particular, its brain. An aboleth’s brain is a massive structure that accounts for nearly one-fi fth of the creature’s body mass. The brain is various shades of purple and looks somewhat similar in shape to an aboleth without its long tail. The brain consists of fi ve major sections, each of which is discussed below. Frontal Lobe (1): Located at the front of the brain, this cone-shaped lobe is pale purple and covered with thousands of tiny, hornlike protrusions. This lobe has two primary functions. First, it generates an aboleth’s powerful enslaving mental attack. Second, it functions as a telepathic core that enables the creature to converse with (cid:4) (cid:5) its enslaved minions, while preventing the minions from (cid:2) sensing anything in the aboleth’s mind but its unyielding domination and control. (cid:1) (cid:3) Primary Lobe (2): The primary lobe is located directly behind the frontal lobe and above the ventral lobe. It is here that an aboleth’s primary brain functions occur: thought, logic, intelligence, reason, and everything else that brains make possible in other creatures. The creature’s three optic nerves attach to this portion of the brain. Ventral Lobe (3): Although the ventral lobe looks like four separate tentacle-shaped lobes radiating out from below the primary lobe, it is in fact a single lobe, connected on the underside of the brain. The four arms of the lobe are A typical aboleth brain (numbers keyed to text references) striped with alternating bands of dark and light purple, and pumps blood throughout the body and maintains blood pres- they store the memories an aboleth has created for itself and sure, just as a normal heart does.

In addition to providing the creature with all-around vision, the eyes can be used to aim, direct, and emit powerful supernatural effects. These effects aside, the eye of a beholder is a wondrous and complex organ that has long been the obsession of countless sages and wizards. (cid:4) A beholder’s eyeball is remarkably hard and solid, about as strong as a similarly sized ball of stone. While at rest, the eyes have a round, brilliantly colored iris (1). The iris seems to be some sort of translucent crystal (cid:3) consisting of hundreds of interlocking sheaves, each (cid:5) of which is capable of independent movement. This allows a beholder amazing control over the shape of its iris and the amount of light that is allowed to enter the (cid:1) (cid:2) eye. A beholder can adjust its iris to almost any shape imaginable, and can even expand it to the rim of its eye (cid:5) socket to give the appearance of having no iris at all. Curiously, a beholder’s eye doesn’t have a single lens. (cid:3) Rather, an eye can have as many as a dozen differently sized and shaped lenses (2), all capable of independent (cid:5) rotation and movement and linked to the movement of (cid:4) the iris. By adjusting these lenses and the iris, a beholder can aim with its eye ray. The numerous lenses have the added benefi t of granting the creature exceptional vision.

SLAVE PEN (EL 3) A short, steep slope leads down to a large cave lit by several dim yellow oil-lanterns. Crude sleeping pallets lie along the walls. Most are empty now. A long trestle table stands at one end of the cave, with a small, smoky cooking fi re nearby. Two other passages exit the cave, but they’re a good 15 feet above the fl oor, reachable only by a narrow and treacherous ledge that circles the pitlike fl oor. An armed bugbear stands here, keeping watch over a handful of other humanoids. Reaching the fl oor of the pen, or the ledge from the pen fl oor, requires a DC 15 Climb check. Navigating the ledge to reach the east or south exits requires a DC 10 Balance check or a DC 15 Climb check. The neogi and umber hulks, all quick and skillful climbers, easily circle the pen in either direction. A ladder is kept drawn up on the ledge near the north entrance, where the guard is stationed; when he needs to get someone into or out of the pen, he lowers the ladder. The neogi have a total of seven human slaves (two here and fi ve in area 4), fi ve orc slaves (two here and three in area 2), and six goblin slaves (three here and three in area 2).

Nothing can destroy a band of heroes quicker than having a powerful fi ghter switched from an ally to a foe by a spell of mental domination. Any steps that improve a character’s Will save are virtually mandatory for an aboleth hunter. Characters who expect to face aboleths would be well advised to take the Iron Will feat at the fi rst opportunity, and to acquire defensive items such as cloaks of resistance if at all possible. Use of the protection from evil spell exemplifi es a particularly good tactic to employ against aboleths; a charac- ter so protected cannot be made to attack his comrades. The third diffi culty in defeating the aboleths lies in their preferred environment, the cold and lightless waters of the underground. Any aboleth seriously threat- ened by land-bound attackers can simply retreat into the dark depths of its lair. Spells such as water breathing and freedom of movement are absolutely essential for cornering aboleths that have chosen to retreat from a fi ght. Polymorph is another good tactic, as is using summon monster to conjure an aquatic monster that can go where the heroes cannot. Without the ability to pursue aboleths into their submerged lairs, aberration hunters fi nd that the monsters are exceed- ingly hard to fi nish off.
