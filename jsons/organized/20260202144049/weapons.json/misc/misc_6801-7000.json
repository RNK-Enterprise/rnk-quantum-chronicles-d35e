PLOT IN A HORROR CAMPAIGN To make a game truly horrifi c, you need more than mood, new rules, or even a truly scary villain. You need a solid plot, one that will engross the players and encourage them to keep going to see what happens next, to really get into character. It can be the same sort of plot you would fi nd in any other fantasy campaign. Dungeon crawls, wilderness exploration, behind-the-lines wartime missions, and political maneuver- ing all have great horror potential. The only true requirement is that the story be solid and believable in the context of the setting: Anything else will make it diffi cult for your players to really feel what their characters are experiencing. Don’t create all your horror stories as mysteries. Mystery and horror fit well together, and horror usually contains elements of the unknown. But if every story is a mystery, the players can grow bored with a too-familiar pattern. Include “Let all those you love leave you even as I do!” mysteries frequently, but don’t rely on them exclusively. ahead of time, you probably won’t want to use amnesia as an LONG-TERM HORROR excuse to change major details of a character’s background. Creating the proper mood of horror is not the hardest part of The player created the character she wants to play, and a player running a horror campaign. Rather, maintaining that mood is might naturally object to being told that her character is not often far more diffi cult.

Such curses cannot be invoked throughout by using the following techniques. through the simple casting of a spell but only through a com- bination of great emotional power and horrifi c circumstance.

In the hands of experienced roleplayers, this is an invaluable tool. If you simply describe to the players a few dreams their characters have over the course of an adventure or campaign, being certain to include details that are not obvious references to ongoing events; the players can take it upon themselves to determine what these dreams mean from their characters’ perspective. You might decide to let a player dictate her character’s dreams (or at least those that have no bearing on the plot). For example, tell the player that her character has had a horrifi c nightmare, and then ask the player to describe the dream for you rather than vice versa. (Some players might not enjoy being put on the spot, so consider allowing them time between games to come up with this.) This technique encourages the player to give some thought to her character’s goals, fears, and thought processes. It also offers you knowledge of the character’s fears—information that you can put to use later in the campaign. CONSTRUCTING DREAMS It’s a common misperception among DMs and authors that all it takes to create a dream sequence is to describe random weirdness and some nonsense imagery. In fact, the majority of dreams contain their own form of logic and their own pat- terns, even if these are not easily recognizable. To create an in-game dream that feels genuine, it’s important to construct the scene properly. Making Events Feel Dreamlike If you want to make a scene feel like a genuine dream, subtlety is your best tool. Dreams tend to feel quite real—at least at fi rst. Consider the following possibilities, and keep in mind that everyone in the dream treats the situation as though it Sometimes the worst were totally normal. evil isn’t supernatural Everything is Normal but for One Major Detail: at all The PCs are no longer the same race they were. Everyone is speaking a different language. A character has forgotten how to wield a sword or cast spells.

A cadaver golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs around 500 pounds. They speak Common and any other single language, depending on race and region, and they can learn other languages in the course of their existence. COMBAT Cadaver golems do not hesitate to destroy anyone or anything that threatens them or stands between them and their goals. Some develop ambitions for power or wealth, while others simply wish to be left alone. All are murderous. Cadaver golems seek out humanoids who possess abilities they want in order to kill their targets and steal those abilities. A cadaver golem tends not to use its Power Attack feat on the fi rst few attacks, instead calling it into play once it is certain that it has a good chance to hit its chosen target(s). Assimilate Flesh (Ex): A cadaver golem can choose to replace one of its limbs, sense organs, or other parts with a similar part taken from a living or recently deceased humanoid. Doing so grants the golem skills and abilities associated with that particular body part. The golem cannot, however, gain skill points in excess of its HD +3. Thus, if the golem acquires the hands of a rogue and wishes to assimilate some of the rogue’s Open Lock skill ranks, the golem will have to lose some of its current skill ranks. The golem can never gain more ranks from a body part than that individual possessed; thus, if the rogue had 4 ranks in Open Lock, the golem can gain no more than 4 ranks from his hands, even if it’s willing to lose more than 4 previously acquired Cadaver golem skill points.",
