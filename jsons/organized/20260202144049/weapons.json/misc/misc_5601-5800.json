Strahd calls himself the “fi rst vampire,” but the claim seems unlikely. The details of his story are set down in the Tome of Strahd, with key excerpts presented on page 22. Strahd is a tall man, standing just over 6 feet. His body is lean and hard, and his gaunt face has strong features and prominent cheekbones. His eyes are dark and hypnotic, like deep pools with subtle refl ections of red light, but when he is enraged they burn like red-hot coals. His skin is usually pale, but it becomes fl ushed with each feeding and retains that healthy-looking color for several hours. His elongated and thin fi ngers have long, sharp nails. His fangs are not obvious unless he wants them to be noticed—he can speak and even yawn without revealing his true nature. When he attacks, however, the fangs lengthen to protrude from his mouth.

KAVAN THE GRIM Strahd has been experi- menting to create vampire minions with the ability to move about in daylight. He might even be planning to create a population of the daywalker breed (see Strahd’s Dynasty on page 15). Among the fi rst of these creations, Kavan the Grim is a savage brute who relishes his new ability to cause mayhem under the noonday sun. His ferocity makes him a poor covert spy, but he can accurately report on the PCs’ combat abilities. Kavan hurries toward the party at top speed, making no effort at stealth—once he closes to 90 feet, the PCs notice his approach. On his fi rst turn in combat, Kavan rages and moves to attack the nearest character. He fi ghts until he drops to 0 hit points, then drifts off in gaseous form toward the crypts beneath Castle Ravenloft. Kavan’s daylight attack should be a clear warning to the PCs that they are not up against any normal vampire foe. Unlike Strahd, though, Kavan suffers from the normal vampire aversions.

A wide swath of clearer ground forms something like a path or trail, though there are no clear marks of anything passing this way. AMBUSH! If the PCs show signs of having spotted any of the were- wolves, the one in elf form steps out from behind the tree, holding his bow at the ready. “What evil do you bring to this forest?” he calls out, fi rst in Elven, then in accented Common. He interacts with the PCs in this manner, playing the part of an innocent, if defensive, woodland elf. While this conversation goes on, his two allies (in wolf form) move around in the heavy undergrowth to the points on either side of the trail that are closest to the PCs, moving at half speed and trying to remain unnoticed (Hide +17). The werewolf in elf form might make one or more of the following statements in response to the PCs’ questions or remarks. His responses are essentially truthful, if not literally honest. His general attitude seems to be defensive rather than outright hostile. However, a Sense Motive check (against his untrained Bluff check result of –1) can reveal that something is amiss. In particular, his eyes constantly fl ick toward the undergrowth near the PCs. “My people call this woods our home. It is not dangerous.” “Of course the ignorant villagers fear the woods!
