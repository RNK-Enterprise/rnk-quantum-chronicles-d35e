Unless the characters slay the garngrath, thousands will perish before its other worldly gluttony.

Madness plagues the kuo-toas. Owing to centuries of inbreed- ing and dedication to a perverse deity, a large number of kuo-toas are mentally unstable. Some kuo-toas slide over into utter lunacy, turning into murderous creatures. Crazed kuo-toas are no larger than their fellows, but their mental illness makes them animalistic, giving them abnormal might, agility, and resilience. Kuo-toa whips use their crazed underlings as disposable shock troops. In some cases, however, a leader exiles the insane to areas just outside the main settlement, leaving them to fend for themselves. The crazed kuo-toas are then no longer a strain on the community’s resources, but they still act as that settlement’s outermost ring of defense. Strategies and Tactics Crazed kuo-toas hurl themselves at their enemies, heed- less of safety.

Because the mind fl ayers of Thoon have been traveling across the planes gathering quintessence, their hoard is a good place to introduce particularly weird, otherw orldly treasures, such as strangely marked coinage, bizarre and disturbing art, and magic items with ornamenta- tion that is clearly of extraplanar origin. The value of quintessence—to anyone except the follow- ers of Thoon—is deliberately left vague. This doesn’t have to remain true in your campaign, however. Perhaps quintes- sence can be used as a substitute for experience points in item and construct creation. Quintessence could instead be a material component for new spells or rituals you introduce into your campaign, or it could be an optional component that makes certain types of magic more potent. Items and constructs created using quintessence can have weird quirks and drawbacks. Spells cast using it are bizarre or take on aberrant aspects. The moral implications of using a material gathered from innocent (or not) sentient creatures also comes into play. If you use quintessence in one or more of these ways, or make it valuable at all, consider that value when assigning treasure to encounters you create using the followers of Thoon.

They stop eating only long enough to molt and reproduce. Since they must consume immense amounts of food, the availability of suitable habitats for them is limited.

Siege beetles lay their eggs by de- positing them into large crevasses and similar geographic features. They cover their clutches with carcasses and other detritus. A female siege beetle lays two to four eggs surrounded by a membrane fi lled with sticky ectoplasm. A single egg is over 15 feet in circumference and Siege beetle looks like a brown, fleshy seedpod. In a few months, the eggs hatch, releasing SOCIETY nymph-stage beetles. Siege beetle nymphs molt several times Siege beetles have no society.
