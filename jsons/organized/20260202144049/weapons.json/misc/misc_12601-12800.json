It also features a new race, the half-ogre, and descriptions of three creatures—the desmodu, the loxo, and the thri-kreen—that originally appeared in Monster Manual II.They are included here so that the DM (or a player running one of them as a character) can take full advantage of the specialized equipment these creatures use, as described in Chapter 5 of this book. ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMALS Anthropomorphic animals, sometimes called anthro- pomorphs, are animals with humanoid characteristics—or perhaps humanoids with animal characteristics. They retain many of the qualities of the animal on which they are based, but they are sentient and have a humanoid form. Many anthro- pomorphic animals of the same kind form unique societies with their own culture, language, and religion. Anthropomorphic animals speak the language of their humanoid forms, as well as any language they have devel- oped as a people. SAMPLE ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMAL This example uses a donkey as the base creature. Onager (Anthropomorphic Donkey) Medium-Size Monstrous Humanoid",

Shamans may also invoke the special powers spirits have by their very nature, assuming one of the spirit\u0027s aspects for a while. The main tool of the shaman is the rite, enacted as a chant, dance or other performance intended to attract the spirits\u0027 attention and direct the shaman\u0027s will into his dealings with them. Also, not so inclined to direct conflict, the shaman focuses more on learning and increasing his non-combat skills.

The ten classes presented here are of particular inter- est to rogues and bards, although any character who meets the requirements is welcome to adopt one. See Complete Adventurer DREAD PIRATE Thugs and cutthroats in every port lay claim to the title “pirate,” but actually making a fortune through piracy is no easy task. A dread pirate, however, has mastered every aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network of contacts tells him when a particularly valuable cargo is shipping out. After a fl awless ambush at sea, he swings aboard the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand. Once he and his shipmates have overpowered the prize vessel’s crew, they liberate the cargo and make their escape. Later, the dread pirate meets representatives from the black market in some isolated cave and sells his newly acquired cargo for a handsome profi t. Some dread pirates accomplish their goals through fear, killing indiscriminately and ruling their ships at rapier-point. Others minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious sort of chivalry, perhaps realizing that the captain and crew of a prize ship are more likely to surrender if they believe they’ll live to see port again. Now and then a dread pirate takes his chivalric streak a step further and preys only on the ships of enemy nations—or even solely on other pirates.

He’s skilled at moving stealthily through all types of dungeon terrain, detecting and disarming inconvenient traps, bypassing locks, locating treasure, and fi lching protected items. The typical dungeon delver has forsaken people skills to concentrate on the nuts and bolts of dungeon explo- ration and treasure retrieval. Rogues make excellent dungeon delvers, as do the rare bards and rangers who choose to pursue this track. (Most bards would miss their admiring audiences, however, and rangers might fi nd it diffi cult to acquire all the necessary skills.) Since a dungeon delver frequently works alone, he must learn to think and act independently, relying upon no one but himself. Even when exploring a dun- geon in the company of other adventurers, he often keeps to himself-scouting ahead, disarming traps a safe distance from the group, or seeking treasure while the others are distracted. The best dungeon delvers become legends and are sought after by anyone with a particularly inaccessible treasure to recover. Some even accept regular stipends from various nobles to leave their treasures alone. Only the best dungeon delvers survive to make names for themselves, however. Those who lack the necessary ter one-half of the experience points needed for skill and savvy perish anonymously on unsuccess- advancement to the next level.
