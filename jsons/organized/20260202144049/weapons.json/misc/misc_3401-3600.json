Instead, each book 2 INTRODUCTION The old man looked up from his book as the bell above the door of his shop chimed softly announcing the entrance of a potential customer. He squinted through the accumulating gloom at a young man, well-kept and wearing the baggy robes currently in vogue for those styling themselves wizards. The aged sage snorted softly at the manicured hands and carefully trimmed beard of the lad. He had seen this sort often enough, probably knew just enough to entertain the ladies he wished to coax to his sheets. The old man muttered to himself and went, back to his reading. Curse that fool Marius, Santado thought to himself. This shrivelled old man could not possibly be the legendary Falun, tutor to half of the Red Tower mages. He just looks like a doddering old curmudgeon who would scarce know the difference between iron and apple seeds. \u0027Excuse me, sir, is there a Falun here?\u0027 Santado decided that perhaps the old man was Falun\u0027s father and might know his whereabouts. The old man blinked, \u0027Falun? Not heard that name in many years, who wants to know?\u0027 \u0027I am Santado, I was told that this Falun fellow could show me the Dark Road.\u0027 Santado smiled hopefully. The old man squinted over the jumble of vials and twists of herb-filled parchment scattered on the counter before him, \u0027Well, I\u0027m Falun, for that part of your question, but the Dark Road? Never heard of it.\u0027 Something in the way the old man chewed at his wispy moustache named him a liar. His young customer pressed further for the information he sought. \u0027It was intimated you were a guide to those seeking to travel such a path. Perhaps there is one who knows more that I have mistaken you for . . .\u0027 The old sage straightened to his full height, \u0027There is none more knowledgeable than me in any matters magical. Any who says otherwise is a liar.\u0027 The young man changed his approach, \u0027If it is a matter of money, I\u0027ve more than enough gold to pay for my instruction. Name your price.\u0027 Falun rolled his eyes, \u0027Listen, boy, you couldn\u0027t haggle your way out of an open sack and you\u0027re as subtle as a goat with gas. What makes you think you\u0027d be able to bargain with a fiend?\u0027 T made no mention of fiends. Perhaps I speak with the correct person after all.\u0027 The old man bristled and grumbled to himself, \u0027Shifty little bastard got you there you old codger. Mayhap you\u0027re getting too old for this.\u0027 The frowning sage glared at his customer and shook his head. \u0027I can show you the Dark Road, boy, but the work and the danger will be yours alone.\u0027 DEMONOLOGY - AN OVERVIEW DEMONOLOGY— demonologists are, however, prone to focus upon their studies to the exclusion of all else, unaware of I the damage they may be doing to the world around AN OVERVIEW them and just how far down the Dark Road they mayj have travelled. This is the cold, black precipice all practitioners of the art must stare in the face each T here are many misconceptions surrounding and every day of their lives. the active practising of demonology. It is often called the Dark Road, the Forbidden It is often said the practice of demonology will Path or the Black Art. It immediately conjures up eventually corrupt anyone, no matter how strong images of blood-soaked rituals, of the sacrifice of they were before they started on the Dark Road.

It is I him from the nearest tree. There is much here the trap is laid. Virtually any wizard has the misunderstood of the people who choose to tread the strength and ability to summon the lesser creatures Dark Road. of the infernal planes. All it takes is access to the required knowledge. Such a wizard may call forth a Demonology, in and of itself, is not evil. A wizard nightmare to carry him a great distance with all who chooses to supplement his arcane powers with speed in order to deliver a vital message. He may the demonic is not necessarily a twisted individual, summon a small pack of hell hounds so as to aid in ; greedy and selfish, utterly consumed by his quest for the defence of a lonely village from a marauding knowledge. In all likelihood he does not, in fact, tribe of hobgoblins. There is no harm and little offer up dark prayers to the gods of evil whenever he danger in this, so long as all the required uses his magical powers. Like much in the world, prerequisites of the summoning are followed and demonology is merely a tool, no more, no less. A obeyed. But as the wizard progresses along the powerful and potentially dangerous tool, to be sure, Dark Road, he gains far deeper and blacker but there is no more inherent evil in the art than in knowledge, becoming a demonologist proper.

He will hordes of darkness but it may also be turned against become far more capable and when he pulls a being the innocent at the desire of its wielder. So it is with from the infernal planes, the demonologist will find demonology. he can reach the most powerful and malevolent of creatures. Being so close to such power is a draw to many and they may find themselves performing acts When one serves good, to hold back from using any during summonations that once they may have tool available is dereliction to the point of the found repugnant. It is a relatively simple step to affirmation of evil. using the bones of those long gone in order to summon certain species of demon.

No Magic Circle can be used in a summoning immense dangers on a regular basis for questionable ritual to protect the demonologist as he calls upon gains. There is a strong belief amongst most the great powers of the infernal planes. All he has wizards that demonology is only for the most to protect him from the ravages of these evil foolish who lack the will and discipline to engage in creatures is his own force of will and his long years of study in the purer forms of magic. meticulously researched knowledge. Many fall by the wayside as they walk the Dark Road but those Even the most dedicated of demonologists know whose footing remains true can gain access to there are far safer methods in consorting with the demonic energies that far outstrip those of any beings of the infernal planes and bargaining for their mortal. services. The combined effects of Planar Binding and Magic Circle spells are the most well known The Summoning of Demons is more than mere and, indeed, offer far greater flexibility in the knowledge. It is a slippery path to hell which is all creatures called to the material world than does the too often paved by a wizard\u0027s own good intentions. demonological art. Relatively simple Summon Monster spells have the ability to call forth the Old adage from the School of Magic lesser demonic creatures and completely subject OF DEMONS, DEVILS them to the wizard\u0027s demands through the act of conjuration. AND FIENDS Demonology has its own purpose, though. It Demonology is, in its purest form, the practice of balances risk with the possibility of gaining power summoning, controlling and perhaps binding the much quicker than through either of the methods presented above. To summon and control even a dretch or imp using Planar Binding spells requires a very powerful wizard and few attain such levels of magical ability. Summon Monster spells offer a slightly quicker path but are severely limited when compared to demonology in terms of what the creature can be called upon to do, how long it remains in the material world and, indeed, the range of creatures that can be summoned. The Dark Road offers the demonologist several advantages over arcane wizardry, just as the major schools of magic offer benefits to those who specialise in their teachings. Whilst demonology limits itself purely to the summonation and control of beings of the infernal planes, it will potentially allow a practitioner to call upon the power of any of the millions that inhabit those foul places. A summoned demon will likely be under the practitioner\u0027s control for far longer than with the simple Summon Monster spells and can be compelled to perform a far greater range of actions. Many practitioners, however, are drawn to the practice of demonology for the most basic reason of all - the Dark Road offers the promise of far greater power over a far shorter period of time than arcane magic can ever grant. The counterbalance to this, and the reason most wizards distance themselves far from the practice, are the greatly magnified 5 DEMONOLOGY - AN OVERVIEW immortal creatures of the infernal planes. Many is the definition we shall use throughout this book. such planes of existence are present for Any mention of demons applies equally to devils demonologists to tap and the inhabitants of these and other fiends. hellish worlds vary accordingly.

This was the first time he had seen the old man in nearly a year. He had been too busy poring over the texts that Falun had sold him at their initial meeting and searching for more. The old sage shrugged his stooped shoulders, \u0027I never thought the risk was worth the gain.\u0027 The young man blinked. \u0027How can you say that?\u0027 Falun sighed, \u0027No matter which particular path on the Dark Road one chooses to follow, there is the very real possibility that something will go horribly wrong or one will find one\u0027s self committing acts that would make an eternity of the blackest torture imaginable to man seem like a spring festival.\u0027 The old sage shook his head, \u0027I value my life and my soul too much to stain either with the actions required of a practising demonologist.\u0027 \u0027But you would show others down the path you fear to tread?\u0027 Falun smiled enigmatically, \u0027That is their choice, not mine.\u0027 6 TO TREAD THE DARK ROAD To TREAD THE evil in the first place. The ends may not always justify the means. DARK ROAD Finally we come to those that most civilised peoples would call the archetypal demonologist. Cruel, twisted and utterly evil to the core, either from birth T o say it requires a rather special and unique or from having been exposed too much to the individual to study demonology is something creatures of the infernal planes, these practitioners of an understatement. Practitioners are follow the Dark Road as a means of ultimate power. marked by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, Hungry and rapacious individuals, these often in many areas of expertise. Most tend to be demonologists are heedless of the pain and suffering highly skilled in the practice and application of they cause, interested only in crushing any who arcane magic.

Such goals may able to withstand the rigours and temptations their be the domination of a kingdom, the subservience of chosen art forces upon their minds. an entire race or a quest for immortality. Who can truly say what motivates such men? A SIMPLE CHOICE THE PRACTITIONERS What is often more interesting to study, however, are the reasons why an individual chooses to The art of demonology actually comprises several practice the summoning of dark and evil powers. disciplines, each specialised and focussed. The Despite all the tales told by adventurers in taverns most common is the demonologist, a wizard of and parents to their children at night, not all Arcane Lore who chooses to supplement his power demonologists are evil and twisted beings who through the actual summonation of creatures from engage in foul practices within lonely towers in the the infernal planes.

Some may even trivialise the art and unwary is beyond dispute. It must be said, by using their power to alleviate nights of boredom though, that the vast majority of those who start through the summoning of a succubus. upon the Dark Road are neutral in character and care little for the eternal struggle between good and Wizards skilled in the crafting of the finest magical evil.

Pentagrams and their uses As with the study of demonology itself, there are many misconceptions based around pentagrams and their use within magical labours. It is a common belief, for example, that a pentagram exists to protect the wizard from malevolent spirits that he calls upon for boon and aid. There are some fields of magic, witchcraft being the most prevalent, where this holds true but for demonology the pentagram serves a much different purpose. To pull a being of any power from the distant infernal planes and make it manifest in the material world takes a tremendous amount of magical energy, the type of which few mortals are able to withstand let alone manipulate to their own ends. The pentagram used in demonology is, quite simply, a carefully constructed magical focus designed to channel and magnify a practitioner\u0027s own forces in order to build enough power during the summoning ritual to call a demon into the material world. By focussing this much energy over a relatively short period of time, the power inherent within a correctly drawn pentagram is completely expended when the summoning ritual is complete, leaving the practitioner with no protection against the creature he has just summoned other than his own knowledge and force of personality. The correct drawing of a pentagram during the summoning ritual is of utmost importance if the attempt is to be successful and the margin for error is incredibly small. Even a single human hair lying across a critical juncture of the pentagram can be enough to dissolve its power and decrease its potency, thus placing a far greater burden on the summoner who may instead benefit from saving his strength for controlling the demon rather than just summoning it. In this way, a badly drawn pentagram can have a marked effect upon the controlling process even though its power has been expended during the summoning. A demonologist cannot, of course, cast any spell or activate any magical item whilst performing either the summoning or the controlling process. He must rely purely on his demonological capabilities during these critical times. 17 THE ART OF SUMMONING - FIRST STEPS Study and Preparation demonologist will be granted a +2 bonus to both his Demonology is not an art that can be easily Summoning and Control checks. mastered by those short of memory or failing in their mental faculties.

Having studied an ancient scroll for the past five days and passing her Demon Lore check, she feels reasonably confident that she can now summon a dretch, one of the lesser Tana\u0027ri. Being her first attempt in the art, Fallora makes sure she will be undisturbed during the summoning ritual and takes her time, gaining the +2 Slow Ritual bonus to both her Summoning and Control checks. She also locates fine quality copper powder, the component needed to draw the pentagram for dretches, adding a further +1 bonus to the Summoning check. Taking four hours to perform the ritual, as she is making sure no mistakes enter her preparations, Fallora attempts to call a dretch from the infernal planes into the pentagram. A dretch has CR 2, so the check becomes DC 12. However, Fallora is a first level demonologist (+1), has an Intelligence of 15 (+2), is using high quality components (+1) and is taking her time (+2), giving a total bonus of+6, meaning only a 6 needs to be rolled. Unsurprisingly, she manages to call the dretch to the material world. Now comes the tricky bit. Incensed at being pulled from the infernal planes, the dretch would clearly like to exact revenge upon Fallora. Clearing her mind of the telepathic threats the dretch is hurling at her, Fallora attempts to control the demon. The Control check is DC 14 as the dretch\u0027s CR is doubled for this check. Fallora\u0027s Charisma of 11 adds no bonus, but being a first level demonologist helps (+1), as does her Slow Ritual (+2), meaning she has to roll 11 or more. With a breath of relief, she succeeds and gives the dretch a very simple instruction - \u0027protect me from all harm.\u0027 The dretch will now effectively act as her bodyguard for the next hour but Fallora, overjoyed at her success, wants more. She exerts her will to force the dretch to follow this instruction for another hour. There is a -2 penalty to this next Control check as it counts as being an additional instruction, so Fallora needs to roll a 13. She succeeds in this too and decides she can try for a third hour. The cumulative penalty for another additional instruction rises to -4, thus requiring a roll of 15 this time around. Unfortunately Fallora fails and the dretch breaks free of the magical bonds she placed around it. Fallora is about to learn even a dretch can be a very dangerous enemy when free. . . Anything may be demanded and the demon is every other part of this practice, there are rules that compelled to carry out such instructions to the best must be obeyed. of its ability.

All demons of this stature will also have a small number, no more than half a dozen, of greater names. These names have actual power over the demon and are thus carefully guarded by their owner.

Demons use this calling only in very rare circumstances for to do so leaves them in debt and they can always expect to make repayment sometime in the future.

This is usually done either to cause the maximum amount of harm to the mortal who dared to summon them or to stay within the material world for protracted periods of time in order to fulfil their own malevolent plans outside of the infernal planes. Accomplished demonologists can also force the possession of other mortals as a means to trap the demon in the material world for longer than the summoning ritual might ordinarily allow. The subject of possession will lose all control of his body, though he remains conscious and aware. The demon takes control of his body utterly and the victim can do nothing more than watch mutely as the demon performs the most vile and hideous of acts in his name. Physical changes also take place, with the body straining to take the shape of both mortal and demon simultaneously.

Possession in Action Fallora has progressed quite far in the field of demonology since we last left her. She has now achieved 4th level as a demonologist and feels ready to summon the succubus known as the Debaucheress, using research material she uncovered from the notes of an evil wizard she and her adventuring comrades recently put an end to. Everything seems to be going fine in the summoning ritual for Fallora, as always, is taking her time, using high quality components and generally doing everything she can to make sure nothing goes wrong. She easily summons the succubus but as it appears in the pentagram in front if her, the unthinkable happens - Fallora\u0027s player rolls a 1 for the Control check. Grinning with the lovely maliciousness only a succubus can muster, the Debaucheress advances forward across the boundaries of the pentagram. Fearing for her life, Fallora begins to cast an offensive spell until she realises that the demon is not attacking her directly - it is assaulting her very mind. Fallora\u0027s Wisdom of 12 will help here as her Will Save bonus is now +5. The DC of the save is 10 + the succubus\u0027 CR 9. It is a tough roll, needing 14 or more and, rolling 11, Fallora quickly succumbs to the Debaucheress\u0027 mental attack though it will only be able to control her for one hour. She is now possessed and falls under the control of the Games Master until one hour has passed and the succubus returns to the infernal planes. Fallora, as the host for the succubus, immediately gains all the demon\u0027s skills and saving throw bonuses, as well as all its special abilities, such as energy drain, alternate form and tongues. In addition, their ability scores must be averaged out between them. Fallora\u0027s scores are Str 8, Dex 13, Con 9, Int 15, Wis 12, Cha 11. The succubus\u0027 scores are Str 13, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 20. The new scores for Fallora, averaged between her original abilities and those of the succubus are therefore Str 10, Dex 13, Con 11, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 15. Her hit points of 12 are also averaged with those of the succubus\u0027 of 33 to result in 22 hit points. Last of all, much to Fallora\u0027s consternation, she becomes physically more demonic! She starts to grow small bat-like wings and her eyes begin to glow with a sinister light. Fortunately for Fallora, the possession lasts only an hour and the succubus soon departs, though not without destroying her laboratory in which it was summoned, tearing apart her demonological notes and slaughtering her familiar which did not get out of the way in time. She loses the succubus\u0027 skills and special abilities, her ability scores are returned to what they were before the possession took place and she now has one hit point left. She regains, however, full control of her own body again. The effect, brief as it was, has unfortunately not left Fallora completely untouched for she still retains the physical likeness of a succubus. She also loses one point from her Wisdom and Charisma ability scores permanently, as well as 1000 experience points. The whole affair has left Fallora questioning whether she will continue the practice of demonology at all - in the very least she is likely to be very cautious in the art for the future. She also realises, however, that the possession could have been much, much worse. Overall, she has got off lightly. 27 THE ART OF SUMMONING - THE NEOPHYTE DEMONIC FAMILIARS As they cultivate their growing knowledge of the black art, demonologists often seek to enhance all around them with the energies they learn to control. Many will look to their own familiars, if they have one. There are many minor demonic entities that flit about within the infernal planes, all but beneath the attention of the larger demons, as ants scamper unnoticed by men. Such beings may be brought into the material world by any demonologist with the intention of possessing his own familiar. Creating a Demonic Familiar Any demonologist with a familiar may choose to possess it with a minor demonic entity at any time. Doing so takes a day and uses up magical materials totalling a cost of 500 gp. Demonic familiars function in exactly the same way as mundane familiars, with the exceptions noted below. The demonic familiar retains its original form, but will begin to look distinctly demonic in nature - a cat may grow horns or vestigial wings, for example, or the eyes of an owl may begin to glow with their own inner light. The demonic presence may be driven out by a banishment spell and similar magicks. If this occurs, the familiar automatically leaves the demonologist, as it will never trust its master again. Treat this as if the familiar had died. Familiar special abilities are granted as normal, but a demonic familiar will also gain the abilities listed below; Master Class Level Special Ability 1-2 Immune to fire and poison 3-4 See in Darkness (including magical) 5-6 Invisibility once a day 7-8 Cold and acid resistance 20 9-10 Master may speak telepathically with any creature who has language whenever he is in physical contact with the demonic familiar 28 THE ART OF SUMMONING - THE DARK ROAD THE ART OF power through more direct means.

As can be readily seen, even the most powerful of demons are likely to be compelled by this. Success in the Control check will result in the demon lord compelled to obey every instruction the demonologist issues for one year and a day from the time of summoning. These instructions do not have to be stated when the demon is summoned, as is usual, but instead any can be given at any time and they will automatically be obeyed. If the demon\u0027s physical form is slain whilst on the material world, it will return to the infernal planes but, unfortunately for the demonologist, the soul servitude is not nullified and after the year and a day, he will be beholden to the demon as described below.

All the demonologist can do is follow the designs of his master, hoping that by proving himself capable, he staves off the cruel attentions of the demon for as long as possible. It may be hard to imagine what a demon could possibly want from the material world, especially as it is likely to be up to its neck in the convoluted politics of the infernal planes. However, demons and other immortals have always had a peculiar interest in the affairs of those on the material world, taking great delight in influencing or destroying them with mighty, awesome power. The initial tasks set before a demonologist under soul servitude are likely to be minor, petty even, as the demon weighs up its new tool. Simply visiting pain and destruction upon those nearby may be one course. Alternatively, a more practical approach may be taken, such as seeking the death of a noble knight who has too often thwarted the plans of evil, or another demonologist who has dominated many demonic allies for far too long. Beyond this, nobles may be corrupted, entire cities subverted and kingdoms toppled as the demonologist, aided by his demonic master, is compelled to build cults and followings dedicated to causing the greatest amount 33 THE DARK ROAD of destruction possible. A demon\u0027s vision of its own ambition is truly infinite and its plans will always reflect this. Just as the demonologist begins to think he can do no more for1 his master, the demon will start to relate a new set of demands, further propelling him into becoming an enemy of all that is good and pure. There are two more things to consider. First of all, demons regularly use the souls in their possession as bargaining tokens to further their own ends upon the infernal planes, always the prime concern. Being immortal, demons do not view the passage of time in quite the same way as those on the material world and the passing of a mortal\u0027s lifetime is of little moment to such creatures. However, there remains the possibility of a demonologist suddenly finding himself beholden to a far more powerful demon then he originally bargained for as his soul gets passed on, perhaps even as far as one of the very lords of hell. If this unfortunate event ever occurs, he will suddenly be confronted with an increasingly domineering master who is likely to demand a lot more from the soul servitude. Second, one day, whether it is sooner or later, the demon will come to collect its due. After the ritual of servitude, the practitioner\u0027s soul becomes the property entire of the is purely intentional. Soul servitude must never be demon. For weeks, months or years it will tease and considered lightly and is likely to result in, at least, torment the pitiful demonologist, always reminding the retirement of the character concerned.

If he is ever distracted from the work or takes a break of a day or more, the process is ruined and all materials used will be wasted. Once the item has been successfully created, a demon must be summoned and controlled to bind it within, the binding taking place in lieu of any instructions being given to the demon. There is an additional -6 penalty to the Control check when a binding is attempted. Failure in this roll will result in the usual penalties of the demon turning upon the binder, slaying or possessing him. The materials used in creating the item will also be destroyed by this.

It is a fact of role-playing. As a last word, demonologists still progress with their spells as if they were normal wizards. However, if a practitioner is concentrating on locating demonic texts rather than new magic, his spellbook is going to be rather more empty than another wizard of the same level. We would strongly suggest that once the demonologist class has been taken, you severely restrict the character\u0027s access to spells. Allow him to fill out available spell slots but ensure he does not have the huge range arcane wizards soon build up. SUMMONING AND CONTROLLING Though the mechanics governing the summoning and control of demons are of paramount importance to a player, there is actually little a Games Master should worry 46 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS Failed Control Checks Once a Control check has been failed, the demonologist is likely to be in a great deal of trouble. He is probably not too good in close combat whilst many demons are able to give even high level fighters a serious challenge. The demon, starting within the pentagram, is considered to be within five feet of the summoning demonologist. Initiative is rolled for normally and combat begins. It is important to consider the Intelligence of the demon when it becomes uncontrolled. A demon with a low score is likely to simply wade in, trying to destroy the demonologist in the shortest time possible. More wily creatures will search for weaknesses as they fight, not attempting ploys they believe the demonologist is immune to, instead using the special qualities or attacks that will cause the maximum amount of damage. Possession will only be used if the demon has a better than even chance of overpowering the summoner - after all, he has exerted his will in trying to control the demon and so it will know just how strong his mental forces are. If the battle goes against the demon, it will flee back to the infernal planes to nurture its hatred. The penalties a demon suffers from the loss of its physical form in the material world are too severe for it to ignore. Last, if other characters are present, attacks will be distributed to those that pose the greatest physical threat. The goal, however, is the destruction of the demonologist and so the demon will seek to accomplish this before being forced back to the infernal planes, either by fleeing or having its physical form slain. about here.

EVIL OUTSIDERS The rules within this supplement concentrate primarily on summoning demons and devils, as described in the Monster Manual. However, we have also made provision for any evil outsider to be summoned in exactly the same way, nightmares and hell hounds being the two examples listed on pages 54 and 55. Something of a quandary is posed here though. It is very easy to imagine a demonologist summoning nightmares and hell hounds because they are so demonic in nature.

He had finally found all of the information and items he required to attempt this summoning. It had taken him a full seven hours to draw the pentagram and elaborate runes that now glowed slightly before him. Prior to that, there had been six months of collecting components and scouting a suitable location. These were but blinks of the eye compared to the seven years of painstaking investigation and research that had allowed Santado to set his feet on the Dark Road. He felt the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck rise as the power he controlled began to course through the carefully scribed pentagram, causing it to glow brighter. The large gold mirror in the centre of the summoning area began to glow as well. His breath fogged slightly in the pallid light, making his ancient words nearly visible as he chanted. Santado felt the Power tear at his will, trying to force itself free of the restrictions he had put on it. The luminosity of the pentagram and runes throbbed in time with his chant casting eerie shadows that brought to mind the silhouettes of hanged men on the walls of the chamber. As Santado finished his incantation a loud thunderclap echoed through the summoning chamber accompanied by a noxious cloud of thick yellow smoke. The demonologist clapped his hands bringing forth a breeze that tattered the bilious fog, clearing the air and revealing the demon he had laboured so diligently to summon. Hunched in the centre of the casting circle squatted a huge, misshapen figure. Large cloven hooves glinted dully in the waning light of the pentagram. Its powerful ursine body was matted in thick fur bristling into a shaggy ruff that covered the massive shoulders and neck. The head of the demon was that of a gargantuan boar with three sets of gleaming, razor-sharp tusks. Santado had never imagined the demon would be so huge though he had read hundreds of descriptions of the bloodthirsty nalfeshnee. The demon rested its sharp taloned paws on its knees as it looked around the chamber. \u0027What soul-bearer calls me?\u0027 The creature\u0027s voice grated against Santado\u0027s ear sounding like a combination of crumbling rock and tearing metal.

Watch your words, human.\u0027 Santado allowed himself a smug smile, \u0027True.

        "description":  " I wanted to inform you that I completely retract my objections to your assignment of these adepts to my watch. I was wrong in denouncing their physical skills and, by your grace, another six recruits would not receive a cold welcome should you choose to grant me their service. Yesterday’s battle has changed my mind about wizards entirely and I apologise for all of my harsh words in the past. When my mount was downed by a giant’s hurled stone, I was certain it heralded the end of my life. We have never been able to successfully repel a hill giant raider before and being caught out in the fields we normally have to abandon to them would have been instant death for me. The presence of my men on the wall did not offer me any comfort as the beast charged towards me, as they have only rarely been able to find purchase in the hide armour of these mammoth brutes. When its crushing shadow fell over me, I did not expect to see the sun again. I learned later that the giant had fallen on me, pierced by every arrow my command could fire and a dozen bolts of magical energy. I do not know what magic your adepts used to give my guards such uncanny accuracy but I thank the Steelbringer for them in any case. I will be making a concerted effort to bring the wizards and the guardsmen of my watch together in co-operative effort. I believe you will be seeing great things from the East Gate in the future. 66 DIVINATION - AN OVERVIEW Again, here is a letter from the prince requesting that I put all my other studies on hold and create a version of foresight that he can use and have cast on others. It would seem he would prefer to wander the countryside without an old mage as chaperone. Ah, to be young, in love and utterly stupid! Doesn’t he realise that his father does not have me chained to his princely side because my foresight can warn us of danger? It is the fact he wants to dally in town that my liege has me constantly on guard! The kingdom can ill-afford another War of the Heirs and, while I remain watchful, there will be no little princelets sired who could cause one. Besides, if I made my most valuable spell useful to anyone, the crown would no longer need me as much.

Second, divination magic a situation calls for subtlety, a diviner might wish 1100 KNOWING THE UNKNOWABLE It began as a simple mugging. Two men wearing heavy cowls followed them as they moved down the street and into the shadowed alleys of the East Ward. In hindsight, Randius considered that his first mistake. He had spotted the two thugs long before he had steered his new lady-friend into the ward but he had let his aching body dictate a shorter path over a safer one. Still, whether arrogance or the ennui of age, he simply had not felt two oafish thieves to be a threat. When the attack began, his judgement proved wrong. One of the two shimmered and disappeared from view, while the other blurred forward with a speed that could only be born of magic. Cursing himself for being a fool, he pushed Dulcaea against the nearest wall and turned to face the ‘thieves’. The one he could still see was drawing a long, curved blade of black steel. The man’s eyes, visible over a woollen scarf, were not those of a robber – they glimmered with a far darker purpose. His magic instantly warned him of the descending sword behind him. Knowing which way to dodge, his old bones creaked in protest but obeyed him, and he sidestepped the assassin’s strike. With a quick whisper and a gesture, he touched his eyes and the invisible killer was revealed to him. Only long years of practice allowed him to dodge around his assailant’s swings while his spell took effect. Unfortunately, he knew the other assassin was closing fast. He simply was not fast enough to deal with them both before they took him down. With none of his defensive spells cast, he was an easy target. The sound of steel striking steel behind him caught both of them off-guard. Glancing back, he saw the other assailant with his sword halfway through a cleaving stroke that would have shorn his grey-haired pate clean off. Randius looked again and, to his surprise, the only thing holding the stroke back was another dark metal blade, this one was in the delicate hands of Dulcaea who was, apparently, saving his life. ‘Pay attention to your own fight, old one!’ Her voice reminded him of the invisible thug he was ignoring. His spell of foresight again warned him of a heart-piercing stroke coming towards him and he reacted accordingly. The blade went past him and as the killer followed it, Randius sent him on his way with a gentle shove and a pulse of lightning from his suddenly electrified touch. The assassin flickered visibly as his bones lit up from Randius’ shocking grasp and, still twitching, he crumpled to the ground in a smouldering heap. While he took care of one killer, Dulcaea was expertly warding off the attacks of the other, long slashes making his heavy clothes gape open, their depths soaked in flowing blood. Randius focused on the thug’s mind and caught a glimpse of something… violent. ‘Dulcaea, he is about to use a wand in his sleeve!’ His voice sounded winded and reedy but at his age he was amazed he was still standing. The lady glanced up at his words, nodded grimly and parried the assassin’s sword high into the air. With a powerful downward slash that belied her slight build, Dulcaea rendered the treacherous sleeve, and the arm it contained, a moot point. With a howl of pain, the would-be slayer turned to run. Dulcaea betrayed no sign of emotion as she cut him down from behind. Randius caught his breath and looked at the two bodies on the ground, one only now becoming visible again. Dulcaea moved to his side and began looking him over. ‘You hurt? Did you get cut?’ Her tone was far more professional now than it had been in the bar, and not in the way he had been hoping. ‘No, no! I am quite fine!’ He answered tersely. In truth, the killers had come very close to accomplishing their task but he was miraculously unharmed. He stared at his saviour and frowned sourly. ‘Suppose you tell me what you really want now, since it obviously isn’t what I thought it was.’ The woman smiled again for the first time since the attack. It did not quite reach her eyes but it did not seem forced either. ‘Don’t sound so disappointed, sir. Come with me. I’ll tell you everything once we get off these streets.’ With that, she cleaned the blood from her blade and walked away into the shadows of the night. He should never have followed her. In hindsight, Randius considered that his second mistake… 1100 11 KNOWING THE UNKNOWABLE to leave the robes and spellbooks behind and adopt through the intermittent use of spells or magic a more common style of dress.

Even the Aelve could not hold so much land at once but our magical powers have grown so great that this accomplishment is practically a given within the year! Did you all really think we would go uncontested? True, we swept the Gendahr into the dust of ashen battlefields and the Rockholme will not leave their stony fortresses to challenge us for fear of what we did to Mount Elaiyne. Did you really think those battles sealed our victory? Nay, I tell you. The war may be won in your eyes but, as I see it, only the stage of conflict has changed. I grant you that we cannot be defeated by any army left on this world. Our golems can crush a hundred soldiers each and our mighty spells are a match for any legion of archers or armoured horsemen. Despite all this, do not yet sit proud on your thrones and think us untouchable! I have finally received word from the house of Dyrennis and the news is grave indeed.

You laughed when I asked that we sanction the purging of all the prisons in our lands and now, if my visions are correct, you will choke on it. Someone has emerged from one of our ‘camps’ in the conquered lands, someone with a thirst for revenge and the means to take it. You have long scoffed at my dream-visions but I tell you this, and may you remember it well when this slayer’s steel tears through your throat. This assassin bears one of the ancient blades of sightbinding, the very weapons we used to destroy the tyrant Albeyroth and seize power for ourselves. 5544 55 THE ART OF GEMSIGHT The Art of The Price of Power While quartz may be a common enough material for a crystal ball, gemstones are considerably Gemsight more expensive, and a sphere large enough to use would easily be hundreds or thousands of A s mentioned before, the single most useful carats in size.

The key to effective foretelling is to never give away so much that the adventure is compromised, while giving the characters enough valuable 5588 59 DESIGNER\u0027S NOTES Designer’s game, be wary of this. People have a way of finding other hobbies when this one becomes too painful to continue. Notes But enough depressing stuff! I promised to tell you W hen I put in the request to write this why I wrote this book. First, I saw all the other book, I was not sure there would be books coming out for my beloved gaming system. much interest in it. Yes, that is correct; Dragons, battle magic, necromancy and lots of other I volunteered to write an entire book on divination. violent, dark and brooding fare seemed to be the Why? Well, there are three reasons really. I’ll talk order of the day. Do not get me wrong; every book about why in a moment but, before I do, I want I just mentioned is excellent and serves a valuable to make a plea to Games Masters reading this. role in any gamer’s collection but I wanted to ensure Divination is a subtle art and is not well suited to that not every supplement available was centred on combat-heavy games. Please try to make a place combat and dark deeds. It can be a sad truth about for it. The nuances of motivation, foreshadowing this hobby that the lowest common denominator and imagery required to really make a diviner shine amongst us is the ‘hack and slasher’. I wanted to are exactly the same things that can make for a rich, provide another option. vibrant campaign world. Second, divination magic is interesting.

Unless that is the accepted line of your 6600 DESIGNER\u0027S NOTES It was a long time before the lady signalled to him that they were safe. She did so by putting a surprisingly strong hand on his chest and stopping him in his staggering tracks. Exhausted to the core, Randius was also just as indignant. He took a moment to compose his thoughts and regain his lost breath. Then, speaking as softly as his temper allowed, he said, ‘I am not budging an inch more until I get some answers. I’ll pull them from your mind if they don’t come from your lips.’ Dulcaea whirled on him in the shadows of the abandoned wharf house. Her sword was a streak of dark steel until it touched him under the chin. The point rested dangerously against his throat but it did not draw blood. ‘Try to enter my mind and I will bleed you myself, old man. Are we clear?’ The soft, pleasant lady he had met in the bar was completely gone, replaced with someone so cold and hard she might as well be carved of black ice. ‘All right. All right.’ He stepped back and held up his hands. ‘No thought reading here, I promise. But you nearly killed me already with that frantic run through the streets. I am not even sure where we are, and I have lived in this city my whole life.’ The woman smiled, an incongruous expression that seemed ill-suited to her right now, as she slowly lowered the sword and returned it to its scabbard. Even in the dim light, Randius noticed how similar it was to the blades of the assassins earlier. ‘Good. If I got you lost, we may have lost our pursuers. I counted six, and that would be enough to canvas quite an area. Shadowswords are hard to evade.’ Randius found an old crate and sat down. To his chagrin, his bones creaked more than the wood did. ‘Pursuers? What pursuers? I didn’t detect anyone… and what in the Hells is a ‘shadowsword’?’ He felt lost and suddenly, worse than ever before, very old. The woman looked at him for a long time, then her face inexplicably softened. Not much but it did just a little. ‘You really don’t know?’ She crossed the room to another crate and crouched on it, her hand still resting on her weapon. She looked like a hunting cat, her angular face and lithe muscles tensed and ready for danger. The old wizard sputtered and looked into her blue eyes with returning ire. ‘Of course I don’t! I have no idea why people would try to kill me! I do not have a clue what a ‘shadowsword’ is, and I don’t think I want to! Gods above and below, I don’t even know who you are! Dulcaea probably isn’t even your real name.’ He looked down, suddenly sulking. ‘I’m not sure hellcats have names.’ Surprisingly, Dulcaea’s steely resolve broke in a wide grin and a wry chuckle. ‘I am not an infernal monster, I swear. And Dulcaea is my real name.’ She laughed again and relaxed slightly. ‘Dulcaea D’seleste. And I am sorry for all this. With everything that has happened, I could not know what side of things you were really on.’ Now he felt lost again. ‘What has happened? You mean my being fired? I hardly think that…’ She cut him off with a quick shake of her head. ‘You really don’t know, do you? The king has put together a force of diviners and rogues to hold his dwindling power over the land. He means to put down insurrections before they happen and is willing to kill anyone who won’t join his order. The queen had you fired to keep you safe. If you had remained, you surely would have met with an unfortunate ‘accident’.’ Randius blinked at her, his mind racing to make sense of her words. Unfortunately, they made entirely too much sense. This explained the closed-door sessions, the late night visitors admitted to the royal chambers without consulting him first and the king’s shifting mood. He had blamed it all on the queen. Old fool! ‘If you have the stomach for it, there is more. The kingdom needs your magic, sir. Now more than ever.’ 6600 61 RULES SUMMARY Rules Summary Feat Prerequisite Aptitude (General) Intelligence or Wisdom 12+ Awareness (General) Alertness, Ability to cast Divination spells Crystal Attunement (General) Scry 1 rank, Charisma 10+.

Then Dydd W as slain, her heart wrested from her breast byThe dragon’s grasping jaws, swallowed, consumedTo sustain Ashardalon’s ebbing lifeFor a time. . . .—The Lay of Dydd More than any other creature, dragons are a symbol of all that is the D UNGEONS \u0026 D RAGONS ® game. From the savage white to the majestic gold, dragons represent the greatestperils adventurers face at any point in their careers, as wellas the greatest rewards they may hope to claim. From thetiny wyrmling at the bottom of an adventurer’s very firstdungeon to the colossal great wyrm he meets at the heightof his career, dragons are the ultimate climactic encounter:a brutal and memorable fight that will pay off in richesfrom the dragon’s hoard. Dragons are creatures of myth, often described as the first sentient race to appear on a world, with life spans thatstretch over hundreds of years. They symbolize the worlditself and embody its history, and the oldest dragons arerepositories of vast knowledge and ancient secrets. Thisaspect of dragons makes them much more than just a chal-lenging combat encounter: They are sages and oracles, fontsof wisdom and prophets of things to come. Their veryappearance can be an omen of good or ill fortune. Perhaps most important, dragons are a reminder that the action of the D\u0026D game takes place in a world of fan-tasy, wonder, and magic, a world far from mundane inevery way . Any attempt to describe them as little morethan glorified lizards with wings and breath weapons is adisservice, not only to dragons, but to the fantasy universeof D\u0026D and the wealth of legends, myths, and heroic sto-ries that place dragons in such an iconic position thatthey had to be a part of the very name of the game. Dragonsare, by their very nature, epic forces in the world. Theiractions, their schemes, even their dreams are felt through- out the world. From a wyrmling raiding herds of sheep tothe mighty Ashardalon feasting on preincarnate souls,dragons do things that matter, whether on a small localscale or in the cosmic big picture. They are the embodi-ment of fantasy itself. That, in a nutshell, is the reason for this book. Dragons are such a central part of the game that a rules referenceof this nature is an essential addition to any campaign,enhancing the excitement of draconic encounters forplayers and Dungeon Masters alike. A DM will find infor-mation here on the powers and tactics of dragons, as wellas a wealth of new feats, spells, magic items, and prestigeclasses designed to make dragon encounters more interest-ing, challenging, and unusual. In case the dragons alreadydescribed in the Monster Manual and other books are not enough, this book also presents a variety of new dragon-related monsters of all types to include in the game. Players,meanwhile, can unearth dragonslaying tactics and takeadvantage of new feats and spells, magic items, and prestigeclasses to make their characters the ultimate dragon slayers,dragon riders, or even dragon servants. Draconomicon is not just about the rules, tactics, and ecol- ogy of dragons, however. The illustrations in this book areintended to inspire a fresh sense of wonder and awe at thecreatures that make up such an important part of the D\u0026Dgame. Dragons are rapacious, arrogant, and deadly—butthey are also majestic, awesome, and magnificent. A renewedsense of the grandeur of dragons might not have as con-crete or noticeable an impact on your game as all the newrules you will find in this book, but its influence will surelybe felt around your gaming table. Let this book inspire you. Whether you use it to build new draconic adversaries and exciting dragon lairs stockedwith legendary treasure, or to build a character who ridesa silver dragon into battle against the servants of Tiamat,you are sure to find not just the rules you want, but thewonder you need to make your game more fun. Dragonsare creatures of legend, and with this book you can be apart of that legend. Retell it, relive it, reshape it in yourcharacter’s or your campaign’s image. Draconomicon will show you how.INTRODUCTION THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRAGONS In the D\u0026D game, the term “dragon” encompasses a number of different creatures, some of which bear little resemblance to the great flying creatures with breath weapons that we commonly think of as dragons. For the most part, this book concerns itself with the ten varieties of true dragon described in the Monster Manual — the five chromatic dragons (black, blue, green, red, white) and the five metallic dragons (brass, bronze, copper, gold, silver). True dragons are those creatures that become more powerfulas they grow older. A number of other true dragons are described in Chapter 4 of this book. In addition, Appendix 2: Index of Dragons providesa complete list of all true dragons that have been presented in official sources. Other creatures of the dragon type that do not advance through age categories are referred to as lesser dragons (whichshould not be taken to mean that they are necessarily less formidable than true dragons). The three kinds of lesser dragon described in the Monster Manual are the dragon turtle, the pseudodragon, and the wyvern. Chapter 4 of this book contains a number of descrip- tions of other lesser dragons, and Appendix 2 lists every lesserdragon that has been described in a D UNGEONS \u0026 D RAGONS rule- book or accessory.pqqqqrspqqqqrswealth of material, from bard’s tales and ponderous tomes alike, has been recorded about dragons. Unfortunately for adventurers planning to con- front a dragon, most of that information is wrong. The opening chapter of this book presents the truth about dragons—their types, habits, physiology, andworldview. THE DRAGON’S BODY “How can one imagine anything more magnificent than . . .  adragon, the paragon of creation?” —Bheilorveilthion, red wyrm “Nothing but a bunch of vain, glorified flying reptiles, if you ask me!” —Hatredymaes, androsphinx At first glance, a true dragon resembles a reptile. It has a muscular body, a long, thick neck, a horned or frilledhead with a toothy mouth, and a sinuous tail. The crea-ture walks on four powerful legs with clawed feet, and itflies using its vast, batlike wings. Heavy scales cover adragon from the tip of its tail to end of its snout. Asyou’ll see from the details to come, however, that firstglance doesn’t begin to tell the whole story about thenature of dragons.EXTERNAL ANATOMY Despite its scales and wings, a dragon’s body has fea-tures that seem more feline than reptilian. Refer tothe illustrations on the next few pages as you read on. Like a cat’s eye, a dragon’s eye has a comparatively large iris with a vertical pupil. This arrangementallows the pupil to open extremely wide and admitmuch more light than a human eye can. The sclera, or “white,” of a dragon’s eye is often yellow, gold, green, orange, red, or silver, with aniris of a darker, contrasting color. To a casual observer, a dragon’s pupils always look like vertical slits. If one were to look veryclosely into a dragon’s eye, however, one couldsee a second iris and pupil within the first. Thedragon can shift and rotate this inner apertureup to 90 degrees, so that the inner pupil canoverlay the outer one or lie at a right angle to it.This ocular structure gives a dragon extremelyaccurate depth perception and focusing abil-ity no matter how much or how little light isavailable. A dragon’s eye is protected by a leathery outer eyelid and three smooth inner eyelids, ornicti tating membranes. The innermost mem- brane is cr ystal clear and serves to protect the eye from damage while the dragon flies, 5 Illus. by L. Grant-W est6fights, swims, or burrows with its eyes open. The other two eyelids mainly serve to keep the inner membrane and thesurface of the eye clean. They are thicker than the inner-most membrane and less clear. A dragon can use theseinner lids to protect its eyes from sudden flashes of brightlight. A dragon’s eyes glow in the dark, but the dragon canhide the glow by closing one or more of its inner eyelids;doing this does not affect its vision. A dragon’s ears often prove indistinguishable from the frills that frame its head, especially when the dragon is atrest. The ears of an an active dragon, however, constantlytwitch and swivel as the dragon tracks sounds. Not all dragons have external ears; bur- rowing and aquatic dragons usu-ally have simple ear holesprotected by an overhang-ing fringe. A dragon’s mouth features powerfuljaws, a forkedtongue, and sharp teeth. The exact num- ber and size of a dragon’s teeth depend on the dragon’s age,habitat, and diet; however, a dragon’s array of teeth usuallyincludes four well-developed fangs (two upper, two lower)that curve slightly inward and have cutting edges on boththe inner and outer surfaces. A dragon uses its fangs toimpale and kill prey, and they serve as the dragon’s pri-mary weapons. Immediately in front of the fangs in each jaw lie the dragon’s incisors, which are oval in cross-section and haveserrated edges at the top. When a dragon bites down onlarge prey, these teeth cut out a semicircle of flesh. Behind the fangs in each jaw, a dragon has a row of peglike molars that help it grip prey . A dragon is not well equippedfor chewing, and it typically tears prey into chunks smallenough to gulp down. A dragon can create a sawing motionwith its incisors by wiggling its lower jaw and shaking itshead from side to side, allowing the incisors to quickly shearthrough flesh and bone. Many dragons learn to seize prey and literally shake it todeath. Other dragons have mastered the technique of grab- bing prey and swallowing it whole. Some dragon hunters boast that they can hold a dragon’s mouth closed, preventing the creature from biting. It is truethat a dragon applies more force when closing its jaws thanit does when opening them; however, holding a dragon’smouth closed still requires prodigious strength. Even if anfoe were to succeed in clamping its jaws shut, the dragon islikely to throw off the opponent with one flick of its head,claw its attacker to ribbons, or both. The spines, frills, and other pr ojections that adorn a dragon’s head make the creature look fearsome, and that is their main function. A dragon’s horn is a keratinous projection growing directly from the dragon’s skull. A dragon with horns that point backward can use the horns for grooming, and they also help protect the dragon’s upper neck in combat. Horns projecting from the sides of a dragon’s head help protect the head. A dragon’s spines are keratinous, but softer and more flexible than its horns. The spines are imbedded in the dragon’s skin and anchored to the skeleton by ligaments. Most spines are located along the dragon’s back and tail. Unlike horns, spines are mobile, with a range of motion that varies with the kind of dragon and the spines’ location on the drag- on’s body . The spines along a dragon’s back, for example, can only be raised or lowered, whereas the spines supporting a dragon’s ears can be moved manydifferent ways. The frills on a dragon’s back and tail help keep the dragon stable when flying or swimming. To a scholar who knows something about the natural world, a dragon’s powerful legs are decidedly nonreptilian,despite their scaly coverings. A dragon’s legs are positionedmore or less directly under its body, in the manner of mam-mals. (Most reptiles’ legs tend to splay out to the sides, offer-ing much less support and mobility than a dragon ormammal enjoys.) A dragon’s four feet resemble those of a great bird. Each foot has three or four clawed toes facing forward (thenumber varies, even among dragons of the same kind), plusan additional toe, also with a claw, set farther back on thefoot and facing slightly inward toward the dragon’s body,like a human’s thumb. Although a dragon’s front feet are not truly prehensile, a dragon can grasp objects with its front feet, provided theyare not too small. This grip is not precise enough for tooluse, writing, or wielding a weapon, but a dragon can holdand carry objects. A dragon also is capable of wieldingmagical devices, such as wands, and can complete somaticCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodcomponents required for the spells it can cast (see Spell- casting, below). Some dragons are adroit enough to seize prey in their front claws and carry it aloft. A dragon can use the “thumbs” on its rear feet to grasp as well, but the grip is less precise than that of the front feet. A dragon’s skin resembles crocodile hide—tough, leath- ery . and thick. Unlike a crocodile, however, a dragon hashundreds of hard, durable scales covering its body . Adragon’s scales are keratinous, like its spines. Unlike thespines, however, a dragon’s scales are not attached to itsskeleton, and the dragon cannot make them move. Thescales are much harder and less flexible than the spines,with a resistance to blows that exceeds that of steel. A dragon’s largest scales are attached to its hide along one edge and overlap their neighbors like shingles on aroof or the articulated plates in a suit of armor. These scalescover the dragon’s neck, underbelly, toes, and tail. As thedragon moves its body, the scales tend to shift as the skinand muscle under them moves, and the scales’ free endssometimes rise up slightly . This phenomenon has led someobservers to mistakenly conclude that a dragon can raiseand lower its scales in the same manner as a bird fluffingits feathers. The majority of a dragon’s scales are smaller and attached to the skin near their centers. These scales interlock withneighboring scales, giving the surface of the body a pebblytexture. The scales are large enough to forma continuous layer of natural armorover the body even when itstretches or bulges to itsgreatest extent. Whenthe body relaxes orcontracts, the skinunder the scalestends to fold andwrinkle, though theinterlocking scalesgive the body a fairlysmooth look. A dragon’s scales grow throughoutits lifetime, albeitvery slowly . Unlikemost other scaled crea-tures, a dragon neither shedsits skin nor sheds individual scales.Instead, its individual scales grow larger, and italso grows new scales as its body gets bigger. Over the years,a scale may weather and crack near the edges, but its slowgrowth usually proves sufficient to replace any portion thatbreaks off. Dragons occasionally lose scales, especially ifthey become badly damaged. Old scales often litter thefloors of long-occupied dragon lairs. When a dragon loses a scale, it usually grows a new one in its place. The new scale tends to be smaller than its neigh-bors and usually thinner and weaker as well. This phenom-enon is what gives rise to bards’ tales about chinks in adragon’s armor. These tales are true as far as they go, but onenew scale on a dragon’s massive body seldom leaves the dragon particularly vulnerable to attack. A dragon’s long, muscular tail serves mainly as a rudder in flight. A dragon also uses its tail for propulsion whenswimming, and as a weapon. A dragon’s wings consist of a membrane of scaleless hide stretched over a framework of strong but lightweight bones.Immensely powerful muscles in the dragon’s chest providepower for flight. Most dragons have wings that resemble bat wings, with a relatively short supporting alar limb, ending in a vestigialclaw that juts forward. Most of the wing area comes froma membrane stretched over elongated “fingers” of bone(the alar phalanges; see Skeleton, below), which stretchfar beyond the alar limb. Some kinds of dragons have wings that run the lengths of their bodies, something like the “wings” of manta rays. Thissort of wing also has an alar limb with phalanges supportingthe forward third of the wing, but the remainder of the wingis supported by modified frill spines that have only a limitedrange of motion and muscular control. Inside the Dragon’s Eye Most scholars remain unaware of how complex and unusuala dragon’s eye really is. In addition to its four layers of eye-lids and its double pupil, a dragon’s eye also has a double lens. The outer lens (1) is much the same as any other creature’s in form and func tion. The inner lens (2), however, is a mass of transparent muscle fibers that can polarize incoming light. The inner lens also serves to magnify what the dragon sees, and helps account for the drag- on’s superior long- distance vision. A dragon’s ret- inas (3) are packed with receptors for both color and black-and-white vision. Behind the retina lies the tapetum lucidum (4), a reflective layer that helps the dragon see in dim light. A dragon literally sees light twice, once when it strikes the retina and again when it is reflected back. It is the tapetum lucidum that makes a dragon’s eyes seem to glow in the dark. INTERNAL ANATOMY As you’ll see from the following section, a dragon’s resem-blance to a reptile is literally only skin deep. Refer to theaccompanying illustrations as you read on. Skeleton Although complete dragon skeletons are hard to come by,most scholars agree that a little more than 500 bones com-prise a dragon’s skeleton, compared to slightly more than 7CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS ➊ ➋➌ ➍8200 bones in a human skeleton. The bones in a dragon’s wings and spine account for most of the difference. Dragon bones are immensely strong, yet exceptionally light.In cross-section they lookhollow, with thick walls madeup of concentric circles ofsmall chambers staggered likebrickwork. Layers of sturdyconnective tissue and bloodvessels run between the layers. The accompanying diagram shows a dragon skeleton in detail.Significant parts of the skeleton arebriefly discussed below. The keel, or sternum (1), serves as an anchor for the dragon’s flight mus- cles. The scapula draconis (2) supportsthe wing. The metacarpis draconis (3)and alar phalanges (4) in each wing sup-port most of the wing’s flight surface. Insome dragons, the ulna draconic(5) has an extension called thealar olecranon (6) that lendsextra support to the wing. The thirteenth cervical vertebra (7) marks the baseof a dragon’s neck. Every truedragon, no matter how largeor small, has exactly 13cervical vertebrae, 12thoracic vertebrae, 7lumbar vertebrae, and36 caudal vertebrae. Major Internal Organs The insides of a dragon have several note-worthy features, all of which contribute tothe dragon’s unique capabilities. A dragon’s eyes (1) are slightly larger than they appear from the outside. The bulk of theeye remains buried inside the skull, with onlya small portion of the whole exposed whena dragon opens its eyes. Theeye’s extra size helps improvethe dragon’s ability to see at a distance.The eye’s spherical shape allows the dragon to move the eyethrough a wide arc, helping to expand its field of vision. A dragon’s brain (2) is exceptionally large, even for such a big creature, and it continues to grow as the dragon grows.It has highly developed sensory centers with specializedlobes that connect directly to the eyes, ears, and nasal pas-sages. The brain also has large areas dedicated to memoryand reasoning. The larynx (3) contains numerous well-developed vocal folds that give a dragon tremendous control over the toneand pitch of its voice. A dragon’s voice can be as shrill as acrow’s or as deep as a giant’s. Some scholars, noting that theDraconic language (see page 28) contains many harsh sounds and sibilants, conclude that a dragon’s vocal capacity is lim-ited, but this is not so. Dragons speak a strident language because it suits them to do so. The trachea (4) connects the larynx to the lungs. It is the dragon’s conduit for respiration and also for its breath weapon. A dragon’s vast lungs (5) fill much of its chest cavity . The lung structure resembles that of an avian, which can extract oxygen both on inhalation and exha- lation. In addition to being the organs for respiration, a dragon’s breath weapon is generated in its lungs from secretions produced by the draconis fundamentum (see below). A dragon’s mighty heart (6) has four chambers, just like a mammal’s heart. The draconis fundamentum (7) is a gland possessed only by true dragons. Attached to the heart, it is the center of ele- mental activity inside the dragon’s body . All blood flowing from the heart passes through this organ before going to the body . The draconis fundamentum charges the lungs with power for a dragon’s breath weapon and also plays a major role in the dragon’s highly efficient metabolism, which con- verts the vast majority of whatever the creature consumes into usable energy . Blood vessels, nerves, and ducts run directly from the draconis fundamentum to the dragon’s flight muscles, charging them with enormous energy, and also to the lungs and the gizzard. A dragon digests its food through a combina- tion of powerful muscular action and elemental force. The interior of the gizzard (8) is lined with bony plates that grind up chunks of food, and the entire organ is charged with the same elemental energy that the dragon uses for its breath weapon. Musculature Intact dragon carcasses are even more rare than intact dragonskeletons, making any catalog of a dragon’s muscles unreliableat best. Given the number of bones in a dragon skeleton, how-ever, a dragon’s muscles must number in the thousands. Overall, a dragon’s musculature resembles that of a great cat, but with much larger muscles in the chest, neck, andtail. The illustration on page 10 identifies the majormuscle groups in a dragon’s body .CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwood ➊➋➌➌➌ ➌ ➎ ➏ ➐➍ ➍ ➍ ➍Of most interest to scholars are the muscles involved in flight. These muscles can exert tremendous force and con-sume equally tremendous amounts of energy (which the dra-conis fundamentum supplies). The flight muscles are locatedin the chest and in the wings themselves. The alar pectoral(1) is the main flight muscle and is used on the wing’s down-stroke. The alar lattisimus dorsai (2) draws the wing up andback. The alar deltoid (3) and alar cleidomastoid (4) draw thewings up and forward. The muscles of the wings serve mainly to control the wing’s shape, which in turn helps the dragon maneuver inthe air. The alar tricep (5) and alar bicep (6) fold and unfoldthe wings. The alar carpi ulnaris (7) and alar carpi radialus(8) allow the wings to warp and twist. DRAGON PHYSIOLOGY “Dragons are scaly, they lay eggs, and they are utterly lacking in anymammalian characteristics. The notion that they are warm-blooded is silly.” —Aloysius Egon Greegier, armchair dragon scholar “Just like a humanoid to quote three facts, get one of them wrong, and then draw an unrelated conclusion from the lot.” —Kacdaninymila, young adult gold dragon, upon reading Greegier’s statementScholars disagree on some key aspects of dragon life, but dragons themselves have few doubts. METABOLISM Laypeople, and some scholars, are fond of the terms “cold-blooded” and “warm-blooded” to describe ectothermic andendothermic creatures, respectively . An ectothermic creature lacks the ability to produce its own heat and must depend on its environment for warmth.Most ectothermic creatures seldom actually have coldblood, because they are able to find environmental heat towarm their bodies. An endothermic creature doesn’t necessarily have warm blood. What it has is a body temperature that remainsmore or less steady no matter how hot or cold its surround-ings become. All true dragons are endothermic. Given their elemental nature, they could hardly be otherwise. A dragon’s body tem-perature depends on its kind and sometimes on its age. Drag-ons that use fire have the highest body temperatures, anddragons that use cold have the lowest. Acid- and electricity-using dragons have body temperatures that fall between thetwo extremes, with acid-users tending to have cooler bodiesthan electricity-users. Fire-using dragons literally becomehotter with age. Likewise, cold-using dragons become colderas they age. Acid- and electricity-using dragons have about 9CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by M. Nelson➊➋ ➌ ➍ ➎ ➏➐➑10 the same body temperature throughout their lives, withyounger and smaller dragonshaving slightly higher tem-peratures than older andlarger ones. Unlike most endothermic creatures, dragons have noobvious way to shed excessbody heat. They do not sweat,nor do they pant. Instead, thedraconis fundamentum extractsheat from the bloodstream andstores the energy . In a sense, then, adragon can be considered ectother-mic (because it can use environmen-tal heat). However, when a dragon isdeprived of an external heat source, itsmetabolism and activity level do notchange. Unlike a truly ectothermic creature,a dragon can generate its ownbody heat and is not slowed orforced into hibernation byexposure to cold. DIET Dragons are carnivoresand top predators,though in practicethey are omnivo-rous and eat almostanything if necessary . A dragon canliterally eat rock or dirt and survive.Some dragons, particularly the metal-lic ones, subsist primarily on inorganicfare. Such dining habits, however, are cul-tural in origin. Unfortunately for a dragon’s neighbors, the difference between how much a dragonmust eat and how much it is able to eat isvast. Most dragons can easilyconsume half their ownweight in meat every day, and manygladly do so if sufficient prey is available. Even after habit-ual gorging, a dragon seldom gets fat. Instead, it converts itsfood into elemental energy and stores it for later use. Muchof this stored energy is expended on breath weapons and onthe numerous growth spurts (see below) that a dragon expe-riences throughout its life. DRAGON LIFE CYCLE “From the tiny egg the great wyrm grows.” —Kobold proverb Barring some misfortune, a dragon can expect to live in good health for 1,200 years, possibly even a great deal longer,depending on its general fitness. All dragons, however, startout as humble eggs and progress through twelve distinct life stages, each marked by new developments in the dragon’s body, mind, or behavior. EGGS Dragon eggs vary in size depending on the kind of dragon. They are generally the same color as the dragon that laid them and the have the same energy immunities as the dragon that laid them (for example, black dragon eggs are black or dark gray and impervi- ous to acid). A dragon egg has an elongated ovoid shape and a hard, stony shell. A female dragon can produce eggs beginning at her young adult stage and remains fer- tile though the very old stage. Males are capable of fertilizing eggs beginning at the young adult stage and remain fertile through the wyrm stage. The eggs are fertilized inside the female’s body and are ready for laying about a quarter of the way through the incubation period, as shown on the table below. The numbers given on the table are approximate; actual periods can vary by as much as 10 days either way . Laying Dragon Eggs Dragon eggs are laid in clutches of two to five as often as once a year. Ovula- tion begins with mating, and a female dragon can pro- duce eggs much less often, if she wishes, simply by notCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwood",

These penalties disappear after an hour.The wyrmling otherwise has all the abilities noted for wyrm- lings of its kind in the Monster Manual, including skills and feats. Its selection of skills and feats is similar to that of its parents.pqqqqrspqqqqrsYOUNG (AGE 16-25 YEARS) By age 16, most dragons begin a new growth spurt that eventually carries them to their adult size—though theystill retain a wyrmling’s overlarge head and feet. Their intel-lects become sharper as they gain life experience and mastertheir innate abilities. At this stage, a dragon begins to feel the urge to collect trea- sure and to establish a territory (though it might well havedone both sooner). In some cases, however, a young dragoncontinues to share its lair and its territory with nestmatesor parents. Dragons that leave the nest when they becomeyoung often range far from their home lairs, seeking localeswhere they can set up housekeeping on their own. JUVENILE (AGE 26-50 YEARS) By age 26, a dragon is well on its way to adulthood. It hasnowhere near the physical power of an adult, but it has anadult’s body proportions. Some species exhibit the first oftheir magical powers at this stage. YOUNG ADULT (AGE 51-100 YEARS) As it passes the half-century mark, a dragon enters adulthood(although its body keeps growing for many more years). It isready to mate, and most dragons lose no time in doing so. By this age, a dragon’s scales have developed into armor formidable enough to turn aside all but magic weaponry orthe teeth and claws of other dragons. A young adult dragonalso masters its first spells and shows evidence of a formi-dable intellect. A young adult dragon severs its ties with nestmates, men- tors, and parents (if it has not done so already) and estab-lishes it own lair and territory .

        "description":  "HOVER AND WINGOVER Hovering is a move action, which means a dragon also can use its breath weapon, cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, ormake a melee attack while hovering (but not with a wing or its tail). If a dragon does not attack during a round when it hovers, it can instead move at half speed it any direction it likes, includ- ing straight up, straight down, or backward, no matter what its maneuverability rating is. When a dragon stops hovering, it can turn in place and resume ordinary flight in any direction in which it could normally fly. For example, if a dragon were flying north when itstopped to hover, it could turn around and fly south afterward.It still could not fly straight up or down or fly in any other manner that its maneuverability rating does not allow. A dragon can perform a wingover as a free action while flying. Performing a wingover consumes 10 feet of flying move- ment. A dragon cannot hover or gain altitude in the same round that it performs a wingover. pqqqqrspqqqqrs18 SCENT A dragon’s sense of smell is nearly as well developed as its vision. This refined sense of smell is only partly dependenton the dragon’s sensitive nose; it also uses its forked tongueto sample the air, just as a snake does. A dragon’s ability tosense the presence of other creatures by scent makes it dif-ficult to catch a dragon unawares, and hiding from a dragonis nearly impossible once a dragon is close enough to pickup the quarry’s scent. HEARING A dragon’s ears are about as sensitive as human ears, and therange of tones a dragon can hear is similar to what a humancan hear. Even the youngest of dragons, however, has sharperhearing than a typical human, thanks to its ability to recog-nize important sounds for what they are and to filter outbackground noise and focus on significant sounds. BLINDSENSE One outstanding example of a dragon’s sensory prowess isits blindsense—the ability to “see” things that are invisi-ble or completely obscured. By using its nose and ears,and also by noticing subtle clues such as air currents andvibrations, a dragon can sense everything in its immediatevicinity, even with its eyes closed, when shrouded in mag-ical darkness, or when swathed in impenetrable fog. Of course, some phenomena are entirely visual in nature(such as color), and a dragon that cannot see cannot per-ceive these phenomena. TASTE A dragon’s sense of taste is highly discriminating. Dragonscan note the slightest variations in the taste of water or food,and most dragons develop some peculiar culinary prefer-ences as a result. Copper dragons, for example, relish ven-omous vermin. Perhaps the most infamous draconic taste isthe red dragon’s preference for the flesh of young women. Curiously, dragons don’t seem to respond well to sweet flavors. Whether this is because they don’t like sweets orbecause they have difficulty distinguishing sweet flavors is unclear. Most dragons refuse to discuss the matter. TOUCH Thanks to its thick, scaly hide and clawed feet, a dragon hasvery little tactile sense. Smaller, younger dragons who haveyet to develop impressive natural armor have better sensesof touch than older dragons, making touch the only one ofa dragon’s senses that gets less acute as a dragon grows andages. A dragon interested in a object’s texture might touchor stroke the object with its tongue. Even so, a dragon’stongue proves better at tasting than touching. A dragon’s muted sense of touch might explain its pref- erence for nests made from piles of coins, gems, or othertreasure. A bed of so many small, hard, sometimes pointyobjects might prove highly uncomfortable to a human, butto a dragon such an arrangement offers a comfortable tickle,like a nubby wool blanket. FLIGHT “A dragon in flight? Do you call that flying?” —Kal’ ostikillam, djinni “Dragons are stately and powerful flyers, able to stay on the wing for days.” —Yunni Cupuricus, sage Some sages speculate that a dragon’s ability to fly is partially magical; however, dragons have been known to take wingand maneuver inside antimagic areas where their spells andbreath weapons do not work. A dragon owes its ability to fly,and its flight characteristics, to its peculiar anatomy andmetabolism. A dragon weighs much less than a strictly ter-restrial creature of the same size does, and its muscles—par-ticularly the ones that enable it to fly—are exceptionallystrong, giving the dragon’s wings enough power to lift thedragon into the air. A dragon’s biggest problem in flight is just getting aloft. Given the chance, a dragon prefers to launch itself from a height, where it canCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS gain speed by diving initially . Failing that, a dragon takes flight by leaping into the air, giving itself a boost by snap-ping its tail downward and pushing off with its hind legs. Once airborne, a dragon stays aloft with deceptively slow and stately wing beats. The wings develop tremendous liftand thrust on each stroke, allowing the dragon to coast forbrief periods. To further conserve energy in flight, a dragonmakes use of any updrafts it can find. Under the right con-ditions, a dragon can soar for hours with little effort. Adragon attempting to fly a long distance usually begins byfinding an updraft and spiraling upward to a comfortablealtitude, then soaring from one updraft to another. Dragonscan quickly cover great distances in this manner. A dragon in straight and level flight holds its body fairly straight, with its neck and tail extended, its front legs tuckedunder its chest, and its rear legs thrown back. The dragon’spowerful neck and tail, along with the frills on its back, helpkeep it on course. Although a dragon’s wings do not resemblea bird’s wings, a dragon uses its wings as a bird of prey does,with smooth, steady downstrokes and quick upstrokes. Wyrmlings are much less majestic flyers than older drag- ons; they have smaller wings and are forced to beat themfuriously to stay aloft. They resemble fluttering bats whenin flight. Despite their vast wingspans, dragons can fly through rel- atively narrow openings simply by folding their wings andcoasting through. Most dragons have difficulty executing quick maneuvers in the air. They prefer to make wide, slow turns, using theirtails as rudders. If a more violent maneuver is necessary, adragon uses its head and tail to turn itself, and it can alsoalter the shape and stroke of its wings. Even so, a dragon hasa wide turning circle, and only the smallest and mostmaneuverable dragon can turn within itsown length. Many dragons have perfected some acrobatic tricks to help themmaneuver in tight spaces.The first of these is hov-ering. Normally,a dragon must maintain some forward momentum to stay in the air, but some dragons can beat their wings with enoughspeed and efficiency to halt their forward motion and hoverin place. While hovering, a dragon can fly straight up, straightdown, sideways, or even backward. Hovering takes consider-able effort, however, and a dragon can do little else while ithovers. The downdraft created by a hovering dragon is con-siderable, and can create huge clouds of dust and debris. Somedragons can even use this downdraft as a weapon. Other dragons can take advantage of their supple bodies to perform a wingover—a sort of aerial somersault that letsthem change direction quickly . The dragon thrusts the frontof its body upward and twists its body into a spin. This maneu-ver allows the dragon to turn in place through an arc of up to180 degrees while maintaining its present altitude. OTHER MODES OF MOVEMENT “Not every dragon falls upon you like a thunderbolt from theheavens.” —Stewart Debruk, dragon hunter A dragon doesn’t have to take to the air to demonstrate amaz- ing speed. RUNNING OR WALKING A dragon on the ground moves like a cat, and can be just asgraceful (though the bigger dragons tend to lumber along).When it’s not in a hurry, a 19CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 20dragon walks by moving two legs at a time. The dragon lifts one forefoot and the hind foot on the opposite side. Like acat, with each step a dragon places its hind foot in the placewhere the corresponding forefoot was. As it strides along, a dragon keeps its wings loosely furled at its side. If it is feeling lazy, it lets its tail drag behind. Usu-ally, however, a dragon holds its tail off the ground, and thetail slowly moves from side to side in time with the dragon’sgait. The motion helps the dragon keep its balance. The tail sometimes brushes the ground, but only briefly and usuallywell to the left or right of the dragon’s body . A running dragon can easily outpace the finest horse. It uses a galloping motion, moving both front legs together,followed by both back legs. The wings stay furled, but thedragon spreads them occasionally to maintain balance. Thetail is held high.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by J. J arvis",

A dragon with the water breathing ability can do anything in the water that it can do out of the water, including using its breath weapon.A dragon holding its breath underwater must obey all the normal rules for doing so. Most dragons can hold their breatheswithout difficulty for quite long periods, thanks to their impres- sive Constitution scores. A dragon holding its breath can use its breath weapon underwater.

        "description":  "BURROWING DRAGONS Burrowing dragons can move only through fairly soft mate- rial such as sand, loamy soil, snow, or ice. The material alsomust be fairly dry. A burrowing dragon cannot dig through mud, for example. pqqqqrspqqqqrsSWIMMING All true dragons can swim, though only a few kinds can be considered truly aquatic. Aquatic dragons have long, flat tailsand webbing between their toes or in their shoulder joints. A swimming dragon usually moves like a big reptile. It folds its wings tightly against its body and throws its legsback, creating a streamlined shape. It moves its body left toright in a sinuous motion, and its tail lashes from side toside, providing propulsion. The truly aquatic dragons some-times employ their wings as big fins in the manner of a rayor an aquatic bird. The frill along a dragon’s back helps it stay on course when swimming underwater, and also keeps the dragon from rolling over. A swimming dragon steers with its head, tail, and feet.A dragon swimming at the surface often holds its head and neck out of the water, which allows it to scan the surfacewhile most of its body remains submerged. A dragon alsooccasionally swims with just the upper half of its head out ofthe water. This restricts the dragon’s field of vision some-what, but makes it practically undetectable. Most dragons are obliged to hold their breath when submerged. However, the truly aquatic types can breatheunderwater as easily as they take in water and extractoxygen from it. The dragon inhales water through itsnose, and the water floods the lungs and is exhaledthrough the nose. The dragon handles the process as easilyat it breathes air. BURROWING Any dragon can gouge out holes in the ground with itsclaws, but some dragons can also worm their waythrough sand or loose earth, moving as quickly as ahuman can move at a brisk walk. Burrowing dragons tend to have shorter,thicker necks thanother dragons, stub-bier legs, and wedge-shaped heads. Whenburrowing, the drag-on pushes with its head and uses itsfront feet to claw awaymaterial. The back legskick the loosened mate-rial back past the dragon’sbody . The tunnel the dragonmakes when burrowing usuallycollapses behind it. COMBAT ABILITIES “Battle is a dragon’s natural element; it is made for combat. It hasteeth like spears, claws like scimitars, wings like hammers, and atail like a battering ram. Lesser beings cower in its presence, and itsbreath fells armies.” — Munwithurix, red dragonThe vanity of dragons is legendary . Indeed, they have much to boast about, including a fearsome array of natural weap-onry and a host of more subtle abilities that make them allbut invincible in combat. BREATH WEAPONS The most infamous weapon in a dragon’s formidable arse-nal is its devastating breath. The chromatic dragons canproduce blasts of elemental energy; the type of energyvaries with the kind of dragon. The metallic dragons canproduce elemental breath weapons, too, but they also pro-duce a second type of breath that is nonlethal but potentin its own way . No matter what form its breath weapon takes, a dragon generates it from deep inside its lungs, using energy gen-erated from an organ near its heart called the draconisfundamentum (page 8). Fortunately for dragon hunters, adragon cannot produce breath weapon effects continu-ously . Each breath depletes the dragon’s inner reserves ofenergy, and it usually requires at least a few seconds to pro-duce another breath. To use its breath weapon, the dragon first draws a very deep inhalation. If sufficient energy is avail- able, the dragon immediately expels the weapon in a violent exhalation. If not, the dragon must wait until more energy builds up. The effect is not unlike a blacksmith fan-ning a fire that is slightly too small. A puff of air from thebellows produces intense heat, but burns up all the fire’sfuel, forcing the smith to add more fuel before fanning theflame again. A dragon seems to remain aware of the state ofits inner energy and never tries to use its breath weapon toosoon. Dragons, however, do not seem to have much controlover how quickly their inner energy replenishes itself. A dragon can discharge its breath weapon with little or no forewarning. Some dragons are adept at convincing timor-ous foes that a breath could come at any moment. 21CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 22FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE The mere appearance of a dragon can send pack animals fleeing in terror and shake the resolve of the most stalwartsoldier. Usually, a dragon must be of at least young adult ageto have this power. Though some commentators speak of dragons inspiring supernatural fear, a dragon’s frightful presence has no mag-ical component. Dragons are simply very good at strikingfear in the hearts of foes, and they can do so whenever theytake any action that is the least bit aggressive. IMMUNITIES AND DEFENSES Though most forms of attack have at least a slim chance ofworking against a dragon, some attacks prove useless. Every true dragon is immune to at least one type of ele- mental energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire), usually thesame type of energy as the dragon uses for its breathweapon. This immunity stems from the dragon’s elementalnature. The same power that allows it to belch forth a blastof energy also keeps that energy from harming the dragon.True dragons have superb internal temperature regulation and seldom suffer from the effects of excessive heat or cold. In addition, all draconic creatures are not subject to ef- fects that put them to sleep or induce paralysis; such crea-tures possess an unstoppable vitality . True dragons also develop a supernatural resistance to physical blows, which can prevent nonmagical weaponsfrom harming them at all. Bards’ tales about maraudingdragons enduring hails of arrows from defending archerswithout suffering so much as a scratch are all too true. Thanks to their innately magical nature, true dragons also develop the power to shrug off the effects of spells. Olderdragons ignore spell assaults from all but the most powerfulmagical practitioners. MAGICAL ABILITIES All dragons develop innate magical abilities as they age.Among these is the ability to cast arcane spells. A dragon’s innate magical abilities tend to reflect the character and attitudes of its species. For example, blackCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS",

As noted in the Monster Manual, when a dragon uses a breath weapon, it must wait 1d4 rounds before it can breathe again. In this case, a round lasts until the dragon’s next turnbegins (see The Combat Round, page 138 of the Player’s Handbook ). For example, if a dragon breathes in the first round of combat, and the die roll for when the breath weapon can next be used is a 1, the dragon can breathe again in round 2. If thedie roll is a 4, the dragon could not breathe again until round 5. If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. The Recover Breathfeat (see page 73) can shorten the time a dragon has to wait between uses of its breath weapon.

        "description":  "FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE A dragon’s frightful presence is an extraordinary ability. It works even in antimagic areas. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear ability that takes effect whenever a dragon attacks, charges, or merely flies over- head. A dragon can inspire fear by flying overhead at an alti-tude low enough to place foes with the radius of the effect,which is 30 feet ×the dragon’s age category (usually at least 150 feet, since most dragons gain this ability at the young adult stage). A dragon’s frightful presence also takes effect wheneverthe dragon charges or attacks in any way (with natural weapons, spells, or a breath weapon). Using frightful presence is part of whatever action triggers it. A dragon does not have to take a separate action to use the power; however, a dragon can suppress its frightful presence ability as a free action. A creature must be able to see the dragon for its frightful presence ability to take effect. If the dragon is invisible or hastotal concealment, the ability does not work. Once the ability takes effect, however, the consequences persist for the full duration, even if the dragon later passes from sight. Creatures within the ability’s radius are not affected if they have more HitDice than the dragon, or if they are dragons themselves. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD + dragon’s Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon’s frightful presence for 24 hours. (Thistemporary immunity occurs only on a successful save. If a creature doesn’t have to make a save because it cannot see the dragon, it is not immune and must make a save when it doessee the dragon.) On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds, and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. As an extraordinary ability, frightful presence remains effec- tive even when the dragon assumes a different form. Bronze, gold, and silver dragons, which have the ability to assume an alternate form, usually suppress their frightful presence abilitywhen using assumed forms, to avoid compromising their disguises. If they wish to avoid fighting, however, they can use their frightful presence ability if they are challenged when intheir assumed forms.",

Even a Tiny dragonis typically as well armored as a human wearing chainmail.A big dragon’s scaly hide provides four or five times moreprotection than the best suit of plate armor can offer. A dragon’s primary weapon in physical combat is its bite. A dragon can bite at creatures a fair distance way, thanks toits long neck. A dragon’s claws are not as fearsome as its bite, and a dragon on the move often does not use its claws, but anyonefighting a dragon should be wary of them nevertheless. A dragon of roughly human size or larger can strike effectively with the alar limbs at the forward edges of itswings. Though the alar limbs have vestigial claws, the wingis a bludgeoning weapon. A dragon usually keeps the “fin-gers” supporting the wing closed to avoid damaging thewing, much like a human clenches his fist when deliver-ing a punch. A dragon’s wings may span hundreds of feetwhen they are fully extended, but it uses only a fairly smallportion of the wing as a weapon. A dragon of larger than human size can use its tail 23CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 24 CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT",

        "description":  "MAGICAL ABILITIES As noted in the Monster Manual, creatures with innate spell- casting abilities, such as dragons, do not require material com-ponents to cast their spells. If a spell has a focus, however, a dragon or other innate spellcaster must have the focus on its person. Dragons can use the Embed Spell Focus feat to satisfythis requirement. Except for not needing consumable material components, dragons cast their spells in the same way other arcane spell-casters do. They are subject to arcane spell failure if they wear armor. (Their own natural armor does not impose an arcanespell failure chance.) They must provide any verbal and somatic components the spell has, and they must pay any XP cost the spell entails. A dragon typically has a cushion of 100 to 600 XP times its spellcaster level. It can use these XP in spellcastingwithout risking the loss of a level. Also as noted in the Monster Manual , a dragon’s caster level for its spell-like abilities is equal to its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher. Although dragons cast spells as sorcerers, they are not members of the sorcerer class and receive none of that class’s benefits (except for spellcasting). A dragon gains bonus spellseach day for a high Charisma score. A dragon that becomes a member of the sorcerer class adds any actual sorcerer levels it has to its effective sorcerer level to determine its spellcastingability, but uses its actual sorcerer level and character level to determine its other class abilities. For example, an old silver dragon casts spells as an 11th-level sorcerer. If the dragonbecomes a 1st-level sorcerer, it casts spells as a 12th-levelsorcerer, but its familiar (if it has one) has the abilities of a familiar with a 1st-level master. As noted in the Monster Manual, most of a dragon’s spell- like abilities function as the spells of the same name cast at a level equal to the dragon’s sorcerer level or its age category, whichever is higher. A dragon with the alternate form racial ability is proficient with all simple weapons. Other kinds of dragons have no weapon proficiencies unless they actually have levels in a char-acter class or they use feats to become proficient.",

        "description":  "DRAGONS AND MAGIC ITEMS Being both very smart and very wealthy, dragons often employmagic items. A younger dragon without any spellcasting ability—even if it has one or more spell-like abilities—cannot use spell comple- tion items or spell trigger items. An older dragon casts spells as a sorcerer and is an arcane spellcaster; it cannot cast a divine spell from a scroll unless it has levels in a divine spellcasting class. Because a dragon can cast spells as a sorcerer, it can use any spell trigger item that produc es the effect of a sorcerer/wizard spell. If the dragon also can cast cleric spells as arcane spells,it can use any spell trigger item that produc es the effect of a spell from the cleric spell list or a spell from a domain to which the dragon has access. A dragon usually lacks weapon proficiencies and fully prehen- sile appendages, so it cannot employ weapons. If a dragon assumes a form with prehensile appendages, it can wield weap- ons while in that form, but it remains nonproficient unless ithas lvels in a class or a feat that makes it proficient (as notedearlier, a dragon with the alternate form racial ability is profi- cient with all simple weapons). Any dragon is capable of using potions. In most circum- stances, a dragon doesn’t even bother opening a potion con-tainer; it simply swallows it or chews it up. Because a dragon can eat just about anything, this doesn’t cause any problems for the dragon, nor does it change the effect of the potion inany way. Because magic items that must be worn will fit users of any size, a dragon can use any magic item a humanoid char-acter can. A dragon can use a headband, hat, or helmet normally. In some cases, an item of this kind can be specially made for a dragon in the form of a crown, diadem, or skullcap. Forexample, a dragon’s helm of telepathy may be in the form of a skullcap of telepathy. Goggles and lenses made for dragons usually come in the form of cusps that fit over the dragon’s eyes, or lenses thedragon places directly on its eyes, much like modern contactlenses. A humanoid character can use any special dragon itemof this kind without difficulty. A dragon can wear a cloak, cape, or mantle on its back, usually between the wings. Items of this sort can come in the form of a frill stud or spine cap instead. A humanoid charactercan use a frill stud or spine cap by affixing it to a cloak, cape, or mantle. A dragon wears amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, and periapts around its neck, just as a humanoid does. A dragon is not proficient with any kind of armor and usually does not bother wearing armor. In any case, armor crafted fora humanoid does not fit a dragon’s body. Armor created for a dragon resembles barding and will not fit a humanoid, but will fit a quadruped of the same size as the dragon. A dragon can wear a robe over its shoulders and upper chest. In some cases, a item of this kind can be specially made for a dragon in the form of a collar or epaulette. A humanoid can wear such an item without difficulty. A dragon can wear a vest, vestment, or shirt draped around its wings and lower chest. In some cases, a item of this kind can be specially made for a dragon in the form of a pectoralstud or a belly stud. A humanoid can wear a magical dragon pectoral stud as though it were a vest. It can wear a belly stud in its navel. A dragon can fit bracers or bracelets over its lower forelimbs. A dragon can wear gloves or gauntlets on its forefeet. Specially made dragon gauntlets usually have no fingers, justholes for the dragon’s claws. A humanoid can wear magicaldragon gauntlets without difficulty. A dragon can wear rings on its front claws. A dragon can wear a belt around its midsection. Some- times, items of this kind take the form of bands the dragon wears on its hips. A humanoid can wear such items without difficulty. A dragon can wear boots on its hind feet. Specially made dragon boots usually resemble a dragon’s gauntlets, but are shaped for the hind foot. These magic items also fit human-oid feet. None of these items interferes with a dragon’s movement, including flight. pqqqqrspqqqqrsto deliver powerful blows. To do so, the dragon curls the tip of its tail upward and uses the upturned portion as a bludg-eoning weapon. The biggest dragons have enough power intheir tails to sweep them from side to side, knocking oversmaller foes. Very big dragons also can use their entire bodies as weapons, crashing into smaller opponents and pinningthem to the ground, whereupon the dragon literally grindsthem into the dirt. DRAGON WEAKNESSES “Weakness? Come test thy mettle against me, hairless ape, and weshall know who is weak!” — Lothaenorixius, blue dragon As formidable at they are, dragons have a few vulnerabilities their foes can exploit. Dragons often prove susceptible to attacks involving an opposing element. For example, red dragons are immune tofire but vulnerable to cold. A dragon’s elemental nature also makes it susceptible to the divine influence wielded by certain clerics, who candrive them off, compel them to render service, or even killthem outright. Dragons, however, become very powerfulentities as they age, and the influence of such clerics onlyproves reliable against younger dragons. OUTLOOK AND PSYCHOLOGY “A good answer today is better than the perfect answer tomorrow.” —Human aphorism “What’s your hurry?” —Common dragon response to the aforementioned aphorism The most important element shaping a dragon’s outlook and state of mind is time. Dragons have no desire to live for themoment; they have a vast supply of moments stretching outbefore them. They do not worry about wasted time. If drag-ons have anything in excess, it is time, and they do not con-cern themselves with haste. Even the dullards among dragonkind seek to fill their time by exercising their minds. Solving puzzles is a favoriteactivity, though the form these puzzles take depends on thekind of dragon involved. Some, such as the bronze and the copper, seek out challenging puzzles of a benign nature.Others, such as the red and the blue, contemplate a muchdarker brand of conundrums. They plot ways to satisfy theirgreed, to defeat opponents, and to gain power over othercreatures. Many scholars believe that dragons owe their nat-ural aptitude for magic to the mental games they constantlyplay just to keep themselves occupied. Many dragons also seek knowledge for its own sake. Older dragons often become repositories of ancient wisdomand lore. Humanoid adventurers usually seek fame and fortune through three stages of their lives (adolescence, adulthood,and middle age). Even the longest-lived elf attempts to cramthe bulk of his accomplishments into these phases of life.Dragons, on the other hand, through desire and necessity,seek fame and fortune from the moment they emerge fromthe egg to the day they finally succumb to time’s erodingwaves. Because it spreads its life activities out across its verylong life span, a dragon takes much longer breaks betweenquests and adventures than a group of humanoid adventur-ers would take. If a dragon were to join a group of adventurers, it might remain interested long enough to complete one or two quests.Then something else might catch its interest, and it wouldleave for years to engage in another activity . Upon returning,it would discover its former companions to be nearing retire-ment or already too old to go questing. The dragon, however,would still be young and vital, and growing stronger witheach passing year. Although it would feel sadness at the lossof its companions, it would move on to new challenges. All true dragons have great patience. They seldom hurry or rush, because they believe anything worth doing is worthdoing right. For a dragon, doing something right usuallyinvolves spending a long time (from the viewpoint ofshorter-lived beings) contemplating the next step. A dragon’s longevity is perhaps the major source of its vanity and arrogance. A single dragon can watch a parade ofbeings come and go during its long life. How can a dragonconsider such creatures as anything more than inferiorswhen it watches so many of them enter life, grow old, anddie? And all the while, the dragon grows stronger and morepowerful, proving its superiority (if only in its own mind).Dragons hold at bay the powerful entity of time, whereaslesser creatures succumb and fade with nary a struggle. Withsuch power at its command, is it any wonder that a dragonbelieves itself to be the very pinnacle of creation? 25CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS",

        "description":  "DRAGON WEAKNESSES A dragon is vulnerable to the type of energy that opposes its elemental subtype, as noted in the Monster Manual . A dragon takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from at- tacks involving its opposing energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.The feats Overcome Weakness and Suppress Weakness (see pages 72 and 74) reduce this vulnerability.Clerics with access to the air, earth, fire, or water domains can turn, destroy, rebuke, or command dragons of the appro- priate elemental subtype. Since the effectiveness of these abil-ities is based on the defending creature’s Hit Dice, older andlarger dragons seldom fall prey to them, but they can be effec- tive against smaller and younger dragons. pqqqqrspqqqqrs26 A dragon can spring into action quickly if it finds its own life in peril, or if it must protect its mate, its offspring, or itshoard. Otherwise, few problems seem urgent. A dragon’s wrath can stretch on for many human genera- tions, matching the creature’s patience. The humanoid whowrongs a dragon may escape its wrath by dying a natural deathbefore the dragon gets around to exacting revenge. Thehumanoid’s descendants, however, should be wary if theyknow about the situation, because the dragon might strike atthem years or centuries after the original perpetrator has died. DRAGON SOCIETY “Dragons never gather without purpose.” —Kacdaninymila, gold dragon Dragons keep to themselves, breaking their solitude only to mate, rear offspring, or obtain help in meeting some threat.Dragons of different species seldom form alliances, thoughthey have been known to cooperate under extreme circum-stances, such as when a powerful mutual threat arises. Some scholars believe dragons suffer from xeno- phobia. This view is not far fromthe truth—any dragon simplyenjoys its own company.When it becomes pru-dent or necessary tohave a companion,a dragon seeksone out, but itprefers a com-panion asmuch likeitself aspossible. Metallic drag- ons of differentspecies are more aptto cooperate with eachother than chromaticdragons are, thoughonly gold and silverdragons are known to forge lastingfriend ships. The loquacious brass drag- ons enjoy the company of other metal-lic dragons, but most dragons (even otherbrass dragons) prefer to take brass dragonsin small doses. Metallic dragons never cooperate with chro-matic dragons. When evil dragons of different varieties encounter one another, they usually fight to protect their territories. Gooddragons are more tolerant, though also very territorial, andusually try to work out differences in a peaceful manner. TERRITORY A dragon usually claims all the territory within a day’s flyingtime of its lair. The dragon will share this area with no otherdragons except its mate and offspring (if it has any), andeven then, younger dragons most often part after mating and leave their eggs untended. Though chromatic dragons are not eager to share terri- tory, they tolerate some overlap between their territoriesand those of neighboring dragons of the same species oralignment. These boundary areas become places wheredragons can meet to parlay and exchange information. Inmany cases, a dragon shares overlapping territory with amate or a potential mate. Among dragons too young to mate, the need for security and defense usually overrides the desire for solitude.Clutches of dragons born together usually stick togetheruntil each individual is strong enough to survive on its ownand establish its own lair. CONFLICT AND INTERACTION BETWEEN DRAGONS When dragons fight, the conflict is seldom over territory . It is much easier for a dragon to simply take wing and find anunclaimed area than to risk injury and death in a battle withanother dragon. Dragons most often fight for the opportu- nity to loot each other’s lairs. A dragon’s desire to amass large amounts of treasure is legendary, even among the dragons themselves, and every dragon knows that a victory over a rival is often the best way to gain wealth. Drag- ons also fight over mates (such contests are not limited to males) and usually try to kill or drive away neighbor- ing dragons of dif- ferent alignments. Enmity is par- ticularly strong among chromat- ic and metallic dragons that typically inhabit similar territories. Blue dragons and brass dragons, for example, both prefer to live in deserts and often come into conflict. When two or more dragons meet and wish to avoid a conflict, they usually take to the air and circle slowly, each examin- ing the other carefully . If the dragons are of different sizes or ages, these preliminaries end fairly quickly . Status among dragons comes with age. Older drag-ons know they have little to fear from younger dragons,provided the senior dragon is not already injured. Youngerdragons are likewise aware that their older brethren canCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS slay them easily, and they know that negotiating gives them the best chance of surviving the encounter. If the dragons in an encounter are the same age or size, they tend to be much more cautious, since a sudden attackby either dragon could doom the other. The dragons mightcircle each other for hours. Once the preliminaries are over, the dragons converse. If they remain suspicious of each other, they stay aloft, with theolder dragon or dragons slightly higher. While aloft, the drag-ons are obliged to bellow at each other, since they can’t easilyclose to conversational distance. Thanks to a dragon’s keenears and tremendous vocal capacity, this hindrance to com-munication doesn’t present much of a problem. If the dragonsbecome comfortable with one another, they often fly off tosome high, inaccessible place where they can speak in private. MATING A dragon’s attitude and approach to mating depend on itsspecies and its age. Dragons follow a number of reproduc-tive strategies to suit their needs and temperaments. Thesestrategies help assure the continuation of a dragon’s blood-line, no matter what happens to the parent or the lair. Young adults, particularly evil or less intelligent ones, tend to lay annual clutches of eggs all around the country-side, leaving their offspring to fend for themselves. Olderfemales sometimes lay eggs once a decade or even less often,but they usually produce at least one clutch during each agecategory in which they remain fertile. Often an older femalelays several clutches of eggs over successive years, keepingone clutch to tend herself, giving one clutch to her mate(who carries the eggs to a separate lair), and leaving the restuntended. Sometimes a female dragon places eggs (or newlyhatched wyrmlings) with nondraconic foster parents. Adult and mature adult dragons are most likely to mate for the long term and to share the task of rearing young. Older dragons are the most likely to mate and then raise their young on their own, and even males do so (with thefemale laying her eggs in the male’s lair or the male carryingthe eggs to his lair). Older dragons also sometimes arrangenondragon surrogate parents for their offspring. One orboth parents visit the surrogates periodically to determinehow well they are handling the task. Dragon mating is not all about reproduction, however, and dragons often mate out of love. This is particularly trueamong metallic dragons, but love certainly exists amongchromatic dragons as well. Dragons of lawful alignmentoften mate for life (though if one of the two dies, the otherusually finds a new mate). Dragons mated for life do notalways remain together. They frequently maintain separatelairs and agree to meet at intervals. Lawful dragons are notalways monogamous, and they have been known to buildcomplex intricate living and breeding arrangements withmultiple partners. Such relationships usually are builtaround an older dragon and younger mates, and can beeither polygamous or polyandrous. Chaotic dragons tend to change mates frequently, though as they get older they often develop a preference fora single mate.Dragons are notoriously virile, able to crossbreed with vir- tually any creature. Among metallic dragons, crossbreedingoften occurs when the dragon assumes another shape andfalls in love, however briefly, with a nondragon. Chromaticdragons may simply feel adventuresome and create cross-breeds as a result. In either case, the dragon involved usuallyis a young adult. A dragon almost always either abandons itshalf-dragon offspring or leaves it in the care of its nondragonparent. Chromatic dragons typically remain unconcernedabout the half-dragon’s fate. Metallic dragons believe (usu-ally correctly) that the half-dragon will fare better amongnondragons than it ever will among dragons. Crossbreeds between dragon species are not unknown, but very rare. A hybrid dragon of this sort is usually left tofend for itself, but on occasion both parents (if they are ongood terms with each other) might watch over it until itreaches adulthood. WHY DO DRAGONS HOARD TREASURE? “Dragons lust for treasure because, at heart, they are nothing butlarge, reptilian jackdaws.” —Alrod Duart, sage “A dragon collects treasure mainly for its beauty—you don’t think there can be too much beauty, do you? Besides, some treasure is verygood eating.” —Kacdaninymila, gold dragon When one thinks of a dragon piling up treasure and using it as a bed, it’s easy to accuse the creature of greed. After all,what good is all that wealth doing anyone? Some sages equate a dragon’s desire to amass treasure with the behavior of jackdaws, pack rats, and other creaturesthat instinctively hoard bright, shiny objects. This observa-tion is not without merit, because no dragon seems entirelyable to explain why it wants to hoard treasure. Unlike a jack-daw or a pack rat, however, a dragon craves items of mone-tary value, not just shiny objects. Dragons are well aware ofthe value of their possessions. When faced with a selectionof treasure, even the most virtuous dragon would like totake it all. If it has to choose, the dragon tends to favor themost valuable items. Dragons show a preference for itemswith intrinsic monetary value over items that are valuablebecause of their magic. The sheer, primal joy a dragon derives from its hoard is nearly indescribable. In unguarded moments, a dragon willroll in a pile of treasure like a pig wallowing in the mud ona hot day, and the dragon seems to derive a similar degree ofphysical pleasure from the action. A dragon also derives immense intellectual satisfaction from its hoard. It keeps an accurate mental inventory of the items init, and a running total of the hoard’s total monetary value. The draconic preoccupation with treasure doubtless has an instinctive element that may never be fully explained, buttreasure hoarding among dragons has some practical benefits. First, having a valuable treasure at hand gives the dragon some control over the circumstances of its own death (seeAvoiding the Twilight, page 15). Dragons that lose their 27CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 28hoards often suffer so much emotional trauma that their spirits become restless even after death (see Ghostly Dragon,page 161). Second, and more important, dragons derive status among their own kind from the richness of their hoards.Though the primary measure of status among dragons isage, the value of a dragon’s hoard is what determines the rel-ative status of dragons of the same age (when comparinghoard values, dragons consider magic items to be worthone-half their market value). A particularly large hoard canplace a younger dragon on equal terms with an older dragon;a small one can demote it to an even lower status than its agealone would indicate.Dragons with higher status have better access to mates. They have more influence among other dragons, and aremore likely to be asked to render assistance or advice. Thisin turn increases their status even more. Dragons tend to boast about the value of their hoards among their own kind, which is understandable, since adragon cannot derive any status from its hoard unless otherdragons know about it. Such boasting is not without peril,however, particularly among chromatic dragons, since evildragons are not above stealing treasure from each other. Among older dragons, treasure hoarding has an addi- tional practical dimension. As a dragon ages, its magicalaptitude gets greater, and the dragon becomes better able toemploy the magic items in its hoard to its advantage. LANGUAGE The language of dragons is one of the oldest forms of com-munication. According to the dragons themselves, it issecond in longevity only to the languages of the outsiders,and all mortal tongues are descended from it. Its script waslikely created long after its spoken form was standardized,since dragons have less need to write than other races. SomeCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS DRAGONS AND THE APPRAISE SKILL Though most dragons do not have the Appraise skill, dragons can appraise items readily, thanks to their high Intelligencescores. A dragon gains a +2 competence bonus on any Appraise check (or Intelligence check made to appraise an item) that involves studying physical aspects of the appraised item (suchas fine details or weight). pqspqsscholars believe the written form of Draconic might have been influenced by dwarven runes, but the wise don’texpress this opinion within hearing of a dragon. Many reptilian races (including kobolds, lizardfolk, and troglodytes) speak crude versions of Draconic, andpresent this as proof of their kinship with dragons. It is equally likely that these races were once taught orenslaved by dragons, and it is even possible that they tookDraconic for their own simply to make a claim to com-mon ancestors. 29CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS BASIC DRACONIC VOCABULARY What follows is a selection of words from the Draconic vocabulary, along with translations and the part of speech of the word (adj=adjective,adv=adverb, conj=conjunction, n=noun, prep=preposition,pron=pronoun, v=verb).

How-ever, this use of the written form does not make it any easierfor someone who knows Draconic to learn the languages ofair and fire creatures. Slight variations exist in the language used by the various kinds of chromatic dragons. These differences are similar toregional accents, with some slight differences in pronunci-ation from one version to the next. The accents do nothamper communication, but they are sufficiently obviousfor a native speaker to know whether someone learned tospeak Draconic from (for instance) a red dragon or a greendragon. The various metallic dragons have similar accents,but without any differences in pronunciation. The Draconiclanguage has not changed significantly for hundreds, if notthousands, of years. The spoken form of the language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants andsibilants. It includes sounds that humans generally describeas hissing (sj, ss, and sv), as well as a noise that sounds a greatdeal like a beast clearing its throat (ach). Words that modify other words are placed before and after the word they modify . The most important modifier is alwaysplaced before the word, and it might be placed directly afterthe word as well if additional emphasis is desired. A speakerof Draconic who wanted to say a big, black, evil dragon wasapproaching and doubly emphasize its evil nature would say,“Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha gethrisj leirith” or even“Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha malsvir gethrisj leirith.” Most Draconic words are spoken with emphasis on the first syllable. Important ideas are often expressed in spokenDraconic by emphasizing the beginning and the end of theword. In the written form, important words are markedwith a special symbol of five lines radiating outward, similarto an asterisk (*). This form of emphasis is most often usedby dragons when referring to themselves. The dragon Kara-jix, for example, might pronounce his name Ka-raj- ixand write it as *Karajix*. This form of emphasis is also some-times used when commanding, threatening, warning, ormaking a point. Draconic has no specific word for “my” or “mine,” instead using several prefixes depending on the exact meaning. Thename of a physical object claimed as a possession by a dragonspeaker would begin with “veth” or “vethi”; the name of anindividual with a relationship to the dragon (such as a friendor relative) is expressed by the prefix “er” or “ethe”; and allother forms of possessiveness are represented by putting“ar” or “ari” before a word. Thus, for a dragon to say “my sword”or “the sword is mine” he need only say “vethicaex” (“vethi”plus “caex,” the word for sword), and “arirlym” translates as“my enemy” (“ar” plus “irlym,” the word for enemy). Whenindicating possession by another, the name of the possessoris combined with the object possessed into a single wordthat starts with “ar” or “ari.” PIDGIN DRACONIC Here are some sample sentences and their translations intoDraconic.Mialee, talk to the ugly elf. Mialee, ukris vaecaesin nurh. The elf says the magic sword we want is in the lich’s tomb. Vaecaesin ner levex caex levex yth tuor persvek arikaegrowaere.

RELIGION The dragon deities are all children of Io, the NinefoldDragon who encompasses all the opposites and extremesof dragonkind. Creatures other than dragons can worship one of the deities described here. Just as a human weaponsmith might venerateMoradin, or an elf archer pay homage to Ehlonna, so too coulda dwarf, half-orc, or kobold worship a god or goddess otherwiseassociated with dragons. In fact, such worship is particularlycommon among the various reptilian (and Draconic-speaking) races, such as kobolds, lizardfolk, and troglodytes.

All these numbers are average values and vary by as much as 25%, up or down, for any individual dragon.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS BLACK DRAGONS Black dragons are among the most evil-tempered true dragons. They prefer dismal swamps or bogs, the morestagnant and fetid the better, but can be encountered any-where water and dense vegetation are found together—including jungles, rain forests, and moors. They have nonatural enemies, though they attack and kill almost any-thing unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. Blackdragons living in forest areas often encounter green drag-ons, but the two species usually manage to maintain anuneasy truce, so long as the black dragons stick to thewatery areas. Black dragons make their lairs in large, damp caves or multichambered submerged caverns. They always dwell nearwater, and their lairs usually have a submerged entrance anda land entrance. Older black dragons hide both entrances totheir lairs with plant growth.Black dragons dwelling in dungeons prefer dark, watery locations. Black Dragon Identifiers A black dragon has deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal open-ings that make its face look like a skull. It has segmentedhorns that curve forward and down, somewhat like a ram’shorns, but not as curly . These horns are bone-colored neartheir bases, but darken to dead black at the tips. As the dragonages, the flesh around the horns and cheekbones deterio-rates, as though eaten by acid, leaving only thin layers ofhide covering the skull. This phenomenon is not harmful tothe dragon, but enhances its skeletal appearance. Most of a black dragon’s teeth protrude when the mouth is closed, and big spikes stud the lower jaw. A pair of smallhorns jut from the chin, and a row of hornlets crown thehead. The tongue is flat, with a forked tip, and the dragon often drools acidic slime. 37CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by S.

A black dragon flying overhead is marked by a distinctive profile. Its horns, with their characteristic forward curve, areclearly visible. The wing membranes are marked with blobbystripes, and the leading edges of the wings are fringed or scal-loped near the tips. A black dragon also has exceptionallylong alar thumbs. The trailing edges of the wing membranesjoin the body ahead of the back legs. On hatching, a black dragon’s scales are thin, small, and glossy . As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, andduller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes. Habits Black dragons dine primarily on fish, mollusks, and otheraquatic creatures. They also hunt for red meat but like to“pickle” it by letting it lie in ponds within or near their lairsfor days before being eaten. The rotting flesh helps make thearea even more foul—just the way the dragon likes it. Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older and craftier dragons sometimes capture and question human-oids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coinsbefore killing them. Others move out into nearby rivers orlakes, where they menace boat traffic and demand that pass-ing vessels pay tribute. In keeping with their reputation for ferocity, black drag- ons usually fight for their mates. The females do most of thefighting, flying far and wide to locate a desirable male andthen impressing him with a victory over a rival. Eggs are usu-ally laid near the male’s lair, and the male is left to guard theyoung. Black dragon parents are protective, but give their off-spring little support beyond the occasional bit of advice.Eventually, the parent advises its offspring to leave the areabefore the older dragon decides to eat the youngster. Although capable of breathing underwater, black drag- ons do little actual swimming; instead, they wallow in theshallows, enjoying the feel of the mud or simply lying inwait for prey . Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets,using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heav-ily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in thewater or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit theiraerial maneuverability . When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, andtakes refuge in the deepest water it can find. BLUE DRAGONS Blue dragons are vain and territorial. They favor hot, arid areas.They prefer sandy deserts, but can be found on dry steppesand in hot badlands. A blue dragon guards its territory againstall potential competitors, including other monsters such assphinxes, dragonnes, and especially brass dragons. Blue drag-ons detest brass dragons for their frivolous ways, chaoticalignment, and propensity to flee from battle. Blue dragons prefer vast underground caverns for lairs— the grander the cavern, the better. They often choose lairs atthe bases of cliffs where windblown sand has accumulated. Thedragon burrows through the sand to reach the caves below. Most blue dragons don’t bother to keep the entrances to theirlairs free of sand; they simply burrow to get in or out. Manydeliberately bury the entrances to their lairs before settlingdown to sleep or when leaving to patrol their territory . Dungeon-dwelling blue dragons prefer fairly warm and dry areas with sand or dirt floors. Blue Dragon Identifiers A blue dragon is conspicuous by its dramatic frilled ears anda single, massive horn atop its short, blunt head. The hornjuts forward from a base that takes up most of the top of thehead, and it usually has two points. The primary point isslightly curved and reaches well forward, with a smaller, sec-ondary point behind. Rows of hornlets line the dragon’sbrow ridges, and run back from the nostrils (which lie closeto the eyesockets) along the entire length of the head. A blue dragon has a short snout with an underslung lower jaw. It has a cluster of bladelike scales under its chin, andhornlets on its cheeks. Most of the dragon’s teeth protrudewhen its mouth is closed. A blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowingdesert sands. The size of its scales increases little as thedragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder.Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up staticCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodelectricity . These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. A blue dragon flying overhead is easily distinguished from a brass dragon by its batlike wings, which have shortalar thumbs and a mottled or dappled pattern. The alarphalanges (the fingerlike bones that support the wing; seeInternal Anatomy, page 7) have knobby joints, and thephalanges are all the same length, giving the wings arounded look. The trailing edge of the wing membranejoins the body well ahead of the rear legs. The dragon has a short, thick neck. The head is mostly fea- tureless when viewed from below, but the ears are visible.The dragon’s tail is thick and flat. Habits A blue dragon’s vibrant color makes it easy to spot in barrendesert surroundings, especially when the dragon is on theground. When it wishes to be less conspicuous, a bluedragon burrows into the sand so that only the top of its head is exposed. This trick leaves the dragon’s massive horn stick-ing above the surface, but from a distance the horn tends tolook like a jagged rock. Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Somenearly match the color of the desert sky and can be difficultto see from below. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, blue dragons are most fond of gems—especially blue sapphires.They consider blue to be a noble hue and the most beauti-ful color. Blue dragons are dedicated carnivores. They sometimes eat snakes, lizards, and even desert plants to sate their greathunger, but they especially prefer herd animals such ascamels. When they get the chance, they gorge themselves onthese creatures, which they cook with their lightning breath.This dining habit makes blue dragons a real threat to caravans 39CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by S.

The dragons think of cara- vans as handy collections of food and treasure, allavailable on the same trip. Blue dragons have a highly developed sense of order (with themselves at the top, at least locally). The oldest blue dragonin an area acts as an overlord to all lesser blue dragons livingnearby . This suzerain receives homage from its subjects andsettles any disputes, particularly those involving mates or ter-ritorial boundaries. Although any blue dragon in an area canchallenge the suzerain for the right to rule, this seldom hap-pens. A blue dragon that is unhappy with its suzerain usuallymoves to a new area—either one with a suzerain more to itsliking, or one with no suzerain at all. Blue dragons observe elaborate courtship and mating rit- uals involving exchanges of food and treasure, the consentof the suzerain, and announcements to other blue dragons.Older dragons of either sex might have multiple mates, butinfidelity is rare. Blue dragons are usually attentive and effec-tive parents, and do not often leave eggs unattended. Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet.Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain , in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. When stalkingintelligent prey, they often use ventriloquism and mimicryto confuse and divide groups before closing in for the kill. Ablue dragon runs from a fight only if it is severely damaged,since all blue dragons view retreat as cowardly . BRASS DRAGONS The most gregarious of all the true dragons, brass dragons arefamous (some would say infamous) for their love of conver-sation. They crave sunlight and dry heat, so they frequent hot,arid regions, particularly sandy deserts. Their choice of ter-rain often puts them at odds with blue dragons, which areboth more powerful and more aggressive. Brass dragons usu-ally cope with attacking blues by using their superior speed toescape, either through the air or by burrowing to safety . Brass dragons like to make their lairs in high, rocky caves, preferably facing east so the rising run can warm the rocks.Most brass dragons also have several bolt-holes dug into thebases of cliffs where the desert winds have piled up sand.The dragons burrow tunnels parallel to the cliff face in the hard-packed sand. They can move quickly along these tun-nels, exiting into subterranean caverns, or out other bur-rows farther down the line. Dungeon-dwelling brass dragons often make their lairs near heavily traveled areas where they can satisfy theirdesire for conversation. Brass Dragon Identifiers A brass dragon’s head has a massive, fluted plate sweepingback from its eye sockets, forehead, and cheeks. The one-piece plate is dished like a plowshare. When burrowing inthe sand, the dragon often uses its head like a plow. A brassdragon also sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper withage. It has supple, expressive lips and a long forked tongue.As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyesresemble molten metal orbs. A brass dragon has a tangy odor redolent of hot metal or desert sand. Brass dragons have short, raylike wings that run from their shoulders all the way back past the tips of their tails.The wings get most of their support from long spines run-ning perpendicular to the backbone. The neck is stubby andthick, with a comparatively long body . When the body isviewed from below, the chin horns are visible. At birth, a brass dragon’s scales are a dull, mottled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy untilthey reach a warm, burnished appearance. The wings and frillsare mottled green where they join the body, and have reddishtints at the outer edges. These markings darken with age. Habits Brass dragons can and will eat almost anything if the needarises, but they normally consume very little. They seem tounderstand that the desert is a fragile environment, andthey live lightly upon the land. They are able to get nour-ishment from the morning dew, a rare commodity in thedesert, and they go forth at dawn to gently lift minute beadsof dew off plants with their long tongues. Though it values all precious things, a brass dragon pre- fers organic treasures over cold stone or metal. Its hoardoften includes items made from rare woods, textiles, andCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodother examples of fine handicrafts rendered in exquisite materials. The warm, dry air of its lair helps keep these deli-cate treasures from deteriorating with age. A brass dragontakes great care to keep its fiery breath weapon well awayfrom its delicate treasure, and often keeps its hoard in a sep-arate chamber within its lair. Brass dragons love intense, dry heat and spend most of their time basking in the desert sun. Their territories alwayscontain several spots where they can sunbathe and trapunwary travelers in conversation. A brass dragon will talkfor hours with any creature capable of putting two syllablestogether. Many scholars believe that brass dragons are the most humble of the true dragons. While any brass dragon cer-tainly will agree that humility is among its many virtues, abrass dragon’s loquacity is really a formof draconic hubris. Brass dragons con-sider themselves such gifted con-versationalists that they simplycannot bear to allow any sentientbeing to miss the benefit oftheir company .For all their love of conversation, what brass dragons seem to prefer the least is the company of other brass dragons. Eachone remains in loose contact with its neighbors, and brassdragons will band together whenever a common enemythreatens, but otherwise they keep to themselves. Many brass dragons create vast networks of confidantes and informants, including djinn, jann, sphinxes, and vari-ous humanoids. The dragons use these networks to keepapprised of local events and to stay in remote communica-tion with distant brass dragons. Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelli- gent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversa-tion, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique,using suggestion or a dose of sleep gas. Though basically friendly, brass dragons are quick to act if they feel threat-ened, and often use their nonlethal sleep breath to knock out aggressors. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itselfpinned or buried to the neck in the sand. The dragon then 41CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Brass Dragons by Size Overall Body Neck Tail Body Standing Maximum Minimum Size Length Length Length Length Width Height Wingspan Wingspan Weight Tiny 4 ft. 1-1/2 ft. 1 ft. 1-1/2 ft. 1 ft. 1 ft. 6 ft. 4 ft. 5 lb.

When faced with real danger, younger brass drag- ons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand.Older dragons spurn this ploy but tend to avoid pitchedfights unless they have some tactical advantage. BRONZE DRAGONS Bronze dragons have a strong sense of justice and do not tol-erate cruelty or anarchy in any form. Many a pirate or robberhas faced swift retribution from a bronze dragon using aninnocuous disguise. Bronze dragons also have an inquisitiveside and find the activities of other creatures, particularlyhumanoids, endlessly fascinating. They enjoy polymorphinginto small, friendly animals to study such activities. Bronze dragons like to be near deep fresh water or salt water, and are found in temperate and tropical coastal areasand islands. They often visit the depths to cool off or huntfor pearls and sunken treasure. Bronze dragons wage a constant struggle against evil sea creatures, particularly ones that menace the coasts, such assahuagin, merrow, and scrags. They sometime find them-selves with black or green dragons for neighbors. While thebronzes are content to live and let live, the evil dragons areseldom willing to return the favor. Bronze dragons prefer make their lairs in caves that are accessible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry—they do not lay eggs, sleep, or store treasure underwater. Often,a bronze dragon’s lair has a lower area that floods at high tideand an upper area that remains dry around the clock. Dungeon-dwelling bronze dragons often live near under- ground streams or lakes. Bronze Dragon Identifiers A bronze dragon in its true form can be recognized by theribbed and fluted crests sweeping back from its cheeks andeyes. The ribs in the crests end in curving horns. Thesehorns are smooth, dark, and oval in cross-section, and curve slightly inward toward the dragon’s spine. The largest hornsgrow from the top of the head. In older dragons, the smallerhorns often develop secondary points. The dragon also hassmall horns on its lower jaw and chin. A bronze dragon has a beaklike snout and a pointed tongue. It has a small head frill and a tall neck frill. A bronze dragon has webbed feet and webbing behind the forelimbs. Its scales are smooth and flat. A bronze wyrmling’s scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approachesadulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronzetone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edgesof their scales. Their pupils fade as they age, until in theoldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs. A smell of seaspray lingers about them. When viewed from below, a bronze dragon’s wings show green mottling on the back edges. The trailing edge of thewing membrane joins the body behind the rear legs, at thepoint where the tail meets the pelvis. Most of the alar phalanges are very short and form a wide frill just beyond the alar thumb. The innermost phalange is thelongest, and it provides most of the support for the wings,along with a modified alar olecranon at the “elbow” of the alarlimb (see page 8). This arrangement allows the dragon to useits wings as big fins underwater. A bronze dragon can flap itswings when submerged and literally fly through the water. Habits A bronze dragon spends much of its time in an assumedform, usually that of a small animal or an older humanoid.This charade serves the dragon’s inquisitive nature by allow-ing it a chance to observe the world without drawing atten-tion to itself or disrupting the flow of events. Bronze dragonsvalue moral order and altruism. Bronze dragons frequently congregate with others of their kind, making them among the most gregarious of theCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodtrue dragons. When in their natural form, they sometimes swim or play together in the waves. They gather even morefrequently when using assumed forms, particularly whenobserving some event of interest to them. They find warfarefascinating, and many have served in armies fighting forgood causes. Afterward, they may spend decades debatingthe course of the war, its causes, and its consequences. Though they have no lack of draconic pride, bronze drag- ons enjoy the company of humans and other humanoids.They consider these “lesser” creatures to be just as deservingof survival and happiness as themselves. When in the com-pany of humanoids, a bronze dragon usually assumeshumanoid form, both as a practical matter (it can be veryhard to fit a bronze adult into a seaside cottage), and to keepthe humanoids at ease. Bronze dragons delight in testing astranger’s sense of decency by posing as penniless beach-combers, shipwrecked sailors, or guileless primitives.Unscrupulous creatures who attempt to cheat, bully, rob, orkill a masquerading dragon soon find more trouble thanthey had bargained for when the dragon reveals itself. Crea- tures who conduct themselves well may never know theyhave actually encountered a bronze dragon. Nevertheless,good conduct earns the dragon’s respect, and it is usuallyremembered, perhaps to be rewarded someday . Most bronze dragons maintain a constant watch for pirates, natural disasters, and ships in distress. Many a shipwreckedmariner has been rescued by the timely intervention of abronze dragon. Because bronze dragons usually perform suchrescues while disguised as something else, the beings they saveoften remain unaware of exactly who their benefactor was. Courtship and mating among bronze dragons is always a deliberate and respectful affair. Bronze dragons mate for life,and one often refuses to take a new mate after the death ofthe original mate. They always tend their eggs and offspringcarefully and defend them to the death if necessary . Bronze dragons eat aquatic plants and some varieties of seafood. They especially prize shark meat, and often spenddays at sea hunting sharks. They also dine on the occasional 43CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Bronze Dragons by Size Overall Body Neck Tail Body Standing Maximum Minimum Size Length Length Length Length Width Height Wingspan Wingspan Weight Small 8 ft. 2 ft. 2 ft. 4 ft. 2 ft. 2 ft. 16 ft. 8 ft. 40 lb.

They often keep pearls in their lairs, both as treasures and snacks. They admire other treasures from the sea as well,such as bits of rare coral and amber. Though they don’t careto admit it, their favorite metal is gold, which does not tar-nish in their humid lairs. Bronze dragons usually attack only in self-defense or to defend those unable to defend themselves. They dislikekilling anything they don’t plan to eat, and they try especiallyhard to avoid killing animals that are merely defendingthemselves. They usually try to distract attacking animalswith food, using their repulsion breath to fend them off ifdistractions fail. Against intelligent foes, bronze dragonsusually try to negotiate, but remain wary of duplicity . Often, a bronze dragon figures out a way to be victorious in a conflict without dealing damage, such as stranding a foeon an island or dismasting a ship at sea. COPPER DRAGONS Copper dragons have a well-deserved reputation as incorri-gible pranksters, joke-tellers, and riddlers. They appreciateall forms of humor. Most are good-natured but also have acovetous, miserly streak. Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands and mountains. Their territories sometimes adjoin or overlap brass dragons’territories. The two species tend to get along well, but meet-ings between the two usually devolve into marathon con-versations in which the copper dragons bombard the brassdragons with humor while the brass dragons blithely con-tinue to banter. Such sessions usually end with one dragonor the other taking its leave none too gently .Copper dragons also find themselves with silver, red, or blue dragons for neighbors. The silvers avoid too muchcontact with the coppers. Blue or red dragons inevitably tryto slay the coppers or at least drive them away . Many a copperdragon considers the presence of a blue or red dragon aschallenge, and does all it can to annoy and embarrass theevil dragon without getting itself killed. Copper dragons make their lairs in narrow caves. They use their ability to move and shape stone to enhance theirlairs, often concealing the entrances using move earth and stone shape. Within the lair, they construct twisting mazes, often with open tops that allow the dragon to fly or jumpover intruders. Unlike most dragons, however, copper drag-ons are often happy to have cramped lairs that don’t allowthem space for flight; they depend instead on their ability toclimb stone surfaces for mobility inside the lair. Copper Dragon Identifiers Copper dragons are powerful jumpers and climbers, withmassive thighs and shoulders. A copper dragon’s head has a short face and no beak. Broad, smooth browplates jut over the eyes, and long, flat copperyhorns extend back from the browplates in a series of seg-ments. The dragon also has backswept cheek ridges and frillson the backs of the lower jaws that sweep forward slightly .Layers of triangular blades point down from the chin, and asthe dragon gets older more layers with larger blades develop.The dragon has a long tongue that comes to a single point. At birth, a copper dragon’s scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scalesCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T .

A very old dragon’s scales pick up agreen tint. A copper dragon’s pupils fade with age, and theeyes of a great wyrm resemble glowing turquoise orbs. Copper dragons have a stony odor.Copper dragons have mantalike wings that show green and red mottling along the trailing edges. The upper alar limb isexceedingly short, giving the leading edges of the wings a U-shaped profile when viewed from below. The wings run downthe dragon’s entire body, almost to the tip of the tail. The main portion of the wing is supported by three pha- langes and a modified alar olecranon. Spines sweepingbackward at an angle from the backbone support theremainder of the wing. A copper dragon’s distinctive wing profile makes it easy to distinguish from the brass dragon, which can occupy simi-lar habitats. Habits A copper dragon’s sense of humor compels it to seek outcompanionship—it takes at least two beings to share a joke.Consequently, a copper dragon is basically a social creature.Except when mating, however, copper dragons tend to avoideach other, mostly because they cannot resist getting intocompetition to prove which has the sharpest wit. When twoor more copper dragons get together, the meeting usuallyescalates into verbal sparring. The dragons initially trade wit-ticisms and banter, but the conversation eventually devolvesinto pointed barbs growing ever more vicious, until one of thedragons pulls away, vowing revenge. Such encounters rarely lead to violence or lasting enmity, but often create a rivalry .Rival copper dragons have carried on wars of practical jokesand colorful insults that have lasted for centuries. Copper dragon courtship is an odd mix of tenderness and outrageous humor. Although males and females exchangesmall gifts of food and treasure, the real currency betweencopper dragons is wit. Copper dragons are attracted to mateswho can make them laugh. Such liaisons are never perma-nent, but the couple stays together long enough to raisetheir offspring to adulthood. After that, each dragon’s free-wheeling spirit takes over and the couple splits, with eachindividual going its own way . Copper dragons are known to eat almost anything, in- cluding metal ores. However, they prize monstrous scorpionsand other large poisonous creatures. (They say the venomsharpens their wit; their digestive systems can handle thevenom safely, although injected venoms affect them nor-mally .) They are determined hunters. They consider goodsport at least as important as the food they get, and doggedlypursue any prey that initially eludes them. When building hoards, copper dragons prefer treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites, butthey also value statuary and fine ceramics. A copper dragon would rather tell a riddle or a pull a prank than fight. Any copper dragon appreciates wit wherever itcan be found, and will usually not harm a creature that canrelate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not 45CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwood46heard before. The dragon quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn’t laugh at its jokes or accept itstricks with good humor. Copper dragons love being thecenter of attention and do not appreciate being upstaged. When cornered, a copper dragon fights tenaciously, using every trick it knows to defeat the foe. Copper dragons showsimilar aggression when defending lairs, mates, or offspring.In most other circumstances, a copper dragon prefers tooutwit and embarrass a foe. To a copper dragon, a perfect vic-tory comes from taunting and annoying an opponent intojust giving up. In anysituation, copper dragonsfavor thinking and plan-ning over brute force. Theyoften deal with superior foes,such as red dragons, by draw-ing them into narrow, twistingcanyons or tortuous caves where they can use their climbing ability to outmaneuver the foe. GOLD DRAGONS Gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil and foul play . Theyoften embark on self-appointed quests to promote good.Woe to the evildoer who earns a gold dragon’s wrath. The dragon will not rest until the malefactor has been defeated and either slain or brought to justice. Gold dragons do not settle for anything less than complete victory over evil. A gold dragon usually assumes human or animal guise, even within its own lair. Gold dragons can live any- where, but they prefer secluded lairs. Favorite locales include the bot- toms of lakes, high plateaus, islands, and deep gorges. A gold dragon’s lair isCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodalways made of stone, with numerous chambers, all beauti- fully decorated. The lair usually has loyal guards: animalsappropriate to the terrain, storm giants, or good-alignedcloud giants. Dungeon-dwelling gold dragons choose locations that provide them with suitable chambers. Gold Dragon Identifiers A gold dragon in its true form is easily recognized by itslarge, twin horns that are smooth and metallic, twin neckfrills, and the whiskers around its mouth that look like thebarbels of a catfish. Gold wyrmlings lack whiskers, but theyquickly develop them as they mature. Younger dragons haveeight whiskers, four on the upper jaw and four below. Olderdragons have more. A gold dragon has a short face with spines above the nos- trils. The eyes are slanted and very narrow. Along with thewhiskers, the eyes give the dragon a sagacious look. As thedragon ages, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools ofmolten gold. The dragon has a long, pointed tongue, back-swept tendrils on the lower jaws that develop into frills withage, and cheek horns that jut out sideways. On hatching, a gold dragon’s scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks. The flecks get larger as the dragonmatures until, at the adult stage, the scales grow completelygolden. A gold dragon smells of saffron and incense. A gold dragon has an extremely long tail and broad, mantalike wings that run all the way to the tip of the tail.When at rest, the dragon closes its wings over its back like a massive, golden moth. It folds its wings back when walkingor running. A gold dragon flies with a distinctive rippling motion, almost as if it were swimming through the air. Many scholarsargue that gold dragons are the most elegant flyers of all thetrue dragons (and the gold dragons agree). When viewed frombelow, a flying gold dragon can be distinguished by its long tailand rippling wings. Its whiskers and horns also show. Habits A gold dragon spends most of its time in an assumed form,usually that of a nondescript human or a harmless animalcommon to the area in which the dragon resides. For animalforms, gold dragons often choose domestic animals, such asdogs, cats, or horses, or swift moving but fairly nonthreaten-ing forms such as eagles. As with the bronze dragon, theassumed form allows the gold dragon to travel and observethe world without attracting undue attention to itself. Whentraveling in particularly dangerous areas, a gold dragon usesan especially nonthreatening form. This approach helps set atease fellow travelers the dragon might meet, and also allowsthe dragon to use itself as bait for any evil creatures lurkingabout. Many killers and robbers who haunt the world’s lonelyplaces have met swift ends when their seemingly helplessvictims turned out to be gold dragons in disguise. Gold dragons always seek news of the wider world and local gossip about recent events. Any gold dragon is a good 47CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 48listener, and even the most long-winded talker does not try its patience (though even a gold dragon will draw the line if abrass dragon bends its ear for too long). The dragon usuallyavoids philosophical or ethical arguments with lesser beings,though it often cannot resist trumping an argument thatadvocates chaos with an aphorism or fable promoting law.When it encounters a being that advocates evil, a gold dragontends to be silent, but marks the speaker for future attention. Gold dragons have a worldwide hierarchy with a single leader at the top. This leader is elected by the whole speciesfrom the ranks of great gold wyrms and serves for life oruntil he or she decides to resign. Many serve until the onsetof their twilight (see page 14); others serve until theybelieve a successor can do a better job. The leader is alwaysaddressed by the honorific “Your Resplendence.” When a vacancy occurs, every gold dragon in the world participates in the selection of the replacement, who isalmost always selected by acclamation. Occasionally, twocandidates of equal merit are available when the previousruler dies or retires. In such cases, the two work out somemethod of sharing of office. During the past, there havebeen co-rulers, alternating rulers, and rulers who simplyhave retired early to make way for another. The ruler’s duties usually prove light because the posi- tion’s authority rarely needs to exercised. Most gold dragonsknow how they are expected to behave, and they act accord-ingly . The ruler mostly serves to advise individual gold drag-ons on the nature and goals of their quests against evil. Theruler often can point out hidden consequences for a quest,such as the effects on the politics of lesser creatures or theimpact on the local environment or the balance of power.The ruler also serves as the gold dragons’ chief representa-tive in dealing with other species (in the rare event whensome matter of interest to all gold dragons arises), and aschief enforcer and judge (in the exceptionally rare case ofgold dragon misconduct). Gold dragon courtship is both deliberate and dignified. Often two prospective mates spend years debating philoso-phy and ethics, and go on several quests together, so as to getthe full measure of one another. Once a pair agree to mate,they seek the ruler’s approval as a matter of protocol. Per-mission to mate is rarely withheld.Despite their lawful nature, gold dragons allow them- selves remarkable freedom. Some mate for life, other onlyfor a short time. Some are monogamous, and others havemultiple mates at the same time. Gold dragons always tendand instruct their young carefully, though it is common forparents to send their offspring into the care of foster parents(always lawful good, but not always dragons) when they per-ceive the need. Young gold dragons may be fostered to pro-tect them when danger threatens, to free up the parents fora quest, or simply to broaden their horizons. Gold dragons prefer treasures that show an artisan’s touch. They are particularly fond of paintings, calligraphy,sculpture, and fine porcelain. They enjoy pearls and smallgems, which also are their favorite foods. Approaching agold dragon with gifts of pearls and gems is a good way togain favor, provided the gifts are not offered as bribes. Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When con- versing with intelligent creatures, they use discern lies to help them determine if combat really will be necessary . Theyprefer to delay combat until they can cast preparatory spells. GREEN DRAGONS Green dragons are belligerent creatures and masters ofintrigue, politics, and backbiting. They prefer forests; theolder the forest and bigger the trees, the better. Greendragons are as territorial and aggressive as any other kindof evil dragon, but their aggression often takes the form ofelaborate schemes to gain power or wealth with as littleeffort as possible. Green dragons seek out caves in sheer cliffs or hillsides for their lairs. They prefer locations where the lair’s entranceis hidden from prying eyes, such as behind a waterfall ornear a lake, pond, or stream that provides a submergedentrance. Older green dragons often conceal their lairswith plants they have magically grown. Green dragonssometimes clash with black dragons over choice lairs. Thegreens frequently pretend to back down, only to wait a fewdecades before returning to raid the black dragon’s lair andloot its hoard. Dungeon-dwelling green dragons prefer locales with some kind of vegetable life, such as grottos filled with giantmushrooms.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Gold Dragons by Size Overall Body Neck Tail Body Standing Maximum Minimum Size Length Length Length Length Width Height Wingspan Wingspan Weight Medium 16 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. 6 ft. 3 ft. 4 ft. 27 ft. 12 ft. 320 lb.

The crest reaches its fullheight just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, just ear openings and leathery plates that run down the sides of the neck, eachplate edged with hornlets. The dragon also has hornlets overits brows and at the chin. The nostrils are set high on thesnout, and the teeth protrude when the mouth is closed. Thedragon has a long, slender, forked tongue. The stinging odor of chlorine wafts from a green dragon.A wyrmling green dragon’s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragonages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades offorest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend inwith its wooded surroundings. A green dragon’s legs and neck are proportionately longer in relation to the rest of its body than any other chromaticor metallic dragon. When it stands on all fours, its bodystays fairly high off the ground, enabling it to pass overbrush or forest debris lying on the ground. The neck is oftenlonger than the rest of the dragon’s body (excluding the tail),and older dragons can peer over the tops of mature treeswithout rearing up. A green dragon’s long neck gives it a distinctive, swanlike profile when aloft. The head looks featureless when viewedfrom below. The wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the lead- ing edges and lighter toward the trailing edges. The alarthumb is short, and the alar phalanges are all the samelength, giving the wingtips a rounded look. The trailingedge of the wing membrane joins the body well ahead ofthe rear legs. Habits A green dragon patrols its territory regularly, both on thewing and on the ground, so as to get a good look over andunder the forest canopy . These patrols serve twin purposes.First, the dragon stays on the lookout for prey . Althoughthey have been known to eat practically anything whenhungry enough, including shrubs and small trees, green dragons especially prize elves and sprites. Second, green dragons like to note anything new happen- ing in their domains. They have a lust for power that rivalstheir desire to collect treasure. There is little a green dragonwill not attempt to further its ambitions. Its favorite meansof gaining influence over others is intimidation, but it triesmore subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragonsor similarly powerful creatures. Green dragons are consum-mate liars and masters of double talk and verbal evasion. Justtalking to a green dragon can lead a being to ruin. When dealing with most other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among theirown kind, they are loud, crass, and generally rude, especiallywhen dealing with dragons of the same age and status.Younger dragons are forced to use some restraint wheninteracting with their elders, but the veneer of civility theyadopt is paper-thin, and the dragons know it. A clear peck-ing order, based on age and status but with no formal hier-archy, develops among green dragons within a given area.Green dragons know each other too well to depend on anyformal social structure. Courtship among green dragons is a coarse and indelicate affair. Once a pair decide to mate, however, their lawfulnature comes to the fore, and a strong bond develops be-tween them. Parents take extreme care to invest their off-spring with all the skills necessary for effective manipulationand double-dealing. A mated pair seldom leaves its first setof offspring untended, but may produce additional clutchesto fend for themselves while the first clutch grows up. Oncethe first clutch reaches adulthood, the parents chase off theyoungsters and go their separate ways. If the pair is aboutthe same age, they divide their shared territory betweenthem. (Such agreements usually last at least a few decadesbefore the former mates seek ways to encroach on eachother’s turf.) Otherwise, the younger parent leaves at thesame time the youngsters do. Green dragons are not picky about the treasure they col- lect. Anything valuable will do. Among items of similarvalue, however, a green dragon favors the item that remindsit of a particularly noteworthy triumph. 49CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwood50Green dragons often attack with little or no provocation, especially when dealing with creatures passing through theirterritory . (Such creatures don’t offer much opportunity for ascam or other long-term manipulation, so the dragon simplyattacks.) Victory in such an encounter often nets the dragonsome treasure and helps demonstrate the dragon’s power toits neighbors and subjects. The dragon typically stalks itsvictims, studying them from afar and planning its assault. Itmay shadow its victims for days before attacking. If thetarget appears weak, the dragon makes its presence knownquickly—it enjoys evoking terror. A green dragon seldomslays all its opponents, preferring instead to try to establishcontrol over one of the survivors by using intimidation ormagical enchantments. It then questions its prisoner to learnwhat is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasurenearby . Green dragons occasionally release such prisoners ifthey can arrange for a ransom payment. Otherwise, the pris-oner must prove its value to the dragon daily or die. RED DRAGONS The most covetous of all true dragons, red dragons tirelesslyseek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exception-ally vain, even for dragons, which is reflected in their proudbearing and disdainful expression. Red dragons love mountainous terrain, but also inhabit hilly regions, badlands, and other locales where they canperch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountain homes often brings them into conflict withsilver dragons, which red dragons passionately hate. Silverdragons usually get the better of red dragons in battle,which merely serves to stoke the flames of resentmentamong red dragons. Red dragons also vie for territorywith copper dragons from time to time, and the weakercopper dragons are often hard-pressed to survive anydirect confrontation. A red dragon seeks out a large cave that extends deep into the earth for its lair. Caves with some kind of volcanic orgeothermal activity are the most highly prized. No matterwhat its lair is like, however, the dragon always has a highperch nearby from which to haughtily survey its territory . Dungeon-dwelling red dragons seek out superheated or fiery areas for their lairs. Since dungeons usually lack ele-vated areas that offer panoramic views of the neighborhood,red dragons living in such places often settle for open spacesor areas with long corridors that offer broad views. Red Dragon Identifiers Two massive horns sweep back atop a red dragon’s head.These horns can be straight or twisted, and can be any huefrom bone white to night black. Rows of small horns runalong the top of a red dragon’s head, and the dragon hassmall horns on its cheeks and lower jaw as well.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by S. W oodA red dragon has a beaked snout with a small nose and chin horns. Its tongue is forked, and little flames oftendance in its nostrils and eye sockets when it is angry . The dragon has fringed ears that tend to merge with the cheek horns as the dragon ages. A red dragon’s teeth pro-trude when its mouth is closed, and it has a single back-swept frill that begins behind the head and runs all the wayto the tip of the tail. The small scales of wyrmlings are a bright glossy scarlet. Toward the end of the young stage, the scales turn a deeperred, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dullfinish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large,thick, and as strong as metal. The pupils of a red dragon fadeas it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemblemolten lava orbs. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon.A red dragon has the longest wings of all chromatic drag- ons, both in actual measurement and in relation to bodylength. This is mostly due to the outermost alar phalange,which is very long and gives the wing a tapering look. Thelongest part of the wing is right at the trailing edge. Thetrailing edge of the wing membrane attaches to the dragon’sbody behind the rear lags and well down the tail. The wingshave a bluish or blue-black tint along the trailing edge (thedragon’s frills show a similar pattern); the color resemblesmetal burned blue in a fire. The great horns on a red dragon’s head are clearly visible from below. Habits Red dragons are so rapacious, ferocious, vengeful, and avari-cious that scholars regard them as the archetypical evil drag-ons. Red dragons share this opinion of themselves. Theybelieve that, above all other species, they are closest to the ideals of draconic nature and behavior, and that the rest ofdragonkind has slipped from this purity . Younger red dragons often find life difficult. Their vivid red scales make them dangerously conspicuous in mostlandscapes, and so they lurk underground by day and ven-ture forth only at night. Older red dragons, however, areboth less vividly colored and more aware of their presumedstatus as the epitome of dragonkind. Red dragons are the most obsessive treasure collectors among the true dragons. They covet absolutely anything ofmonetary value and often can judge a bauble’s worth towithin a copper piece with just a glance. Every red dragon knows the exact value of items in its hoard, along with exactly how and when the dragon obtainedthe item and each item’s exact location in the hoard. Bardstell tales of sneak thieves who ignite a dragon’s wrath just bystealing a single trinket. Such tales are firmly grounded in fact, at least where red dragons are concerned. In some cases, in fact, the tales fallshort of the mark. An adult red dragon can notice a singlecoin missing from its hoard, and its rage over the pettiesttheft is legendary . The dragon tracks down and slays thethief if possible. If not, the dragon is sure to go on a ram-page, killing anything it meets and laying waste to any townor village where the thief might have taken refuge. All red dragons are solitary by nature and fiercely territo- rial; they keep constant watch for trespassers of any kindand for encroachment by other dragons. Entering a reddragon’s territory uninvited is asking to be attacked. For alltheir ferocious independence, however, red dragons alwaysseek to know about events in the wider world. They often 51CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T .

The dragons invariably adopt patronizing attitudestoward these servants, and do not hesitate to slay and eatthem when they bring bad news. A red dragon is particularly interested in news about other red dragons, mostly because its own status relative toits peers remains a top concern. A red dragon’s pride is eas-ily wounded, because any defeat or insult left unansweredcauses a loss of status. This is one reason why red dragons areprone to destructive rages. A red dragon usually can recoversome lost status by wreaking havoc. Every red dragon firmly believes that no being deserves to keep anything it is not strong enough to defend. Reddragons apply this rule to their own kind. Occasionally, reddragons perceive weakness among one of their own, and thesubject is not allowed to live. The victim is attacked, and itslair is stripped. Courtship among red dragons can be a perilous affair, because most would-be suitors are treated as dangerousrivals. Successful red dragon courtship usually involves ayounger dragon with fairly high status among its peerscarefully approaching an older one. Females do most of thecourting, but males are also known to do so. After mating,the younger dragon is usually left to guard the eggs. Mostred wyrmlings are left to fend for themselves. Occasion-ally, two parents of about equal age mate and tend theiryoung together. Red dragons rarely fight for mates. Most are wise enough to know that any battle will be fatal, and prudently quit thefield when a superior rival makes a claim. Red dragons are meat-eaters by preference, and their favorite food is a human or elf youth. Their taste for theflesh of young women is well documented. The dragonssteadfastly claim that such meat simply tastes better. Some- times they force villagers into regularly sacrificing maidensto them. Red dragons are confident fighters for whom retreat or compromise is not an option. They spend years formulatingplans of attack; upon spotting potential foes, they simplychoose a strategy and immediately put it into practice. Beingswift but not particularly agile flyers, they often choose tofight on the ground when they can. There, red dragons oftendisplay considerable mobility and tactical savvy . They areexcellent jumpers, and often leap from place or take shortflights to gain the most favorable position possible whenusing spells or breath weapons. Any red dragon is well awarethat its fiery breath can destroy treasure, and it uses itsbreath weapon judiciously so as to avoid incinerating thespoils of victory . For all its legendary ferocity, a red dragon also knows when not to attack. If it recognizes a superior foe, it (reluc-tantly) withdraws to fight another day if it can do so withoutlosing face. Likewise, when dealing with a clearly weakerfoe, a red dragon might attempt to bully or fool the creatureinto rendering it some service or supplying information. Ineither case, the dragon gets what it wants, or the creaturedies. The dragon will accept no other outcomes. Red dragons do not slay every foe they meet in battle. Always conscious of status, they often allow a few survivorsto escape and spread word of the dragon’s victory .CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS SILVER DRAGONS Silver dragons enjoy the company of humanoids and often take the form of kindly old men or fair damsels. Theycheerfully assist good creatures in genuine need, but usu-ally avoid interfering with other creatures until their assis-tance is requested or until inaction would allow somethingevil to come to pass. They hate injustice and cruelty, thoughthey concern themselves less with punishing or rooting outevildoers than with protecting the innocent and healingtheir hurts. Though they can be found nearly anywhere, silver drag- ons love high mountains and vast, open skies with billowingclouds. They enjoy flying and sometimes soar for hours justfor the pleasure of it. Silver and red dragons often come into conflict. This is only partly because they lair in similar territories. Silverdragons despise red dragons for their love of carnage andpenchant for destruction. Duels between the two varietiesare furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get theupper hand, usually by working together against their foes,and often by accepting assistance from nondragons. Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks or amid the clouds themselves. A cloud lair always hasan enchanted area with a solid floor for laying eggs and stor-ing treasure. Silver dragons often dwell in towns or in dungeons. When doing so, they typically take a humanoid form and blend inwith the rest of the population. They always situate them-selves near one or more open areas where they have space toassume their true forms when necessary .Silver Dragon Identifiers A silver dragon in its true form can be recognized by thesmooth, shiny plate that forms its face. The dragon also hasa frill that rises high over its head and continues downthe neck and back to the tip of the tail. A silver dragon hasthe tallest frill of any metallic or chromatic dragon. Longspines with dark tips support the frill. The dragon also hasear frills with similar spines. It has two smooth, shinyhorns, also with dark tips. A silver dragon has a beaklike nose and a strong chin with a dangling frill that some observers say looks like a goatee.It has a pointed tongue. A silver wyrmling’s scales are blue-gray with silver high- lights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowlybrightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible.From a distance, these dragons look as if they have beensculpted from pure metal. As a silver dragon grows older, itspupils fade until in the oldest the eyes resemble orbs of mer-cury . A silver dragon carries the scent of rain about it. When viewed from below, a flying silver dragon shows a remarkably similar profile to a red dragon. It has long wingsthat are broadest along the trailing edge. The wing mem-brane attaches to the dragon’s body behind the rear legs andwell down the tail, and the head has clearly visible horns. Thewings also show darker markings along the trailing edges,just as a red dragon’s do. Fortunately, a silver dragon has oneminor feature that sets it apart from a red dragon: The outeralar phalange forms a second “thumb” at the leading edge ofthe each wing. Viewers unable to discern the dragon’s colorwould do well to look for this vital detail. 53CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T .

Silver dragons do so tomore readily associate with humanoids. Some scholars maintain that silver dragons prefer the company of humans or elves to that of other silver dragons.As with most things draconic, the truth is more complexthan that. Silver dragons believe themselves to be superiorto most other beings, just as other kinds of dragons do.Unlike other dragons, however, silvers believe that being adragon imposes some limitations. Many of these are practi-cal in nature, such as their massive size and the huge livingspace requirements that go along with it. What concerns silver dragons the most, however, is the draconic sense of time. They’re happy to live more than2,000 years, but they constantly fight their tendency toreflect on things and let opportunities pass them by . Theyunderstand that short-lived races such as humans must seizeevery opportunity that comes their way, which gives them adrive toward accomplishment that most dragons lack. Silverdragons seek to couple their own long perspective on theworld with humanity’s dynamism. It’s a lesson silver drag-ons believe other dragons would do well to learn. Though lawful and good, silver dragons have no great love for hierarchies and formal authority . They believe thatliving a moral life involves doing good deeds and taking no actions that bring undeserved harm to other beings. Actionsthat cause no harm are not their business. Silver dragons arehardly pacifists, however, and they are quick to battle otherbeings who would do evil or harm the innocent. They usu-ally do not take it upon themselves to root out evil, as goldand bronze dragons tend to do. Silver dragons find that, intime, evil tends to make itself felt almost everywhere, andthey seek to stamp it out whenever it appears in their vicin-ity . Should they discover widespread evil looming over theland, however, they are both willing and able to locate itssource and tackle it there. Silver dragons form loosely knit family units or clans with a matriarch or patriarch (called the “senior”) presiding.The senior gives advice, settles disputes, and coordinatesany actions the clan might take as a group. A clan of silverdragons can be spread over an entire continent, with theindividual dragons in it establishing their own lairs and oth-erwise going about their business. Individual silver dragonsmight go for decades without associating directly withother clan members, but the clan takes care of its own and isalways available to provide support or advice. A silver dragon living among nondragons often develops strong attachments to its nondragon companions. Whensuch a companion earns the dragon’s trust, the dragonCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwoodmaintains the relationship for as long as the companion lives, and may pick up the relationship with the compan-ion’s descendants. A silver dragon always eventually revealsits true nature to a trusted companion. This honesty re-lieves any pangs of conscience the dragon may have aboutdeceiving its companions. It also prevents any awkward-ness that may develop if the dragon has to ask some specialfavor of a companion, such as taking care of the dragon’sabode while it embarks on some venture that might takedecades to complete. Courtship and mating among silver dragons is always a civilized and decorous affair. They always seek mates out-side their own clan—mating within the clan is a serioustaboo. Either sex can initiate courtship. When two silverdragons agree to be mates, they seek the approval of theseniors from both clans. The approval is largely ceremo-nial, and is rarely withheld (never without good reason).Many silver dragons mate for life, but not all do so. Oncea courtship is completed, one of the pair leaves its clanand joins the mate’s clan. Usually, the younger dragon orthe dragon of lower status is the one to change clans, butthis is not always so. Silver dragons are dedicated omnivores and always seek a variety of foods. Many prefer human fare and exist on itexclusively for years without suffering any ill effects.Though many silver dragons have favorite dishes, theyseldom pass up the chance to try something new. Silver dragons prefer portable treasure that they can keep with them while living among humanoids. They especiallyprize items that show exceptional workmanship, every-thing from carefully cut gems to intricate carvings to tex-tiles and jewelry . Silver dragons are nonviolent and avoid combat except when faced with evil or aggressive foes. Often theyremain in their assumed forms and attempt to quickly endbattles using their spells and magical abilities. Whenfighting in their true forms, they prefer to remain air-borne, and they use any clouds in the area to concealthemselves and to take advantage of their cloudwalkingability . No matter who or how they are fighting, silverdragons usually seek to eliminate the leader or the mostaggressive foe first, in hopes of persuading the survivors to surrender or retreat. WHITE DRAGONS The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of thetrue dragons, white dragons prefer frigid climes—usuallyarctic areas, but sometimes very high mountains, especiallyin winter. Mountain-dwelling white dragons sometimeshave conflicts with red dragons living nearby, but the whitesare wise enough to avoid the more powerful red dragons.Red dragons tend to consider white dragons unworthyopponents and usually are content to let a white dragonneighbor skulk out of sight (and out of mind). White dragons’ lairs are usually icy caves and deep sub- terranean chambers that open away from the warmingrays of the sun. Dungeon-dwelling white dragons prefercool areas and often lurk near water, where they can hideand hunt. White Dragon Identifiers A white dragon’s face expresses a hunter’s intense andsingle-minded ferocity . A white dragon’s head has a sleekprofile, with a small, sharp beak at the nose and a pointedchin. A crest supported by a single backward-curvingspine tops the head. The dragon also has scaled cheeks,spiny dewlaps, and a few protruding teeth when its mouthis closed. When viewed from below, a white dragon shows a short neck and a featureless head. Its wings appear blunted at thetips. The trailing edge of the wing shows a pink or bluetinge, and the back edge of the wing membrane joins thebody near the back leg, at about mid-thigh. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and byvery old age, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed inwith the white. Habits A white dragon will consume only food that has been frozen.Usually a white dragon devours a creature killed by itsbreath weapon while the carcass is still stiff and frigid. It 55CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by T . Lockwood56buries other kills in snowbanks within or near its lair until they are suitably frozen. Finding such a larder is a good indi-cation that a white dragon lives nearby . White dragons love the cold sheen and sparkle of ice, and they favor treasure with similar qualities, particularlydiamonds. White dragons spurn the society of others of their kind, except for members of the opposite sex. They are prone tocarnal pleasures and often mate just for the fun of it. Theyseldom tend their eggs, but they often lay their eggs neartheir lairs, and one or both parents allow the youngsters tomove in for a time. The offspring are expected to care forthemselves, but they gain some measure of protection andeducation from having their parents nearby . It would be a mistake to consider a white dragon a stupid creature. Older white dragons are at least as intelligent ashumans, and even younger ones are much smarter than predatory animals. Though not known for their foresight,white dragons prove cunning when hunting or defendingtheir lairs and territories. White dragons know all the bestambush spots for miles around their lairs, and they areclever enough to pick out targets and concentrate attacksuntil one foe falls, then move on to the next foe. White drag-ons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft orbursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose theirbreath weapons, then try to knock out a single opponentwith a follow-up attack. Although they are not pillars of intellect, white dragons have good memories, especially for events they have wit-nessed or experienced directly . They remember any slight ordefeat and have been known to conduct malicious vendet-tas against beings or groups that have offended them.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Illus. by S.

DRAGONS IN THE CAMPAIGN It’s no coincidence that the name of the game is DUNGEONS \u0026D RAGONS :Dragons are iconic figures in the fantasy genre. Dragons appear at every Challenge Rating from 1 through28 (or higher, with templates), meaning that it’s quite likelycharacters will face them regularly throughout theircareers. For some campaigns, it’s enough to have dragonscrop up as tough encounters in dungeons and wildernesstreks. For other campaigns, spending some time to deter-mine what role dragons will play in the campaign can berewarding for the DM and players alike. DRAGONS AS MONSTERS There’s nothing wrong with dragons being no more spe-cial or important than any other monster in the Monster Manual, at least as far as your campaign structure is con- cerned. Using this book will help you ensure that anencounter with a dragon is always memorable, but it neednot be anything more than that—a tough fight your players will talk about for months, but not the turn-ing point of the campaign. If dragons are “just monsters” in the campaign, they often appear as climactic encounters in dun-geons, frequently as wandering encounters in thewilderness, and only rarely as the major motivatorsbehind adventures or campaign themes. Dragonsoften appear as secondary villains, the cohorts,allies, or even minions of greater, often humanoid,masterminds. As brilliant as they can be, dragonsrarely appear as masterminds themselves. Here are some possible adventure hooks to get characters involved with one or more dragonsas monsters: • A dragon is terrorizing farmland and devour- ing livestock, and must be stopped. • A dragon demands tribute from a nearby village. • A dragon has made its lair in a wilderness area formerly inhabited by other monsters,which are now moving in on civilized territoryto escape the dragon. • A good dragon disguised as a human needs help to find a magic item stolen from its hoard. • An evil dragon is holding a paladin for ransom. 57Illus. by J. J arvis58• A blackguard with a dragon cohort is tyrannizing a city . • An epic villain has acquired one of the Orbs of Dragon- kind and is marshaling an army of dragons to lay waste to a nation. Some of these hooks are almost clichés of the fantasy genre, but even clichés can be satisfying experiences forplayers, especially newer ones, who enjoy the triumphantfeeling of having vanquished a dragon. DRAGONS AS PLOTTERS AND SCHEMERS A campaign that features dragons as more than “just mon-sters” highlights their great intelligence and the unhurriedperspective that comes from having a life span of fifteencenturies or more, portraying dragons as plotters andschemers. In such a campaign, dragons often work behindthe scenes, generating adventure seeds less through theirdirect actions and more through the actions of their min-ions, agents, and allies, and the plans they set in motion.Dragons in such a campaign command the respect theydeserve—not just from the player characters, but fromNPCs as well, from commoners to aristocrats. They usethat respect to build networks, lure minions, recruit agents,collect tribute, and evolve powers beyond their usual phys-ical and magical abilities. In their role as plotters and schemers, dragons often appear as masterminds whose plans set adventures or shortcampaign arcs in motion. Dragons are usually primary vil-lains, with nondragon monsters and NPCs in the roles ofsecondary villains and minions. Sample adventure hooks involving dragons as plotters and schemers might include the following: • A thieves’ guild in a major city is run by a polymorphed dragon. • An evil dragon replaces a good cleric with one of its doppelganger minions. • A dragon’s bugbear minions start demanding a toll from anyone crossing a well-traveled bridge. • A dragon’s agents sow discord between two human nations, hoping to provoke war.• A dragon allows certain items to be stolen from its hoard, knowing them to be cursed. • An evil dragon tries to frame a good dragon for its own evil deeds, then entices adventurers to slay the supposed villain. • A powerful green dragon sends its gang of half-dragon children to find the Green Orb of Dragonkind before someone else does. DRAGONS AS MOVERS AND SHAKERS In some campaigns, dragons are even more central forces—not only masterminds whose plans set adventures in motion,but the rulers of kingdoms, the patrons of adventurers, andthe moving forces behind entire eras of history . Dragons inthese campaigns are the objects of awe, terror, and rever-ence, the movers and shakers of the campaign world. Theirintelligence, long life span, and sheer power make them themajor powers of the campaign world. In some campaigns,they may even replace outsiders such as demons, devils, andcelestials as the standard bearers of their alignments and thechampions of the deities. In their role as movers and shakers, dragons rarely appear as random or trivial encounters. A dragon encounter isalways laden with significance. Sample adventure hooks involving dragons as movers and shakers might include the following: • A great wyrm who rules an evil kingdom mobilizes its forces for war against a neighboring kingdom ruled by agood dragon. • A dragon cleric of Bahamut hires (or commands) adven- turers to retrieve a draconic relic stolen by the followersof Tiamat. • Worshipers of Tiamat begin a series of rituals designed to bring their goddess to the world. • A disguised evil dragon acts as patron to the characters, sending them on adventures with no apparent connectionto each other, all with a hidden purpose: to collect the piecesof a shattered artifact. • A good dragon leads a rebellion against an evil dragon that rules a kingdom as a tyrant.CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS",

RUNNING A DRAGON ENCOUNTER Dragons are a nightmare in combat—sometimes as muchfor the DM as for the players and their characters. Theypossess such an extensive array of attack options, specialabilities, and even movement capabilities that they can bebewildering to play . This section deals with issues of move-ment (including aerial combat) and hard mathematicalanswers to questions such as “Should the dragon incinerateLidda and Jozan, or tear Tordek limb from limb?” THE MECHANICS OF MELEE As a dragon gets larger, not only does it gain additional HitDice, better natural armor, and increased ability scores, itgains new physical attack forms. As a result, a dragon’s tacticsare necessarily dependent, at least to some extent, on its size. Table 2–1: Expanded Dragon Space and Reach summa- rizes the information presented in Chapter 1 for each kindof dragon. Tiny dragons have a problem. To start with, they have only three natural attacks, with average damage (assuming threehits) of 6.5 points—most Tiny dragons don’t even have aStrength bonus going for them. Getting in three hits is dif-ficult for them, however. Though they can bite adjacent foes,their claws have no reach. Making a full attack, then, meansentering an opponent’s square, provoking an attack ofopportunity in the process. Most Tiny wyrmlings prefer tostay out of the reach of opponents and use their breathweapons as often as possible. Like Tiny dragons, Small dragons have only three natural attacks. However, their average damage is better—9.5 pointsof damage, including a +1 Strength modifier on the biteattack—and, more important, their bite and claw attackscan reach adjacent opponents. They need never enter anopponent’s square to make a full attack. Even so, most Smalldragons are better off using their breath weapons, employ-ing their good speed to remain out of harm’s way while straf-ing their foes with breath attacks. Medium dragons gain the ability to make attacks with their wings, increasing their average damage (again,assuming five hits) to about 22.5 to 23.5, depending on the dragon’s Strength bonus. A Large dragon has reached its maximum number of nat- ural attacks, six, with the addition of a tail slap. With six suc-cessful attacks, a Large dragon can dish out an average of45.5 to 54.5 points of damage, or as many as 65.5 on averagefor red and gold dragons because of their higher Strengthscores. Large dragons also gain 10 feet of reach (with alltheir attacks except their claws), which greatly reduces thethreat of attacks of opportunity from smaller opponents.Large dragons are no longer afraid of wading right into thethick of melee, though they try to keep as many opponentsas possible at neck’s length (the reach of their bite attack),even if it means sacrificing claw attacks. Even Large dragonsalmost always lead off with their breath weapons, however,and if significantly hurt in melee they take to the air andresume their ranged breath attacks. A Huge dragon still has six natural attacks, but now all of them have reach—including 20 feet of reach for its tail slapattack (or more, for some dragon varieties). Few opponentscan close with a Huge dragon without provoking an attackof opportunity . With its impressive reach, a Huge dragoncan easily attack foes spread out all over a battlefield, whichare hard to catch within the area of a single breath weaponattack. Its average full attack damage (assuming six hits) is inthe range of 75 to 86 points of damage (higher for a golddragon). Dragons of this size keep their breath weapons inreserve for those special occasions when their opponentsare clustered together and can all be caught in the breathweapon’s area. A Gargantuan dragon’s. average damage on a full attack that scores six hits ranges from 109 to 118 points, or up to120 or 126 points (for strong red and gold dragons). A Colossal dragon’s average full attack damage is in the neighborhood of 150 points. Dragons of Gargantuan orColossal size fear nothing that is not divine, and are intel-ligent enough to make the best use of their melee attacksand all their other abilities. FIGHTING ON THE WING Most dragons enjoy fighting in the air, even though they arenot necessarily at an advantage when doing so—particularlywhen fighting more maneuverable characters under the effectofflyspells. But the rush of air beneath the wings, the whistle 59CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONSTable 2–1: Expanded Dragon Space and Reach —————————— Reach —————————— Tail Sweep Size Space Bite Claw Wing Tail Slap Radius Tiny 2-1/2 ft. 5 ft. 0 ft. — — — Small 5 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. — — —Medium 5 ft. 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. — — Large 10 ft. 10 ft.15 ft.110 ft. 10 ft.1— Huge 15 ft. 15 ft.110 ft.115 ft. 20 ft.1— Gargantuan 20 ft. 20 ft.115 ft. 20 ft. 30 ft.130 ft.1 Colossal 30 ft. 30 ft.120 ft. 30 ft. 40 ft.140 ft.1 Colossal+230 ft.+ 40 ft.130 ft. 40 ft. 60 ft.160 ft.1 1 As an optional rule, certain dragon varieties, because of their body proportions, can exceed or fall short of these numbers.

The greatest limitation of a dragon fighting on the wing is its maneuverability . Only Tiny and Small dragons haveeven average maneuverability, which forces them to moveat least half their flying speed (50–75 feet) forward everyround and prevents them from turning more than 90degrees in a single move. Of all dragons, Tiny and Smalldragons are most likely to attempt aerial combat in rela-tively close quarters—as long as they have at least 10 feet inwhich to maneuver, they can fly back and forth or even in acircle to fight opponents on the ground. A portion of the Flight diagram below shows a Small dragon making a 180-degree turn. It moves forward 5 feetand turns 45 degrees for free, then “spends” 5 feet of itsspeed to turn an additional 45 degrees in the same space.Then it moves forward another 5 feet, turning another 90degrees in the same way . It has actually covered only 10 feetof distance, while using 20 feet of its movement. Medium, Large, and Huge dragons have poor maneuver- ability . Like smaller dragons, they must move at least halftheir flying speed (75–100 feet) forward every round. Theycannot turn more than 45 degrees in a single space or climbat more than a 45-degree angle, and they have to fly at least20 feet to make a 180-degree turn. A dragon of this size won’tattempt to fight on the wing unless it can move througha rectangular area at least 20 feet wide (for a Mediumdragon) or 30 feet wide (for a Huge dragon) to maneuver,and at least as long as the dragon’s fly speed. An area of this size allows a dragon to make strafing runs against creatureson the ground. A portion of the Flight diagram below shows a Medium dragon making a 180-degree turn. Poor maneuverability doesn’t allow the dragon to turn more than 45 degrees ina single space, so it makes a wider turn. It moves forward5 feet while turning 45 degrees, moves 5 feet on the diag-onal while turning another 45 degrees, continues another 5 feet and turns another 45 degrees, then moves alonganother diagonal, which counts as 10 feet (for the seconddiagonal), and completes the turn. It uses 25 feet of its speedto make the turn. The Strafing Run (Poor Maneuverability) diagram on the next page shows a Medium dragon’s path back and forthalong a 20-foot wide chasm, using Flyby Attack to harry oppo- nents on the ground while it flies. Assuming the dragon has a speed of 150 feet, it has two options: It can fly slowly whilemaintaining its minimum forward speed of 75 feet, makingone run past its opponents each round and ending betweenruns on the location marked 75. Alternatively, it can fly atfull speed, make two runs past its opponents (though it canonly attack once), and end where it began, in position to dothe same pattern in the next round. Gargantuan and Colossal dragons have clumsy maneuver- ability, though their flying speed is tremendous. They alsomust move at least half their flying speed (100–125 feet)forward every round. Their turning radius is even larger:They must fly at least 40 feet to make a 180-degree turn.Dragons this enormous won’t engage in aerial combat unless 61CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS Poor Maneuverability (Medium dragon) Average Maneuverability (Small dragon)Wingover5 251015 20 180˚ turn \"costs\" 10 feet of movement25 feet of movement used, 15 feet of distance traveled510 15 25forward 5 feet, turn 45˚ 25 feet of movement used, 25 feet of distance covered 510 1520one square = 5 feet 20 feet of movement used, 10 feet of distance traveled 90˚ turn \"costs\" 5 feet of movementFlight Poor Maneuverability (Medium dragon) Average Maneuverability (Small dragon)Wingover5 251015 20 180˚ turn \"costs\" 10 feet of movement25 feet of movement used, 15 feet of distance traveled510 15 25forward 5 feet, turn 45˚ 25 feet of movement used, 25 feet of distance covered 510 1520one square = 5 feet 20 feet of movement used, 10 feet of distance traveled 90˚ turn \"costs\" 5 feet of movementFlight 62the available space is twice as wide as they are (60 feet for a Gargantuan dragon, 120 feet for a Colossal one). The Clumsy Maneuverability diagram below shows a Gar- gantuan dragon making a 180-degree turn. It must move 10feet before it can turn 45 degrees. It starts out forward for10 feet and turns 45 degrees. It then crosses two diagonals(15 feet) before turning another 45 degrees. It goes straightanother 10 feet and turns another 45 degrees, then crossestwo more diagonals (15 feet) to finish the turn. It uses 50 feetof its speed to make the turn, whipping its enormous bodyaround behind it as it flies. (In this diagram, the movementis all counted using one square of the dragon’s large space—the one right next to its head, near the center of its front face.The results are the same whichever square you use.) The Wingover feat is a tremendous improvement to any dragon’s maneuverability, allowing it to make a 180-degreeturn in a single space at the cost of 10 feet of speed. In thissingle aspect, the dragon’s maneuverability is the equivalentof perfect when it uses this feat. A portion of the Flight dia-gram on the previous page illustrates a Medium dragonusing the Wingover feat in the course of moving 15 feet ofits normal movement, at the cost of 25 feet of speed. Flyby Attack is an all-but-essential feat for dragons, for it makes the “strafing run” possible. Using this feat, a dragoncan start flying, use its breath weapon against creatures onthe ground even in the air near its flight path, and continueflying, keeping out of reach. It can remain out of reach untilits breath weapon is ready to use again, then return foranother run. Without Flyby Attack, the dragon must makeits attack either before or after it moves, which gives itsopponents too much opportunity to catch up. A dragon’s rapid fly speed (two to four times as fast as a wizard with a flyspell cast on herself, and up to six times asfast as a heavily armored fighter with fly) makes it easy to remain out of reach of most opponents. A dragon that startsits turn 100 feet south of its opponents can fly right overtheir heads, use its breath weapon on them, and then(assuming it has Flyby Attack) continue on to a point 100feet north of them. Lightly armored opponents (with a flyspeed of 60 feet) could get within 40 feet and cast a spell,or could charge and attack the dragon once. More heavilyarmored characters can’t even get that close. The strafingrun certainly isn’t a foolproof tactic for dragons, but it is avery good one. USING A BREATH WEAPON A dragon’s breath weapon has its point of origin at any posi-tion along the outside of the dragon’s space. From there, itcan extend in any direction, including back into the dragon’sspace. All dragons are immune to the effects of their ownbreath weapons, so there is nothing preventing a dragonfrom targeting creatures in its own space with its breathweapon—after crushing them, for example. The Cone-Shaped Breath Weapons diagram on the next page illustrates the size and shape of cone-shaped breathweapons on a grid with 5-foot squares. After using its breath weapon, a dragon must wait at least a few seconds before it can use it again. Under normal cir-cumstances the delay is 1d4 rounds, but the Recover Breathfeat shortens that time, while the application of metabreathfeats extends it. A dragon always knows how long it mustwait before using its breath weapon again, and plans its tac-tics accordingly . If a dragon is engaged in strafing runs overa landbound group of opponents, it knows that it can flyaway for half the time until it can breathe again. Then it canturn around and still reach its foes again just as its breathCHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS one square = 5 feet150 1401351305101520253035404550556065 75 80 85 90 95 100 110 120105 115 125Strafing Run (poor maneuverability) one square = 5 feet150 140 1351305101520253035404550556065 75 80 85 90 95 100 110 120105 115 125Strafing Run (poor maneuverability) Clumsy Maneuverability (Gargantuan dragon) one square = 5 feet50 feet of movement used, 50 feet of distance traveled.forward 10 feet, turn 45˚ 5101525 3035 40 50Clumsy Maneuverability (Gargantuan dragon) one square = 5 feet50 feet of movement used, 50 feet of distance traveledforward 10 feet, turn 45˚ 5101525 3035 40 50weapon is ready for another use. Similarly, it can throw itself into melee for a few rounds; then, in the round before it canuse its breath weapon again, it can make a single attack andchange position to make best use of its breath weapon thenext round. As a rule, dragons are observant enough to notice if their opponents are not suffering the full effects of their breathweapons. After a single blast of its breath weapon, a reddragon has a good idea of who among its foes is warded withprotection from energy (fire) and who has improved evasion .If its breath weapon is clearly ineffective against most of itsopponents, any dragon is smart enough to change its tacticsor even withdraw. TO BREATHE OR NOT TO BREATHE? A breath weapon is a dragon’s most fearsome attack, but it isnot always the most effective. Depending on the foes andthe circumstances, using a breath weapon may or may notbe the best option. The essential difference between a breath weapon and any combination of melee attacks is that total melee dam-age is a fixed amount, while total breath weapon damagedepends on the number of creatures caught in the breath’sarea. A Colossal dragon might dish out an average of 150points of damage with a full attack action, but it has thechoice of either dealing all that damage to one target ordividing it among up to six targets. A Colossal silver greatwyrm can deal an average of 108 points of damage withits icy breath, but it deals the same damage to a dozen tar-gets caught in its 70-foot cone as to a single target. If itcatches ten targets, it has the potential to deal 1,080 points of damage (reduced by the possibility of successful savingthrows and evasion)—and still have time to move, eitherto line up its targets before breathing again or to fly outof reach. At the simplest level, this difference means it’s almost always better for a dragon to use a breath weapon than tomake melee attacks when facing more opponents than thedragon has natural weapons. Surrounded by two dozen mili-tia soldiers, a Large red dragon can likely incinerate themall with a single blast of fire, while it would take 4 rounds tokill them all with melee attacks (assuming every attack wasa successful kill). Of course, the fact that the breath weaponis more efficient doesn’t always mean that it’s preferable—an evil dragon completely unconcerned by the militia sol-diers’ nonmagical spears might enjoy spending the 4 roundsplaying with her food. Faced with a choice of standard actions, using the breath weapon is almost always a better option than making asingle melee attack. Even if it’s impossible to target morethan one foe, the breath weapon will deal more damage, onaverage, than the bite. The only situation where this is evena close call is if the single target in question is a rogue, monk,or other character with evasion. In such a case, breathing isonly marginally better than biting—and it’s a small enoughmargin that the dragon might be better off saving its breath.If the single target has improved evasion, breathing actuallybecomes a worse choice than biting. If a dragon can aim its breath weapon to catch more than one foe, there’s no question about which kind of attack to 63CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS CC one square = 5 feetCone-Shaped Breath W eapons80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80CC 15 1515 1515 1515 1520 20 20 20 20 2030 30 3030 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 3040 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 4050 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 5060 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 6070 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 7070 70 70 70 70 7070 70 70 70 70 80 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8080 80 80 8015 1515 1515 1520 2020 20 20 30 30 30 3030 30 30 30 3030 3030 30 40 40 40 4040 40 40 4040 40 4040 40 40 40 40 4040 40 50 50 50 5050 50 50 5050 50 50 5050 50 50 5050 5050 5050 50 50 50 60 60 60 6060 60 60 6060 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 6060 60 one square = 5 feetCone-Shaped Breath W eapons64make—the breath weapon always deals superior damage against multiple foes when compared to the bite. Faced with a choice between using a breath weapon and making a full attack on one or more foes, the choice issomewhat less clear. For a Medium or smaller dragon, thebreath weapon is still a better option. For a larger dragon,the choice depends largely on how many foes it can catchwith its breath weapon. If it could only breathe on onefoe, it will deal more damage by making a full attack. If itcan catch two or more foes in its breath weapon, breathingis a better choice. Using a breath weapon is almost always a better option than using an area-damaging spell. The saving throw DCagainst a great wyrm’s breath weapon is 10 to 15 higherthan the save DC of its highest-level spells, and the dam-age potential is better as well. A bronze great wyrm thatcasts delayed blast fireball deals 19d6 points of damage with a saving throw DC of 25. The dragon is better served usingits breath weapon (damage 24d6, save DC 37). A 20th-levelrogue has a decent chance of failing her saving throwagainst the dragon’s breath, but will most likely succeedagainst the delayed blast fireball . All this logic begins to break down, however, when a dragon is facing enemies prepared to fight, particularly ifthe foes are expecting a dragon of a certain variety . Once aspellcaster casts protection from energy on the whole party, warding them against the dragon’s breath weapon, thebreath option becomes much weaker. However, even thisdepends on circumstances. If the dragon uses Flyby Attackto strafe its enemies with itsbreath weapon while stayingmostly out of reach, two orthree blasts witha breath weapon are likely to wipe out most protection from energy spells. Spells can be a valuable alternative to the breath weapon in cases where opponents are protected by magic. Adven-turers facing a white great wyrm are likely to be wardedagainst cold, but they’re less likely to be expecting the chain lightning spell the dragon has in its repertoire. Most often, though, the lower saving throw DC greatly reduces theeffectiveness of a dragon’s spells compared to what its breathweapon can do. A dragon is best off using spells to alter theconditions of the fight in its favor, as discussed in Dragonsas Spellcasters, below. USING SPECIAL ATTACK FORMS Compared to the effectiveness of a breath weapon for aHuge or larger dragon, the big dragons’ special melee attackforms—crush and tail sweep—are almost insignificant,though still perilous for those that get in the way . Both tac-tics are commonly used by confident, even cocky dragonsthat feel quite sure of victory, and less often by more cau-tious dragons. The use of the tail sweep, in particular, isoften likened to the way a cat treats a mouse it isn’t quiteready to eat yet. Both the crush and the tail sweep are, ineffect, area melee attacks.",

        "description":  "A crush attack can be quite fearsome, particularly because of the lingering effects of being pinned. Followthese steps to resolve a dragon’s crush attack. 1) If the dragon is on the ground when it begins the attack, it makes a Jump check. The dragon must achieveenough vertical distance with the jump to clearthe heads of the creatures it wants to crush. Table 2–2: Jump DCs to Crush Opponents shows the Jump DCs required for a dragon (with a land speed of either 40 or 60 feet) to reach the required height with either a standing high jump or a running high jump. If the dragon is flying, no Jump check is required; it simply lands on the opponents it wants to crush. 2) Determine how many creatures are in the target area. The crush attack affects any creatures located completelywithin the dragon’s space when it lands: a 15-foot-by-15-foot square for a Huge dragon, a 20-foot-by-20-foot square for a Gargantuan dragon, or a 30-foot-by-30-foot square for a Colossal dragon. 3) After the dragon lands, each creature in the target area must roll a Reflex saveagainst a DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon.CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONSIllus. by S. T appin This Colossal gold dragon’s tail sweep scatters a band of hobgoblins like matchsticks.Creatures that succeed on their saving throws take half the dragon’s crush damage. They remain in their spaces—because the dragon is at least three sizes larger than they are,they can occupy the same space as the dragon. Creaturesthat fail their saving throws take full damage and arepinned. Roll the crush damage once and apply the result (orhalf of it) to each affected character. Pinned characters cannot move. They take a –4 penalty to their Armor Class against all opponents other than thedragon, but they are not helpless. 4) On its turn, a pinned creature may try to escape. A character that makes a successful opposed grapple check(as a melee attack) or Escape Artist check (as a standardaction) is no longer pinned but is still grappling with thedragon. If a character makes two successful opposedchecks against the dragon, the character has escaped thegrapple entirely . 5) On the dragon’s next turn, it can choose to maintain the pin or to release pinned characters. If it tries to maintain thepin, it makes a single grapple check opposed by grapplechecks made by all pinned opponents. Creatures who beatthe dragon’s grapple check take no damage, while othercreatures take the dragon’s full crush damage. If the dragondecides not to maintain the pin, it can act normally, withoutregard to the creatures that share its space (since they arenecessarily at least three sizes smaller than it is).",

        "description":  "When making a tail sweep attack, a dragon chooses half of the area it threatens with its tail slapattack—a semicircle with a radius of 30 feet if it is Gar-gantuan or 40 feet if it is Colossal (more for certain dragontypes, notably gold and white, with their longer tails). Crea-tures within that area are affected if they are four or moresizes smaller than the dragon—Small or smaller for a Gar-gantuan dragon, Medium or smaller for a Colossal dragon.Affected creatures take the dragon’s tail sweep damage(including 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus), or half thatamount if they make a successful Reflex save against a DCequal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon. Roll the tailsweep damage once and apply the result (or half of it) toeach affected character. Two feats, described in the next section of this chapter, can enhance a dragon’s tail sweep. Whirlwind Tail Sweepallows the dragon to affect a circular area rather than asemicircle, while Tail Sweep Knockdown knocks proneany characters who fail their saving throws. DRAGONS AS SPELLCASTERS It is both a recognition of the limitations of dragons’ innatespellcasting ability and a testament to their incrediblecombat prowess that, as a rule, a dragon’s physical attacksand breath weapon are more effective than its spells. In gen- eral, a dragon casts spells as effectively as a sorcerer somefive to eight levels lower than its Challenge Rating, so thatmost dragons are not the spellcasting equals of the charac-ters they typically fight. This fact means, among otherthings, that a dragon’s offensive spells are rarely effective ina combat against equals, as useful as they may be in terroriz-ing villagers. The saving throw DCs for a dragon’s spells areeasy for a character to make if his or her level is about thesame as the dragon’s CR. A dragon’s best use of spells is toalter the conditions of the fight in its favor, rather thandirectly targeting characters who will succeed on theirsaving throws most of the time. Dispel magic is a good way to remove the carefully pre- pared protections and wards that most adventurers cloakthemselves in before venturing to fight a dragon. Unfor-tunately for the dragons, the disparity between their casterlevel and their opponents’ levels makes dispel magic a long- shot gamble. The dispelling breath spell (see page 78) is a slightly better option than dispel magic: It lets the dragon use its breath weapon and make a targeted dispel attemptagainst every creature that fails its saving throw against thebreath. The dragon’s caster level check is still going to behard to make, but the dragon will get more chances to rollhigh and dispel some of the opponents’ protection. Everysuccessful dispel check is one more factor adjusted in thedragon’s favor. Altering the battlefield is another way of adjusting condi- tions in the dragon’s favor. With its array of special abilitiesand immunities, a dragon’s best strategy is to create condi-tions that hinder its opponents without hindering itself—at least not as much. A dragon’s blindsense is perhaps its single best quality for this purpose. Blindsense gives a dragon a distinct advantageover characters who rely on sight (whether regular vision ordarkvision), and a smart dragon maximizes this advantageby using spells that impair its opponents’ vision, such asdeeper darkness . Dragons certainly enjoy seeing their foes’ expressions of dismay, and want to be visible to inspire theproper amount of terror in their opponents, but in a toughfight, swathing the battlefield in magical darkness is func-tionally equivalent to greater invisibility . Even a minor spell such as obscuring mist orfog cloud hin- ders a dragon’s foes while imposing no obstacle to its blind-sense, and thus offers the dragon a distinct advantage. Otherfog spells, such as stinking cloud, cloudkill, and incendiary cloud, add injury to insult by dealing damage (or inflicting nausea)in addition to restricting vision. Along the same lines , solid fog limits opponents’ mobil- ity while granting a dragon concealment.

A dragon’s energy immunity can also work to its benefit in conjunction with spellcasting. A red, brass, or golddragon can easily attack through a wall of fire, taking no impairment or damage, while forcing opponents to weatherthe flames to reach it. This tactic can wear down protection from energy spells that ward the dragon’s foes. Perhaps the most dramatic means of altering the condi- tions of the battlefield is the antimagic field spell. Most dragons can function just fine in an antimagic field, though sacrificing their breath weapon is a difficult choice. Adragon’s full attack against a character with no magical pro-tection is simply devastating, and the complete protectionfrom hostile magic offered by the field is worth the loss ofthe dragon’s own spells, spell-like abilities, and even super-natural abilities (including its breath weapon and damagereduction). Dragons particularly favor this tactic whenfaced with opponents who are well prepared to exploittheir energy vulnerability . Of course, the most direct way for a dragon to give itself an advantage in combat through spellcasting is to cast spellson itself that enhance its abilities. Bull’s strength and bear’s endurance are obvious choices for any dragon. Many dragons also favor cat’s grace, improving their average Dexterity score so they gain +2 to Armor Class and +2 on Reflex saves. Eagle’s splendor can give a slight boost to a dragon’s spell and spell- like ability saving throw DCs, and also makes its frightfulpresence that much harder to resist. Dragons love haste, and not just for the extra (often sixth!) attack it gives them when making a full attack. A +1 bonuson attack rolls is often just that much more cushion forusing Power Attack, since dragons rarely have much diffi-culty hitting their foes. A +1 bonus to Armor Class is alwayswelcome, and increasing a dragon’s speed by 30 feet makesit outpace every opponent that much more. Dragons who have access to the cleric spell list (including blue and red dragons, as well as all metallic dragons) alwayslearn cure spells, and learn heal when they can. Few events can wipe the self-confident smirks off player characters’ faceslike seeing a dragon who was sorely wounded suddenlyrecover more than 100 hit points! Strange as it seems, dragons sometimes learn flyand cast it on themselves before entering battle. Relying on magic tofly reduces a dragon’s speed significantly, but increases itsmaneuverability drastically . Particularly when faced withhumanoid foes that are airborne through the same means, adragon is often willing to trade speed for the ability to hoverand turn on a dime. Other dragons prefer spells and featsthat improve their maneuverability, however. DRAGON FEATS In addition to general feats (such as those described inChapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook ), this book introduces a new kind of feat, the metabreath feat, and contains infor-mation on epic feats (from the Epic Level Handbook ) and monstrous feats (from Savage Species ).EPIC FEATS These feats are available to characters of 21st level or higher. Dragons of at least old age also can choose these feats evenif they have no class levels. A selection of epic feats appro-priate for dragons is presented here. See the Epic Level Hand- book for more epic feats. METABREATH FEATS Dragons (and other creatures) have developed ways to con- trol their breath weapons to produce varying degrees ofeffects, from the subtle to the conspicuous. To take a meta-breath feat, a creature must have a breath weapon whosetime between breaths is expressed in rounds. Therefore, ahell hound (which can breathe once every 2d4 rounds) cantake metabreath feats, whereas a behir (breath weaponusable 1/minute) cannot.",

Forexample, a Small dragon with a line-shaped breath weaponcould use Enlarge Breath twice on the same breath.

DRAGON SPELLS Over the millennia, dragons have developed a number of spells that take their special abilities and qualities intoaccount. Despite the origin of these spells, any spellcastercan learn and use them if he or she is capable of castingspells of the indicated class and level. METABREATH SPELLS Similar to the metabreath feats described in the previoussection, a large number of spells in this section alter adragon’s breath weapon. While metabreath feats allow mun-dane manipulation of a breath weapon’s shape or power,metabreath spells represent significant magical enhance-ment of the breath weapon. A metabreath spell has a specialbreath (B) component listed in the spell description. Usingthe breath weapon is a part of casting the spell, just likemaking a touch attack is a part of casting a touch spell.Unlike touch spells, a dragon cannot hold the charge on ametabreath spell; it must breathe as part of the spellcasting. Casting a metabreath spell counts as a normal use of a breathweapon, and the dragon must wait the normal length oftime before using it again. A spellcaster must have a breath weapon to cast a spell with a breath component. Some metabreath spells apply only tobreath weapons with a damaging, energy-based effect—so adragon turtle’s scalding breath (which deals damage withno energy descriptor) or a gorgon’s petrifying breath ,for example, could not be animated with animate breath. Either could be enhanced with fire damage using breath weapon admixture or replaced with electricity damage using breath weapon substitution. A character under the effect of an elixir of fire breath can use metabreath spells normally . SORCERER/WIZARD SPELLS 1st-Level Sorcerer/Wizard Spells Trans Breath Flare.

Amulet of Supremacy (Minor Artifact): This stun- ning piece of jewelry is virtually priceless based simply onits artistic quality and the value of precious metal and gem-stones it contains, but its magical abilities are even morevaluable to a dragon. When worn by a dragon, an amulet of supremacy confers the benefits of the Maximize Breath feat on the dragon’s breath weapon, and applies the effects ofthe Maximize Spell feat to the dragon’s spells and spell-likeabilities. These benefits come at no cost to the dragon: Itneed not wait extra rounds between uses of its breathweapon, and its maximized spells do not use higher-level spell slots. An amulet of supremacy bestows two negative levels on any nondragon that dares to put it on. In addition, when a non-dragon first dons the amulet, it immediately targets theoffender with a disintegrate effect (caster level 20th, Forti- tude DC 19 partial).

The breath weapon works justlike the nondamaging effects of a metallic dragon. A brassdraught creates a cone of sleep, a bronze draught creates a cone of repulsion gas, a copper draught creates a cone of slow gas, a gold draught creates a cone of weakening gas, and asilver draught creates a cone of paralyzing gas. The savingthrow against the metallic breath weapon has the same DCas the drinker’s natural breath weapon, and the effects arethe same as if the drinker used the breath weapon normally . For example, an old red dragon that drank a gold draught of metallic dragon breath could breathe a cone of weakening gas that deals 8 points of Strength damage. A character under the effects of a potion of fire breath or similar effect can use a draught of metallic dragon breath to alter the fiery blasts from that potion, using the caster levelof the effect (3rd, in the case of a potion of fire breath) as the effective age category .

        "description":  "A bloodscaled fury gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Fearsome Presence (Ex): A bloodscaled fury is a terror to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart in-spires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragon’s frightfulpresence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC toresist the ability is increased by the dragon’s class level. Crea-tures with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 the dragon’sclass level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws,while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both feareffects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6). Draconic Fury (Ex): At 2nd level, a bloodscaled fury’s rage becomes more fearsome. While raging, its Strengthand Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 pointsand it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves.Thus, an 11th-level barbarian/2nd-level bloodscaled furygains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on itsWill saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at –2.) At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level blood-scaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scoresand +6 on its Will saves. Scales of Blood (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a blood- scaled fury earns its name. When it enters a rage, smallquantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining theiredges and adding to the dragon’s fearsome appearance.More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragonfrom spells and weapon damage. For the duration of thedragon’s rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level,and its damage reduction improves as well. The numberbefore the slash in the dragon’s damage reduction increasesby 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled fury’sdamage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold ironweapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons.For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gainsdamage reduction 15/magic while raging. At 7th level, itgains damage reduction 15/magic and cold iron whileraging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epicand cold iron while raging.Rend: At 4th level, a bloodscaled fury gains Rend (see page 73) as a bonus feat, even if it doesn’t have the prerequisites. Extended Fury (Ex): At 5th level, a bloodscaled fury can remain in a rage for a number of rounds equal to 6 + itsCon modifier. Incite Rage (Ex): At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters arage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet,granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 moralebonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves,and a –2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragonremains raging. This ability is otherwise identical tonormal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end ofthe rage. Tireless Fury (Ex): At 9th level, a bloodscaled fury no longer becomes fatigued at the end of its rage. Blinding Speed (Ex): A 12th-level bloodscaled fury can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 12 rounds each day . The duration of the effect need not be con-secutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action. Ex-Bloodscaled Furies A bloodscaled fury that becomes lawful loses all class fea-tures and cannot gain more levels as a bloodscaled fury .

W eapon and Armor Profi- ciency: A dragon ascendant gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Awesome Aura (Ex): A dragon ascendant loses its in- nate frightful presence, replac- ing it with a special fear aura. This aura surrounds the drag- on at any radius it chooses up to the extent of its frightful presence (30 feet ×the dragon’s age category), and is always ac- tive unless the dragon chooses to deactivate it. The dragon can choose to exclude its own allies from the effect of its aura. Creatures within the aura must make a Will save (DC equal to the dragon’s frightful presence DC plus 1/2 its dragon ascendant levels). Creatures that fail their saving throws are shaken, while those that succeed are immune to the effect of that dragon’s aura for 24 hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken crea- tures must attempt a second Will save (same DC) orbecome frightened. 91CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS Illus. by J.

All allies of the dragon within the radius of itsaura receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, andchecks. The dragon’s foes must succeed on a Will savingthrow or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. When a dragon ascendant reaches 10th level, it gains a third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected crea-tures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fas-cinated awe, if they fail their Will saves. As with the fearaspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its alliesfrom the effects of the aura. All uses of a dragon’s awesome aura are mind-affecting effects. Hit Point Increase (Ex): At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a dragon ascendant gains 1 hit point perHit Die it possesses, including all its dragon Hit Dice andthose gained from class levels. This benefit can never in-crease a dragon’s hit points above the maximum for its HitDice and Constitution bonus. At 12th level, a dragon ascendant’s hit points are equal to the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus. Transmutation Immunity (Ex): At 3rd level, a dragon ascendant gains immunity to polymorphing, petrifica-tion, and any other attack that would alter its form. Anyshape-altering powers or spells the dragon has work nor-mally on itself. Increased Damage Reduction (Su): At 4th level, a dragon ascendant’s damage reduction can be overcome onlyby epic weapons. At 8th level, the amount of the dragon’sdamage reduction (the number before the slash) is increasedby 5. For example, an ancient black dragon/8th-level dragonascendant has damage reduction 20/epic. Lifewarding (Ex): At 6th level, a dragon ascendant is no longer vulnerable to attacks that cause energy drain, abilitydrain, or ability damage. Deflection Bonus (Su): At 7th level, a dragon ascendant gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to itsCharisma bonus, if any . Iron Mind (Ex): At 9th level, a dragon ascendant be- comes immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compul-sions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). Resistance to Fire (Ex): At 11th level, a dragon ascen- dant gains resistance to fire 20, if it does not already possessimmunity to fire. Spell Resistance (Ex): At 11th level, a dragon ascen- dant’s spell resistance increases to 33. Immortality (Ex): A 12th-level dragon ascendant is actu- ally a quasi-deity, and can no longer die from natural causes.It does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.

ELEMENTAL MASTER Dragons are creatures of raw elemental power. Two mighty forces rage within their veins: the energy that powers theirbreath weapons, and the elemental nature that forms the coreof their being. Elemental masters strive to attain the purityof perfect attunement with both of these forces. The path of the elemental master is almost exclusively pursued by true dragons, since the class requires a connec-tion to elemental and energy forces. Some dragons havelevels in other classes, commonly wizard or sorcerer, beforeadopting this prestige class, but many others do not. Elemental masters are the most solitary and reclusive of dragons, spending their lives in communion with the natu-ral forces of the universe rather than interacting with crea-tures they consider to be lesser life forms. When they docooperate with other creatures, they choose elementals andoutsiders from the elemental planes as their allies, and occa-sionally younger dragons of the same variety .",
