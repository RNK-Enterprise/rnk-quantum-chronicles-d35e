        "description":  " A musty stench greets you as you emerge from the waterfall into a cave behind it. A sheet of water roars over the mouth of the cave, spraying a fi ne mist into the air. A brown bear the size of a man stands motionless on its hind legs at the other side of the cave. Deeper in, the cavern widens and rises into a larger cave above and behind this one. Varikov stuffed a smallish brown bear (B) and posed it erect on its hind legs near the entrance of the cave to frighten unwelcome visitors. When the PCs get close enough to make out details of Varikov’s appearance, read the following text: This dwarf’s face is twisted in a lunatic rage, his mouth contorted in a sadistic smile. He wears a chain shirt and swings an axe in each hand. A necklace of teeth hangs around his neck, clattering as he moves—and clearly including human teeth as well as more bestial fangs. Varikov’s Tactics Varikov’s darkvision allows him to see almost all of the large cavern from his position at the workbench. If he hears intruders, he blows a soft whistle to Farkash and slowly, quietly moves toward the rope bridge across the chasm while drawing and loading his crossbow. He fi res at the fi rst PC to enter the cave, then draws his waraxe and charges across the bridge. Varikov uses his Surge of Malevolence ability on his fi rst melee attack. Varikov and Farkash coordinate their attacks, using fl anking and trying to maneuver foes into the chute trap or the chasm. Both fi ght to the death. If 82 Varikov fi nds himself adjacent to Farkash, he casts magic fang on his companion. 22HH RREETTNNUUOOCCNNEE Varikov the Trapper CR 7 HP 45 ___________________________________________________ Male dwarf ranger 4/rogue 3 CE Medium humanoid Init +2; Senses darkvision 60 ft.; Listen +11, Spot +11 Languages Common, Dwarven, empathic link AC 18, touch 12, flat-footed 16; +4 against giants HD 7 Resist +2 on saves against poison, spells, spell-like effects; evasion Fort +7 (+9 against poison), Ref +9, Will +0 Speed 20 ft.

His bestial nature grants him a +2 bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks, while imposing a –1 penalty on other Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks. The constant presence of demonic voices whispering in his mind has sapped his will, imposing a –3 penalty on Will saves. These adjustments are included in the numbers above.

That fact means that the PCs (or most of them) can’t get across the opening by making long jumps (PH 77), since a certain amount of vertical space is necessary for this tactic to succeed. For an added level of diffi culty, have Varikov cut the ropes holding up the bridge once he has charged across the bridge into the eastern chamber—now, in order for the PCs to get to Varikov’s inner sanctum without negotiating the chasm, they need to take the southern passage and risk exposing themselves to the chute trap. 83 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR HH22 Farkash CR — HP 13 ___________________________________________________ Wolf animal companion N Medium animal Init +2; Senses low-light vision, scent; Listen +3, Spot +3 AC 14, touch 12, flat-footed 12 HD 2 Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +1 Speed 50 ft.

If it can steal a PC’s essence, either by using a touch attack against a PC with few hit points left or by incapacitating a foe with its ego whip and using a standard action to steal that char- acter’s essence, it does so in preference to attacking another character. It employs its most powerful abilities (its spell-like abilities usable three times per day) against characters who seriously anger it, either by using tricky maneuvers or deal- ing more than 20 points of damage with a single attack. 85 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR II11 F A EATURES OF THE REA",

When the PCs fi rst enter the chapel, they face no immedi- ate danger. They can explore the room, examine the Icon of Ravenloft, and search the body on the altar. Depending on circumstances, they might even begin a long vigil to awaken the powers of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind or the Sunsword, or to qualify for the knight of the raven prestige class. ENCOUNTER DEVELOPMENTS Depending on the results of the Fortunes of Ravenloft, Strahd might encounter the PCs in this area. If the For- tunes of Ravenloft call for this encounter, Strahd attacks the fi rst time the PCs enter the chapel, as they explore the area. If the PCs are performing a ritual or holding a vigil, Strahd enters the area during this process and attacks when the PCs least expect it. Strahd (S on the map) begins the encounter in his were- bat form, perched on the balcony (K28) above the chapel fl oor. He enters K28 in gaseous form, completely silently. Because he is 50 feet above the ground, he is cloaked in darkness or (at best) shadowy illumination from whatever light source the PCs are using (see page 90), though dark- vision can reach up to his position. Characters who have a chance to see him must still make a successful Spot check against his Hide check (+14), as he crouches for cover on the balcony.

Despite its similarity to amorphous creatures like the gibbering mouthers that accompany it, the shapeless spawn is susceptible to critical hits and sneak attacks. DEVELOPMENT The shapeless spawn enjoys its relationship with Strahd and has no wish to see that relationship severed. The creature sees the player characters as a threat to its goals. Whether Strahd is in the room or not, the shapeless form decides that the threat the PCs present to its goals must be eliminated. STRAHD’S TACTICS If Strahd is present with the shapeless spawn, his behavior is completely erratic. He acts as if confused; roll every round to determine his actions unless he was attacked on the pre- vious round. If Strahd is attacked, he attacks the creature that most recently attacked him in the following round. He cannot attack the shapeless spawn, regardless of the result of the dice roll. Strahd remains in his feral form for the entire encounter. His behavior does not change until he is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point he assumes gaseous form and retreats to his crypt. d% Strahd’s Behavior 01–10 Attack creature nearest the shapeless spawn 11–20 Act normally 21–50 Babble incoherently 51–70 Cower as far as possible from shapeless spawn 71–100 Attack nearest creature (not shapeless spawn) T M D ACTICAL AP ETAILS Details of the tactical map are described in the previous version of this encounter (pages 136–137).

This is a ranged touch attack that deals 1d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 18 Fort save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Improved Grab (Ex) If a mouther hits a Medium foe with a bite attack, it can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. Swallow Whole (Ex) A mouther can attempt to swallow a grappled opponent of Medium size or smaller by making a successful grapple check. Once the victim is inside, the mouther can use its blood drain ability. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 5 points of damage to the mouther (AC 19). Its body can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, or 8 Tiny creatures. Blood Drain (Ex) A swallowed opponent takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round. This ability does not affect elementals, plants, or creatures that lack a Constitution score.

After rummaging around his desk for an instant, Lief produces a greatsword and begins swinging it wildly around his head. There is an obvious maniacal gleam in his wide, unblinking eyes. THE MONSTERS The undead creatures are deathlocks, the animated corpses of spellcasters. Skeletally thin and draped in cloaks fringed with magical sigils, deathlocks’ cadaverous eyes sizzle with cursed power. A deathlock prefers to use its spell-like abili- ties from a distance, and often uses its infl ict minor wounds ability to heal itself. ENCOUNTER TACTICS In combat, Lief fi ghts like a raging barbarian, hitting as hard and fast as he can. The deathlocks use cause fear once each, then try to hang back out of melee combat and use 140 their magic missiles. They resort to using their bite attacks only when absolutely no other option remains. If a deathlock is ever adjacent to an unconscious PC, it uses death knell on that target. 0033KK RREETTNNUUOOCCNNEE Lief Lipsiege CR 8 HP 92 ___________________________________________________ Male tainted raver (human) aristocrat 3/fighter 6 CE Medium humanoid Init +1; Senses blindsense 30 ft.; Listen +6, Spot +6 Languages Common, Draconic, Giant AC 15, touch 14, flat-footed 14 HD 9; Fast healing 3 Immune confusion Fort +12, Ref +5, Will +10 Speed 30 ft.

In this state, the raver gains a +4 bonus on its Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to Armor Class (included in the statistics above). An effect that counters rage, such as the calm emotions spell, temporarily suppresses this ability and negates these bonuses and penalties. Unlike a barbarian’s rage, a tainted raver’s perpetual fury does not prevent it from taking actions that require reasoned thought or concentration. A tainted raver can cast spells, use skills, activate magic items, and even act calmly and rationally. Madness (Ex) A tainted raver is irretrievably mad. It uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier and has immunity to confusion and insanity effects. Anyone targeting a tainted raver with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and has its depravity score increased by 1d3 points from that contact. (Ignore this effect if you are not using the taint rules). A tainted raver cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a miracle or wish spell. If restored to sanity, a tainted raver loses this template and all the modifiers it applies. 9955339933772200__CChh0044__EEnncc..iinndddd 114400 77//2266//0066 77::5500::2211 PPMM TALKING TO LIEF Lief is possessed by a murderous insane rage, but it is possible to talk to him.

How this encounter plays out depends on what the PCs did before getting here. If the PCs ring the bell in the belfry (K40), the two cheliceras (marked as C on the map) descend from above to attack them. (See also the “special effect” on the next page). If the Fortunes of Ravenloft reading indicates that Strahd can be found in the treasury (K41), then the encoun- ter begins when the PCs open the secret door into the treasury (S1) and fi nd him there, in his feral form. Strahd then summons the chelicera to his aid. If the PCs do not ring the bell and the Fortunes of Ravenloft reading did not indicate Strahd’s presence in the treasury, there is an encounter here only if Strahd decides to attack. In this case, he fi rst orders the cheliceras to attack. He then emerges in his “werebat” form from out of the bell rafters one round later to join the fray (starting in the square marked S2 on the map). If the PCs come to the treasury to perform a bonding ritual, regardless of any other potential encounters, Strahd attacks them at some point during the process. He makes this attack when they are totally engaged and least expect- ing it, appearing out of the shadows in his feral form to rattle them and then disrupt the ritual. MONSTERS",

It’s a gargoyle, but it begins the encounter using its freeze ability so that an observer must make a DC 20 Spot check to notice it is alive. The southern alcove holds a sculpture composed entirely of chains that vary in size and shape, ranging from extremely thin and razor-sharp to thick and mounted with barbs, spikes, and blades. It has a vaguely humanoid shape, but until it begins moving, it is impossible to distinguish it from an inanimate collection of iron.

The chain golem won’t shred the gargoyle or the portrait if it can help it. Also, it won’t follow PCs who leave the landing. It always remains within the confi nes of the landing and alcoves. On its turn, the gargoyle rushes the closest PC and engages with that character to the exclusion of others. Unlike the portrait and the chain golem, the gargoyle follows the PCs to the best of its ability if they attempt to fl ee, attacking until it is slain or it van- quishes the PCs. 149 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR KK4477 Gargoyle CR 4 HP 45 ___________________________________________________ CE Medium monstrous humanoid (earth) Init +2; Senses darkvision 60 ft.; Listen +4, Spot +4 AC 16, touch 12, flat-footed 14 HD 4; DR 10/magic Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +4 Speed ft. 40 ft.(8 squares) Melee 2 claws +6 (1d4+2) and bite +4 melee (1d6+1) and gore +4 melee (1d6+1) Base Atk +4; Grp +6 Special Actions freeze Abilities Str 15, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7 Feats Multiattack, Toughness Skills Hide +7 (+15 when against stone background), Listen +4, Spot +4 Freeze (Ex) A gargoyle passes as a statue when not moving unless observers succeed on a DC 20 Spot check.

In the surprise round, the imps, the redcap, and any PCs who can see invisible creatures get to act. Each imp attempts to use its suggestion power on the same PC (pref- erably a PC with a low Will save such as a fi ghter type, for instance), suggesting the affected PC turn on his com- panions. The redcap delays until after at least one “cat” has had a turn. The redcap begins its fi rst round by fi ring an eldritch stone from its sling.

If any PC steps on the last step adjacent to the fl oor of the northtower room, the circle of death trap triggers. After the trap triggers, apply the results of the trap and roll initiative.

Both can move freely through the webbed areas. The spiders target opponents that have been immobilized (partially or fully) by the webs, trying to poison and further weaken them.

They prefer to concentrate on PCs who have already been poisoned by the spiders, delaying their actions in some cases to do so. AFTER THE BATTLE After the PCs dispatch the monsters, they can search the area. This requires that they clear away the webs (probably by burning them). Under the webs, the PCs fi nd the rotting remains of long-forgotten chests that once held the personal items of the long-dead guards. There is only one item of interest, which is found on a DC 20 Search check. One chest holds half of an untarnished silver key. The word “Key” is etched on it.

It begins by hurling a wave of ropy strands toward the PCs, clogging the hall with sticky webs and trying to capture as many of them as possible. It spends the following two rounds exhausting its web ability to completely envelope the hall. In subsequent rounds, it moves out to attack stuck foes.

The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Web (Ex) An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based and include a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire. Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire. An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web. Skills Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. 9955339933772200__CChh0044__EEnncc..iinndddd 116699 77//2266//0066 77::5533::3366 PPMM K Q IINNGGSSMMEENN UUAARRTTEERRSS Encounter Level 9 Use this encounter with the room entries on page 111.

To remove a melded skin kite through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the skin kite; doing so peels off the creature but also deals 1d6 points of damage to the attached victim.

This encounter begins when the PCs bend low to read the epitaph on the fallen door to Crypt 7, move to enter this crypt, or attempt to open Crypt 8. CRYPT 7 Two wraiths (W) lurk in the shadows of Crypt 7. The spectre Endorovich (S) hides in a secret subcrypt, waiting to emerge to destroy any living creatures that disturb the area. If the PCs disturb this crypt fi rst, the wraiths emerge from the shadows and act in the surprise round. PCs who make a DC 21 Spot check notice the spectral forms and also get to act in the surprise round. On the second round of combat, Endorovich moves through the wall to attack the PCs. Read: The fog swirls and a blast of grave-cold air heralds the arrival of something terrible from the depths of the crypt. You hear an otherworldly voice call out, “Slaves, attend me!” Endorovich waits 1 round so that the PCs become fully invested in the wraith attack. On the second round of combat, he emerges and moves toward any cleric he can see (fi rst choice) or any other obvious spellcaster (second 184 choice). With his energy drain, Endorovich can make enemy spellcasters lose their highest-level spell for each successful negative level he bestows.

Named for the two long, wickedly barbed horns that grow from their heads, they are a menace to any creature they might perceive as food—a category that includes most anything that moves. Their home plane is Acheron, but bonespears have spread throughout the planes and can be found in even the most inhospitable climates due to their natural hardiness. Bonespears resemble large grasshoppers in shape. Their dark, carapaced bodies are 8 feet long, and they stand nearly 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Their heads are capped by a pair of 3-foot-long barbed horns. Only when the creature begins to hunt does it become appar- ent that the horns are not firmly attached to the crea- ture’s head—long sinews connecting the head and the horns enable the bonespear to launch its horns at prey and reel them in to be consumed. Bonespears can sit for days on end, waiting for suit- able prey to wander by. They typically choose barren, rocky places to conduct their hunts, and many bone- spears lair underground.

The true form of a darkweaver resembles a spider in only in the vaguest fashion. Its fleshy, gray-skinned body is divided into two segments, each with four tentacles. Clus- ters of spiderlike eyes cover all sides of its front section, and the underside contains a mouth with deadly fangs. A darkweaver usually walks on all eight tentacles, but it can rear its front section up and move about, which frees its front tentacles to attack foes or manipulate objects.

A creature in the shadow strands has no concealment from creatures within 5 feet.
