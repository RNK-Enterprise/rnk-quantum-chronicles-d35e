CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES See Complete Adventurer TEMPEST The tempest is the point of calm within a whirling bar- rier of deadly blades. Poets use colorful terms such as dancer to describe the movement of a tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this fighting style is not about dancing. Nor is it about impressing anyone—least of all poets. The tempest focuses on learning the ultimate se- crets of two-weapon fighting for a single purpose—the destruction of her enemies. Typically hardy individualists, tempests rarely learn their skills through any sort of formal training. Instead, they master their an though constant application of its disciplines and experimentation on their foes. Similarly, no matter how famous tempests become, it’s rare for them to take on students. Their art, they say, is one that can be learned but never taught. This prestige class is open to all classes and races. Though tempests are rare, every humanoid race has boasted at least a few. Elves make for nimble, clever tem- pests whose dexterity works to their advantage. Dwarves, perhaps because they favor heavy armor and heavy weap- ons, are the least likely characters to become tempests. Even members of the smaller races can find the tempest’s path appealing.",

In addition to the three attacks she already has each round with her off-hand weapon (for Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Greater Two-Weapon Fighting) at penalties of 0, –5, and –10, respectively, she is also entitled to a fourth attack with her off-hand weapon at a –15 penalty (see Table 8–2: Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties in the Player’s Handbook). She loses this special ability when fighting in medium or heavy armor, or when using a double weapon (such as a two-bladed sword). VERDANT LORD Saying the verdant lord has a green thumb is like calling a red dragon a creature with a slight affinity for fire. The verdant lord is the final defender of the Forest. He has left behind the druid’s search for global understanding of nature’s secrets to focus all his energies on the world’s plant life. Elven and half-elven druids are the most likely charac- ters to embrace the role of the verdant lord. Druids of other races, rangers, and the occasional priest of Obad- Hai or Ehlonna have also been known to adopt this prestige class. It’s almost impossible for characters • without such ties to become verdant lords because they have neither the interest in nor the required understand- ing of seeds, saplings, and trees.

HAVOC MAGE Combat magic is usually reserved for spellcasters in the second rank who are content to lob spells as if artillery from behind the cover of front-rank combatants. Not so the havoc mage, who shares as much in common with a fighter as with a wizard. The havoc mage has learned to toss off spells with such reckless abandon that he can fight head-to-head with both sword and spell without incurring the bitter consequences other spellcasters must con- tend with. A havoc mage is interested in maximum carnage in the shortest amount of time, by dint of a quick spell cast where an enemy least expects it. A havoc mage must first learn the ways of arcane magic, so those most likely to take up the sword (to complement the wand) are sorcerers and wizards. These normally sedate characters are drawn to the frenzy of battle, during which a flashing sword can be just as effective in their own hands as a well-timed spell. NPC havoc mages are more likely than other spellcasters to be lone adventurers, since they are adept both at arms and magic. However, the most successful havoc mages are those who join their talents with those of a balanced group of com- batants and spellcasters.",

Abyssal eviscerators speak Abyssal, though they prefer to get their message across through bloodshed. Combat Eviscerators prefer to fight alone or with groups, against tough odds or against foes that are easy to overwhelm, by ambush or in fair contests.

ASPECT All tremble when the deities and archfiends send mani- festations of their personal power onto the battlefield. While the gods usually send creatures from the Outer Planes to assist their clerics, sometimes a patron will send some small por- tion of its own power instead. These living embodiments of the gods’ life force carry on crusades for good or evil. An aspect looks like the archfiend or deity from which it springs (known as the aspect’s “original”). It is only a pale shadow of the original archfiend or deity. Still, a pale shadow of such a mighty being is formidable indeed. You can find descriptions of the original archfiends in Book of Vile Darknessand the original deities in Deities and Demigods. An aspect is the embodiment of a small portion of an arch- fiend’s or deity’s life force. The original’s power is so great that this shred of life force is actually able to take shape as a living creature (or an undead creature, as in the case of an aspect of Vecna).

Black and gold spines jut from its back down the length of its spine. Nagas are intelligent creatures with a variety of magical powers. They are natural masters of those around them, using subtle wards and clever traps to keep intruders from disturbing their peace. The bright naga is a far weaker creature than its better-known kin. It lacks the poisonous bite and the array of spells that are common among more powerful nagas. Some say that bright nagas are evidence of genetic flaws or unfavorable mating choices on the parts of “true nagas.” All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glisten- ing scales and more or less human faces. A bright naga is 15 feet long and weighs about 500 pounds. Its eyes are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light. A bright naga’s gold coloration darkens toward red when it becomes angry. Bright nagas speak Common and Draconic. Combat Given a chance, a bright naga takes advantage of its laby- rinthine lair, drawing enemies into an exasperating combat in which the naga appears, strikes, and disappears over and over again.

Catfolk are territorial nomads of grassy plains, living in tribes segregated by their visual differences—some friendly to each other, others violently hostile. Some of the most plentiful catfolk are those with the charac- teristics of lions—males with their manes braided and hung with charms for luck in battle, and females with their tawny hides, sleek with muscle. Catfolk are sentient, and they wear the accoutrements of civilization, including belts. They can use tools and weapons. Despite their potential for raw power, many catfolk are slim and wiry, preferring weapons to match, such as the rapier. Other tribes of catfolk have characteristics of leopards, tigers, and cheetahs.

They’ll make slaves of any creatures that they can catch and coerce. The equicephs are long-lost remnants of a distant, peaceful civilization. This ancient society maintained the peace by exil- ing its worst criminals to a land across the sea. The equicephs are the descendants of these cruel lawbreakers. They retain the superior intellect and insight of their ancestors, though they apply their gifts to villainy rather than to harmony. Whether the peaceful equiceph society still survives some- where over the horizon or has long ago fallen is a disputed matter of legend. Equicephs speak Common and Sylvan.

(This is slightly different from the rules in the roleplaying game.) MORALE Damage, and the effects of some special abilities and spells, can force creatures to rout. When a creature routs, it breaks and runs, attempting to leave the battlefield. To determine if a creature routs, make a morale save. Roll 1d20 and add the creature’s level, then compare the result to the save’s DC (morale saves always have a DC of 20). If the save result equals or exceeds the DC, the save succeeds. REDUCED TO HALF HIT POINTS When a creature’s hit points drop to half its starting total, it must succeed on a morale save to avoid routing. If a creature has already made a morale save (successful or not) for being reduced to half its hit points, it doesn’t have to make another one. COMMAND AND MORALE SAVES Any creature that is under command can also add the comman- der’s Commander rating to its morale save as a bonus. If a creature making a morale save is under the command of two or more commanders, use the highest Commander rating. A commander can use its own Commander rating or that of another commander, but not both. A commander can always add its Commander Rating to its own morale saves, even when it’s stunned or otherwise unable to command other creatures. FAILING A MORALE SAVE If a creature fails its morale save, it routs. It immediately moves at double speed along the quickest path toward its warband’s exit corner (the square marked “Exit Corner” on the assembly tile its 97 warband set up on). RULES Illus. by D.

Maximum Points by Miniature You can spend up to 20% of your points on multiples of a partic- ular miniature (for example, up to 200 points in a 1,000-point army). A 1,000-point army could have no more than six Hound Archons (31 points each). Include the 20-point additional cost for commanders when determining the points for multiples of a given commander miniature. VICTORY CONDITIONS After deciding on the size of the armies and designing the armies, choose victory conditions. These set the rules for win- ning a battle. DEPLOYING FORCES After choosing starting locations and deciding on victory condi- tions, players deploy their armies. Each player rolls 1d20. Whoever rolls highest decides which player deploys a unit first. The order of play passes to the left. If there’s a tie, the tied players reroll. The player who deploys first places all his or her units on the battlefield within his or her deployment zone (see below). Com- manders attached to units are deployed at the same time the units are deployed. Then the next player places his or her units, and so on, until all units are placed. Deploying Commanders When you deploy a unit, you may deploy an attached commander with it. The only way for a commander to start the battle attached to a unit is to be deployed with it in this way. Determine whether each attached commander is leading from the front or from the rear. (See Commanders for more information about commanders and what it means to be attached to units.) If it’s your turn to deploy and you have deployed all your units, you now deploy all your unattached commanders, one at a time. A player is done once he or she has deployedall units and unattached commanders. 130 :6 RETPAHC ELTTAB SSAM SELUR nippaT.S yb .sullI Mass Battlefield 1 foot 1 foot 4 feet teef 6 Mass Battlefield 1 foot 1 foot 4 feet formed melee unit unformed melee unit unformed ranged unit lone creature commander Two armies deploy on opposite sides of the battlefield.

The army on the right has three formed melee units, with skirmishers to screen them against ranged attacks and to prevent them from being attacked from the sides. Deployment Zone In a two-player battle, you each deploy your army’s units within 12 inches (1 foot) of your starting point along the battlefield edge and no closer than 12 inches to either of the short edges. (If using a smaller play area, players deploy units only within 6 inches of their starting points.) In a multiplayer free-for-all, players set up along the sides as well, spacing themselves evenly around the perimeter. ROUND SEQUENCE Once the battlefield is set and units are deployed, the time for battle is at hand. Follow the round sequence summarized below. 1. Initiative: Each player rolls 1d20 to see who goes first. 2. Determine Number of Phases: Largest number of units divided by 3. 3. Activate Units: Each player completes a phase, in order of play. On each phase, a player can activate up to three units. No unit can be activated more than once in a round. Activated units can move, move and attack, charge, rally, or take some other action. Damaged units may be eliminated or forced to make morale saves. 4. End of the Round: Go back to step 1 to begin a new round. Play continues until victory conditions are met. Let the best army win! UNITS Armies are composed of creatures. Every miniature represents an individual combatant, and these creatures are grouped into units. A unit is always composed of miniatures that have the same name (although a commander may be attached). Therefore, In mass battles rules, creatures do not fight as individuals; they the members of a given unit have the same characteristics, form coherent units that may be led by commanders. A unit including attacks, Armor Class, creature type, and so on. maneuvers as a single entity. Formed units consist of miniatures organized into one or more ranks. They are powerful when they attack head on, but they are slow and are vulnerable to attacks from the side and rear. Unformed units are less powerful in a head-on fight and more likely to break and run, but they’re faster and more maneuverable than formed units. You decide whether a unit is formed or unformed when you deploy it on the battle- field, and you can’t voluntarily change its state afterward. TRAYS For ease of play, you can place miniatures in a unit on a tray. A tray measures 5 inches by 5 inches. The appendix provides three examples you can use. No matter what type of creatures you are fielding, and whether they are in formed or unformed units, the miniatures in any given unit must fit on the standard tray. Even if you don’t use physical trays, the miniatures in a unit must fit into a space that the tray would cover. A tray is a convenience and doesn’t represent a physical object. Thus, if a unit doesn’t completely fill a tray, the empty portion of the tray doesn’t block movement of other units, doesn’t block line of sight or line of effect, and doesn’t prevent an enemy unit from attacking another unit’s side. (The tray of the attacking unit can overlap the unfilled portion of the defending unit’s tray.) FORMED UNITS A formed unit has at least one rank of creatures (a number of miniatures arranged side by side in a row) and possibly several. When a formed unit takes enough casualties that it can no longer support a single rank, it becomes unformed. A single line of creatures at right angles to a rank is referred to 131 as a file.
