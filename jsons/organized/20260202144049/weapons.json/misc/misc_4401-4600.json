From 6th–11th level, doing so allows two extra attacks with the second weapon, once at the highest attack value and once at a –5 penalty. (There’s still a –2 penalty onall attacks.) From 11th level on, doing so allows three extra attacks with the second weapon: once at the highest attack value, once at a –5 penalty, and once at a –10 penalty. (There’s still a –2 penalty on all attacks.) 2 If the ranger’s combat style is archery, as a full attack action, she can make an extra ranged attack at the highest attack value, but all attacks that round take a –2 penalty. From 6th–11th level, the ranger may shoot an additional arrow in the same attack (and can shoot an extra time per 5 points of base attack bonus above +6).

For example, a mixed elven village is 79% elf, 9% human, 5% halfling, 3% dwarf, 2% gnome and 2% half-elf (with no half-orcs). You might decide to switch the percentages of gnomes and dwarves for an elven community. ECONOMICS Although treasure is what’s important to PCs, you should have a fair grasp of the economic system that surrounds the treasure they earn, as well as the prices charged for services, equipment, and magic items. Economics in your campaign doesn’t have to be con- voluted or tedious, but it should at least be internally consistent. If the price of a broadsword in Thorris is 20 gp, it shouldn’t suddenly shoot up to 200 gp without some explanation, such as the flow of metal or ore being cut off, the only smiths in 100 miles all being killed in a terrible accident, or something equally bizarre. Coinage The economic system in the D\u0026D game is based on the silver piece (sp). A common laborer earns 1 sp a day. That’s just enough to allow his family to survive, assuming that this income is sup- plemented with food his family grows to eat, homemade clothing, and a reliance on self-sufficiency for most tasks (personal groom- ing, health, animal tending, and so on). In your campaign, however, the PCs will deal primarily with gold pieces. The gold piece (gp) is a larger, more substantial unit of currency. The main reason why PCs typically receive and spend gold pieces is that, as adventurers, they take much larger risks than common folk and earn much larger rewards if they survive. Many of the people with whom adventurers interact also deal primarily in gold. Weaponsmiths, armorsmiths, and spellcasters all make more money (sometimes far more money) than common people. Spellcasters willing to make magic items or cast spells for hire can make a lot of money, although expenditures of personal power (experience points) are often involved, and the demand for 139 such expensive items is unsteady at best and can be depended on only in large cities.

MYSTIC THEURGE Blurring the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards. Mystic theurges have unparalleled diversity of spells. In time, a mystic theurge can cast almost any spell in the Player’s Handbook. While a mystic theurge doesn’t have the uninter- rupted spell advancement that a cleric, wizard, or sorcerer has, hemakes up for this with versatility. Mystic theurges are often obsessed with magical lore, traveling to the ends of the earth to learn some new arcane secret or divine insight. Because a mystic theurge casts both arcane and divine spells, all members of this class are multiclass spellcasters. Cleric/sorcerers and cleric/wizards are the most common mystic theurges, with druid/sorcerers more rare and druid/wizards almost unheard of. Mystic theurges tend to be fascinated with magic in what- ever form it takes. They’re always on the hunt for powerful magic items and new arcane spells. Those mystic theurges who worship a deity use the power of their spellcasting to further their deity’s agenda.",

Well, the DM has already used Table 3–5: Treasure (page 52), some of the results of which then referred to Table 7–1: Random Magic Item Genera- tion, above (a good reason to always prepare treasure hoards ahead of time). Chapter 3 also contains references to minor, medium, and major magic treasures. Minor magic treasures are fairly meager, medium magic treasures are the most standard (worth about ten to twelve times that of a minor), and major treasures are the greatest of hauls (worth about four times as much as a medium treasure, on average). Follow this procedure to generate a magic item as part of a trea- sure hoard. 1.When Table 3–5 indicates a minor, medium, or major magic treasure, you can use Table 7–1: Random Magic Item Generation to determine the specific type of magic item—such as a scroll, wand, or weapon. Optionally, you can roll d%: On a result of 01–05, refer to Table 7–31: Specific Cursed Items rather than rolling on the standard tables. 2.Refer to the table that corresponds to the type of item indi- cated in step 1.

The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description). You could, in fact, build a shield that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC. For example, a +1 bucklerwith+1 shield spikeswould cost 3,475 gp (15 gp for the basic buckler, 150 to make it masterwork, 1,000 for the +1 bonus to AC, 10 gp for the spikes, 300 to make them masterwork, and 2,000 to make the spikes a +1 weapon). As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effec- tive bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.",
