Do you steep yourself in time-honored stories or intend to make legends of your own? Are you informed about the lessons learned by previous generations or determined to learn from your own mistakes? Do you emulate any historic kobold fi gures or try to set a new standard for other kobolds to follow? MYTHIC ORIGIN While Kurtulmak is reputed to be a mortal ascended to divinity, kobolds credit Io, the Ninefold Dragon, with their creation. It is told that when Io fi rst created true dragons, they were originally immortal gods, less powerful than Io but much like him. To make each one of his creations distinct, Io gave each a different aspect of his personality. These divine dragons rarely got along, pursuing only one goal in common—the acquisition of material wealth. The true dragons quickly realized they lacked the power to manipulate creation in all the ways neces- sary to accomplish their goals, and they petitioned Io for aid. Io, being an impartial god, would not play favorites with his creations and gave each dragon the same choice. He taught them how to create life by giving A kobold engraving depicts Garl collapsing Kurtulmak’s mine up a piece of themselves, but he warned that in so doing, they would permanently be rendered mortal and eventu- From the beginning, Kurtulmak was much larger than any ally die.
