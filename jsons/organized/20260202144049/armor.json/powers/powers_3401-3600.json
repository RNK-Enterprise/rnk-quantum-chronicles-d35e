It doesn’t seem to have a head. Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants. A shambler’s brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body. A shambler is almost totally silent and invisible in its natural surroundings, often catching opponents flat-footed. It may lie par- tially submerged in a shallow bog, waiting patiently for some crea- ture to walk onto it. Shamblers move easily through water as well, and they have been known to sneak into the camps of unsuspect- ing travelers at night. Adventurers tell stories of shamblers moving about during intense electrical storms without so much as flinching from direct lightning strikes. A shambler’s body has an 8-foot girth and is about 6 feet tall when the creature stands erect. It weighs about 3,800 pounds. COMBAT A shambling mound batters or constricts its opponents with two huge, armlike appendages. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a shambler must hit with both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
