They make their home within Fury’s Heart, traveling to Toril when called by servants of the Storm Lord. Clerics of Talos often call windblades to augment the destruction wrought by true believers. A small tribe of windblades is also rumored to be moving around the Sea of Fallen Stars, sticking to regions of high cliffs and peaks around the Inner Sea.

They seek prey together, and together they bring it down. In combat, windrazors make effective use of Flyby Attack, approaching in waves, swooping in, delivering claw attacks, and fl ying away again. This ensures that only foes who ready attacks ever get a chance to strike back in melee, while maxi- mizing the number of windrazors that can attack. The infl uence of their brutal patron deity leads windra- zors to favor full attacks (with the potential for rending) against wounded foes. Otherwise, the creatures linger near an opponent only if it is poorly armored and otherwise easy to hit (not protected by magical effects, for example).
