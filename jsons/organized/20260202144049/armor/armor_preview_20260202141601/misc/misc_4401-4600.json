The resulting metal, called entro- pium, is heavier than iron but can be used to make effective armor. A suit of entropium armor actually shifts as its wearer moves, allowing incredible flexi- bility at the cost of increased weight. Light entropium armor is considered medium and weighs 2 pounds more than normal, medium armor is heavy and weighs 5 pounds more than normal, and heavy armor is simply more so, weighing 10 pounds more than normal. Shields also weigh 2 pounds more than their steel counterparts. The armor check penalty of the armor increases by 2 for Strength-related skills (Climb and Jump) and decreases by 2 for Dexterity-related skills (Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble). The arcane spell failure chance decreases by 10% (to a minimum of 5%), and the max- imum Dexterity bonus increases by +2. Naturally, entropium improves only armors made primarily of metal, including chain shirts, all medium armors except hide, all heavy armors, and steel shields.

You must check again in each round in which you continue to run, and the DC of this check increases by 1 for each check you have previously made. When you fail this check, you must stop running. A creature that has run its limit must rest for 1 minute (10 rounds) before running again. During a rest period, a creature can move no faster than a hustle on the local scale.

If you stay at least 60 feet away from your quarry, you must succeed on a Hide check opposed by your quarry’s Spot check once every 10 minutes. At a distance of less than 60 feet, you must make a Hide check each round and begin operating on the com- bat scale. Extraordinary activities on your part (such as spellcasting or attacking) can disrupt this attempt even if you succeed on the check. Tailing someone still requires cover or conceal- ment, as normal for attempting a Hide check. A moderately crowded street provides suffi cient cover and concealment to accomplish this goal. Alternatively, you can duck between areas of cover or concealment, as described in Move between Cover for the Hide skill (see page 92). Even if you fail a Hide check while tailing someone or you’re spotted while moving too great a distance between hiding places, you can attempt a Bluff check opposed by your quarry’s Sense Motive check to look innocuous. Suc- cess means your quarry sees you but doesn’t realize you’re tailing him; failure alerts him that you’re actually following. A modifi er might apply to the Sense Motive check, depend- ing on how suspicious your quarry is. The following table provides Sense Motive modifi ers for particular situations.
