In a small hollow within the massive tree that the werewolf in elf form was hiding behind, the other werewolves stowed their gear. A DC 15 Search check is sufficient to uncover two additional sets of equipment that are the same as the combat gear and possessions of the werewolf in elf form. “You are the fi rst outsiders we have seen in these woods in many years. We know nothing of any others.” When the werewolves in wolf form get close enough to the PCs, they spring out from the undergrowth and attack—catching them unawares and getting a surprise round’s worth of action. At the same time, the one in elf form looses an arrow. Reusing this Encounter You can reuse this map and these werewolf statistics blocks for later encounters in the Svalich Woods. You should draw or place the map at a different orientation on the table, and have the PCs come from a different direction. The werewolf in elf form makes no attempt to talk to the PCs, but all three circle around the PCs to surround them before attacking. Werewolf Tactics The werewolves do not change form during this encounter. They want the PCs to think that they are up against elves with powerful wolf allies. The werewolves in wolf form try to make good use of their surprise round, charging the nearest PCs and attempting to trip them. In later rounds, they gang up on a single PC (preferring a human target because of their favored enemy bonus), fl anking that character. If their chosen target proves too diffi cult to hit, they switch targets.

Its effects are described in the Energy Drain entry below. Skills Bluff +6, Climb +8, Diplomacy +4, Hide +10, Jump +8, Listen +11, Move Silently +10, Search +8, Sense Motive +11, Spot +11 Fast Healing (Ex) If reduced to 0 hp in combat, a vampire spawn automatically and immediately assumes gaseous form and makes its way toward the catacombs (K84), which it must reach within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. Any additional damage it takes in gaseous form has no effect. Spider Climb (Ex) A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell. Energy Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn’s slam attack gain two negative levels, losing 10 hit points and taking a –2 penalty on skill checks, ability checks, saving throws, and effective level. At the same time, the spawn gains 10 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus on skill checks, ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws for 1 hour. (This bonus derives from its Improved Energy Drain feat, which is described in Libris Mortis.) If the victim is a spellcaster, she loses access to two spells as if she had cast her two highest-level, currently available spells. See DMG 293 for more information about energy drain and negative levels. Blood Drain (Ex) A vampire spawn can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the spawn gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. This ability does not affect elementals, plants, or creatures that lack a Constitution score. Domination (Su) A vampire spawn can crush an opponent’s will just by looking into his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet, except that the spawn must use a standard action and choose a single target— those merely looking at him are unaffected. The vampire’s target must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall instantly under the spawn’s influence as though by a dominate person spell (CL 12th). Gaseous Form (Su) As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (CL 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Its Armor Class in gaseous form is 12, touch 12, flat-footed 10. 9955339933772200__CChh0033__EEnncc..iinndddd 6677 77//2266//0066 77::2266::5522 PPMM N H YYMMPPHH IIDDEEAAWWAAYY Encounter Level 9",

Creatures that are affected by this power or successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the Drowned Lady’s horrific appearance for 24 hours. Evil Eye (Su) Three times per day, the Drowned Lady can cast her dire gaze upon a creature within 30 feet, who must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for three days (remove curse or dispel evil cures). Affected creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or die from fright. This is a fear effect. Perpetual Rage (Ex) A tainted raver is constantly in a state of insane fury similar to a barbarian’s rage. In this state, the raver gains a +4 bonus on its Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to Armor Class (included in the statistics above). An effect that counters rage, such as the calm emotions spell, temporarily suppresses this ability and negates these bonuses and penalties. Unlike a barbarian’s rage, a tainted raver’s perpetual fury does not prevent it from taking actions that require reasoned thought or concentration. A tainted raver can cast spells, use skills, activate magic items, and even act calmly and rationally. Madness (Ex) A tainted raver is irretrievably mad. It uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier and has immunity to confusion and insanity effects. Anyone targeting a tainted raver with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d3 points of taint (depravity) from that contact. (Ignore this effect if you are not using the taint rules.) A tainted raver cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a miracle or wish spell. If restored to sanity, a tainted raver loses this template and all the modifiers it applies. 9955339933772200__CChh0033__EEnncc..iinndddd 7733 77//2266//0066 77::2277::3333 PPMM T C HHEE RROOSSSSRROOAADDSS Encounter Level 8 SIR URIK",

The staircase starts in the catacombs at K84 and spirals upward around a hollow central shaft (K18a) to a point about 10 feet below the main fl oor at K17.

On the kitchen level, a small crack in the outer stairway wall connects the stairway to area K63, allowing gaseous creatures to pass through. K18A.

On his fi rst turn, he takes to the air, swoops down the staircase and bites the nearest PC, remain- ing airborne.
