Although possession of either or both of these supplements will enhance your enjoyment of this book, they are not strictly necessary. 4pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs SOURCES This book includes material from other sources, including Dragon Magazine,  web articles previously published on the Wizards of the Coast website, and earlier publications such as Oriental Adventures  and Tome and Blood.  This material has been picked up and revised to v.3.5 based on feedback from thousands of D\u0026D players comparing and debating the strengths and weaknesses of characters and options at gaming conventions, on message boards, on email lists, and over the counters of their friendly local gaming stores.  Most of the changes we made to previously published material are intended to create an improved version of that material—to help out prestige classes that were formerly suboptimal choices, to adjust feats or spells that were simply too good, or take whatever steps the D\u0026D v.3.5 revi-sion made necessary for each individual class, feat, spell, or item.

        "description":  "Warmages are chosen (or apply) to attend special arcane war colleges. Such colleges are not for the weak of spirit. The rig- ors of both body and mind bear little resemblance to the apprenticeship undergone by regular wizards, or the self-taught fumbling of sorcerers. Warmage colleges are more similar to boot camps sponsored by large nation-states. Throughout their training, warma- ges are forced to wear ponder- ous garments (meant to familiarize their bodies with the limitations of movement in armor) while drilling constantly with spells, most of which are too high in level to be cast by the student. This vigor- ous drilling instills the spells in a war- mage ’s unconscious mind, so that as he grows in power later in life, those spells become available for his use without his needing a spellbook. After their training, warmages share a deep feeling of camaraderie with their fellow students and continue to feel a slight affection for any well-run military out ﬁ t.Ferno, a warmage Table 1 –2: The Warmage Base Attack Fort Ref Will   ——————— Spells per Da y ——————— Level Bonus Save Save Save Special 0 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th  1st +0 +0 +0 +2 Armored mage (light), 5 3 — — — — — — — — w a r m a g e  e d g e  2nd +1 +0 +0 +3 — 6 4 — — — — — — — — 3rd +1 +1 +1 +3 Advanced learning 6 5 — — — — — — — — 4th +2 +1 +1 +4 — 6 6 3 — — — — — — — 5th +2 +1 +1 +4 — 6 6 4 — — — — — — — 6th +3 +2 +2 +5 Advanced learning 6 6 5 3 — — — — — — 7th +3 +2 +2 +5 Sudden Empower 6 6 6 4 — — — — — — 8th +4 +2 +2 +6 Armored mage (medium) 6 6 6 5 3 — — — — — 9th +4 +3 +3 +6 — 6 6 6 6 4 — — — — — 10th +5 +3 +3 +7 Sudden Enlarge 6 6 6 6 5 3 — — — — 11th +5 +3 +3 +7 Advanced learning 6 6 6 6 6 4 — — — — 12th +6/+1 +4 +4 +8 — 6 6 6 6 6 5 3 — — — 13th +6/+1 +4 +4 +8 — 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 — — — 14th +7/+2 +4 +4 +9 — 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 3 — — 15th +7/+2 +5 +5 +9 Sudden Widen 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 — — 16th +8/+3 +5 +5 +10 Advanced learning 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 3 — 17th +8/+3 +5 +5 +10 — 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 — 18th +9/+4 +6 +6 +11 — 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 3 19th +9/+4 +6 +6 +11 — 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 20th +10/+5 +6 +6 +12 Sudden Maximize 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5Illus. by M.

Fifteen years ago, the Duke of Urnst gave the fortress over to the Order of the Fire Hawk, a society of warmages loyal to the realm who desired an isolated stronghold where new initiates could be trained in solitude. With its dun-colored walls rising forbiddingly above the rock-strewn hills and the sweeping view of the Bright Desert to the south, Tarth Moorda is now the principal academy in which war- mages loyal to the Duchy of Urnst are trained, and the emptiness around it rings with the sounds of martial exercises and mighty battle-magic. The uncomfortable climate of the citadel is seen as a distinct advantage by the order; the heat and rugged terrain serve to increase the rigorous nature of the initiates ’ exercises and training. The Fire Hawks adhere to a strictly ordered martial hierarchy and vigorously patrol the hills and sands near their stronghold. Initiates who have not yet learned to cast their first spells serve as footsoldiers and sentries under the command of more senior students. As High Warmaster, the formidable warmage Sereda Ostarte is head of the order, and six warmasters under her directly oversee the training of new initiates. Sereda is quite concerned with the rise of Rary ’s sinister realm in the Bright Desert, and aggressively questions any adventurers found pass-ing through her lands as she seeks word of events deep in the desert (even while hoping to ferret out any spies in the service of the fallen archmage). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs12 CHAPTER 1",

        "description":  "A warmage casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the warmage spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a warmage gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the warmage ’s spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Warmages also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below). See page 90 for the warmage ’s spell list. To cast a spell, a warmage must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell ’s level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st- level spells, and so forth). The Dif ﬁ culty Class for a saving throw against a warmage ’s spell is 10 + the spell ’s level + the warmage ’s Charisma modi ﬁ er. Like other spellcasters, a warmage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1 –1: The Warmage. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score (see Table 1 –1, page 8 of the Player ’s Handbook ). Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a warmage need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. Armored Mage (Ex):  Normally, armor of any type inter- feres with an arcane spellcaster ’s gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage ’s limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class. 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   12 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   12 9/15/04   9:21:06 AM 9/15/04   9:21:06 AMTARTH MOORDATARTH MOORDAPostern Postern GateGate Postern Postern GateGateStudentsStudents’ QuartersQuarters ArmorersArmorers’ ShopShopChapelChapel CisternCistern HouseHouse RoadRoadMain GateMain GateStableStableRefectoryRefectoryKitchenKitchen ArmoryArmoryThe CitadelThe Citadel One Square = 10 feetOne Square = 10 feetNS W EWarmastersWarmasters’ HallHallHighHigh WarmasterWarmaster’s QuartersQuarters TARTH MOORDAPostern Gate Postern GateStudents ’ Quarters Armorers ’ ShopChapel Cistern House RoadMain GateStableRefectory NSKitchen Warmasters ’ HallArmoryThe CitadelHigh Warmaster ’s Quarters One Square = 10 feetW E 13CHAPTER 1 CLASSES At 8th level, a warmage learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure. Warmage Edge (Ex):  A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells. Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. For instance, if a 1st-level w armag e wi th 1 7 In te llig en ce casts magic missile , he deals 1d4+1 points of damage normally, plus an extra 3 points of damage due to his Intelligence bonus. The bonus from the warmage edge special ability applies only to spells that he casts as a warmage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class. 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   13 620_17925_Chpt1.indd   13 9/15/04   9:21:08 AM 9/15/04   9:21:08 AM14 CHAPTER 1 CLASSES A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a ﬁ reball deals the extra damage to all creatures in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level warmage casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the warmage ’s choice) gains the extra damage, even if both missiles are directed at the same target. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round. Scrolls scribed by a warmage do not gain any bene ﬁ t from warmage edge. Scrolls activated by a warmage also gain no bene ﬁ t from warmage edge. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs acti- vated by a warmage use not only the warmage ’s caster level but also gain the bene ﬁ ts of the warmage edge, if applicable. Advanced Learning (Ex):  A t  3 r d ,  6 t h ,  1 1 t h ,  a n d  1 6 t h level, a warmage can add a new spell to his list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a wizard spell of the evocation school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the warmage already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to that warmage ’s spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on the warmage ’s list.",

ENLIGHTENED FIST Not all monks pursue metaphysical perfection to the exclu-sion of all other study. Some monks combine a rigorous discipline of academic study with martial arts and develop-ment of the body. For these monks, that study includes the practice of magic and the implementation of certain arcane tricks into their unarmed combat styles. These enlightened ﬁ sts master the use of touch spells, creating new forms of combat where their ﬁ sts strike with blinding speed, phe- nomenal power, and magical energy. Most enlightened ﬁ sts are monk/sorcerers or monk/wiz- ards. Some focus heavily on one class or the other, while others seek to maintain balance between their arcane and physical training. Enlightened ﬁ sts are most common in metropolitan settings, where magical training is available and becomes an integral component of the monastic life.

The geometer is the master of written magic and spells inscribed within a perfectly rendered diagram. While other s p e l l c a s t e r s  m u s t  r e c o r d  t h e i r  s p e l l s  i n  p a g e s  u p o n  p a g e s  of cryptic formulae, the geometer knows that every spell has a perfect geometrical design, a ﬁ gure whose angles and intersections hint at the secrets hidden in the structure of the multiverse. Geometers are almost always wizards. Many specialize in the school of abjuration, since spells of arcane geometry are often among the most potent magical defenses available. Sorcerers and bards do not prepare spells, and therefore rarely qualify for the class. In any event, they lack the meticulous and studious inclination to perform magic by scribing painstaking diagrams. NPCs who take up the geometer class frequently hold meetings in which numerous members of the profession can expound on their latest projects and inform others of their new theories concerning the nature of  geometry. Adaptation:  While this prestige class describes a geom- eter independent of any location, an interesting idea in any campaign that contains a geometer would be the inclu-sion of a location where a powerful glyph is permanently inscribed in a cliff face or at a mountain ’s base (or apex). This special glyph, perhaps called the Perfect Geometry, would be important to geometers who learn of it, granting them some additional spell knowledge or versatility with their spells (perhaps, once the Perfect Geometry is visited and traced by a geometer, that geometer learns to cast one more glyph-related spell per day). Hit Die: d4. Requirements To qualify to become a geometer, a character must ful ﬁ ll all the following criteria.

Book of Geometry (Ex):  Every spell Filas learns requires only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to write a spell into a spellbook and materials costing 100 gp per page. In addition, the Spellcraft DC for a nongeometer to deci-pher or prepare spells from Filas’s spellbook is increased by 5 (see page 178 of the Player’s Handbook ). Half-Elf Traits:  Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep effects. A half-elf is considered an elf for all effects related to race. Pass Sigil (Su):  Filas can temporarily negate magical wards based on written symbols, sigils, runes, or glyphs. As a standard action, he can make a level check (DC 6 + the sigil creator ’s caster level). If successful, he can suppress the effects of the device for as long as he maintains concentration. Filas must be able to see the device to be passed. Sigilsight (Ex):  Filas can use a Search check to ﬁ nd magic traps based on runes, glyphs, sigils, symbols, and other writ- ings as a rogue can. He gains a +11 bonus on Search checks to ﬁ nd traps of this sort. A geometer who merely comes within 10 feet of a magic rune, glyph, sigil, or symbol, or the threshold of danger for such a device, is entitled to make a Search check as if he were actively searching for a magic trap. Spellglyph (Su):  Filas can cast spells using spellglyphs. Such spells have a special material component (the spellg- lyph) that substitutes for the spell ’s verbal and other material components. When Filas casts a spell using a spellglyph, the spell is treated as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat.

The academy is called the Order in casual conversation, or sometimes just “that college of wizardry. ” It is both a school for ﬂ edgling spellcasters and a guild for those of advanced knowledge and power. The Arcane Order ’s charter is twofold. The group ’s ﬁ rst objective is advancing magical knowledge through both ongoing research and archeological investigation of lost arcane disci p lin es. A g ood po rti o n of r esearch is cen te r ed aro un d elucidating a “magical grammar ” of the great power wielded in ages past, and this research has borne wondrous fruit: metamagic feats. The second tenet is the support and welfare of the Order ’s membership, initially through arcane schooling and later through companionship, resources, boarding, and access to the Spellpool (see the sidebar on page 49). Although nonwizards can bene ﬁ t somewhat from what the Order has to offer, its emphasis on wizardry deters most applicants. In fact, the Order boasts almost no sorcerers, bards, or other characters with signi ﬁ cant talent as spontaneous casters. NPC guildmages often join adventuring companies of nonspellcasters who are not af ﬁ liated with the Order. Thus, they could be encountered anywhere adventure beckons. However, a guild member in good standing returns when he can to the campus, pays his required dues, and does his part in the upkeep of the Spellpool. Adaptation:  This prestige class can be tweaked by chang- ing the premise of the Spellpool. Instead of a construct of s t o r e d  s p e l l s  t h a t  m u s t  a l w a y s  b e  p a i d  b a c k ,  l e s t  d e b t  b e  incurred (see below), perhaps the Order managed to subdue and chain a demigod of ancient days below their stronghold. What the Order members actually do when they call spells from the “Spellpool ” is, perhaps unbeknownst to them, slowly draining the essence of this being.",

        "description":  "At each level indi- cated on Table 2 –14, a master transmogri ﬁ st gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcast-ing class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other bene ﬁ t a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat some- times gained by a wizard). I f  h e  h a d  m o r e  t h a n  o n e  arcane spellcasting class before becoming a master transmogri- ﬁ st, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known. Extended Change (Ex):  A master transmogri ﬁ st gains the bene ﬁ t of the Extend Spell feat on any transmutation spell he casts to change into one of his favored shapes (see below). This bene ﬁ t does not increase the spell ’s level or casting time, or require any special preparation. Spells that can bene ﬁ t from this ability include alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object, and shapechange. Favored Shape (Su):  A master transmogri ﬁ st chooses three favored shapes at 1st level. A favored shape is a speci ﬁ c kind of creature whose form he can assume by means of the polymorph  spell. He cannot choose a creature of his own type (humanoid, most likely) as a favored shape. For example, an 8th-level human sorcerer/1st-level master transmogri ﬁ st might choose pegasus, umber hulk, and bronze dragon as his favored shapes, though because of the Hit Dice restriction, he could become only a very young bronze dragon. A master transmogri ﬁ st gains a number of advantages with his favored shapes, as noted in the following class feature descriptions. At every odd-numbered level beyond 1st, a master trans- mogri ﬁ st gains one additional favored shape. Thus, he has four at 3rd level, ﬁ ve at 5th level, six at 7th level, and seven at 9th level. Furthermore, once per master transmogri ﬁ st level beyond 1st, a character can choose to lose a previously chosen favored shape and select a replacement. Manifest Senses (Su):  At 2nd level and higher, a master transmogri ﬁ st gains the senses of his favored shape when he assumes its form. Senses include extraor- dinary special qualities such as blindsense, blindsight, dark- vision, low-light vision, scent, and tremorsense. Battle Mastery (Ex):  At 3rd level, a master transmogri ﬁ st gains a +2 competence bonus on all attack rolls he makes while in one of his favored shapes. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at 9th level. Effortless Change (Ex):  At 4th level, a master transmogri ﬁ st learns how to change his form through a simple act of will. He can choose to apply the bene ﬁ ts of the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats (even if he doesn ’t have the feats) to any transmutation spell he casts to change into one of his favored shapes. This bene ﬁ t does not increase the spell ’s level or casting time, or require any special preparation. Spells that can bene ﬁ t from this ability include alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object,  and shapechange. Shapechanger (Ex):  A master transmogri ﬁ st acquires the shapechanger subtype at 5th level. He also gains the ability to remain in an assumed form inde ﬁ ni t e l y w h e n h e casts alter self.  This works exactly like the alter self  spell except that the duration is permanent. In other words, a master transmogri ﬁ st can remain in the form he assumes as long as he wishes, until either he chooses to dismiss it or the alter self effect is dispelled. Reﬂ exive Change (Ex):  At 7th level and higher, a master transmogri ﬁ st has the ability to change into a favored shape Mekkhier Saadren, a master transmogriﬁ  stIllus. by T.

If he has an appropriate spell prepared an d  ch oo s e s  t o  us e  this  a b ili ty ,  h e  can  ch an g e  f o rm  as  an  immediate action (see page 86) in response to the action of another creature. For example, a master transmogri ﬁ st might turn into a dragon turtle to gain a high Armor Class against an impending attack, or change into a red dragon to gain imm unity to the ﬁ re damage of an enemy ’s ﬁ re storm spell. The spell is expended as if the transmogri ﬁ st had cast it normally, and he remains in his new form until either the spell ’s duration expires or he dismisses it. A transmogri ﬁ st gives up his next action to make a re ﬂ exive change. If a master transmogri ﬁ st is currently under the effect of a shapechange  spell he cast on himself, he can use his reﬂ exive change ability as often as he likes (although never more than once per round). Each time he uses it, he loses his next action. Manifest Qualities (Ex):  At 8th level and higher, a master transmogri ﬁ st has all the extraordinary special qualities of any favored shape he assumes. For example, he could change into a troll to make use of the troll ’s regeneration ability, or take the form of a green hag to gain spell resistance 18. Inﬁ nite Variety (Su):  At 10th level, a master transmog- riﬁ st gains the ability to create completely imaginary forms when he casts polymorph, polymorph any object,  or shapechange on himself. To create an imaginary form, he chooses one of his favored shapes as a base form. He can then choose a single aspect of a second monster whose form he could assume using the spell he is casting and add it to the ﬁ rst creature. His available options include the following.• Replace the base form ’s natural armor bonus with that of the second form. • Add the second form ’s movement modes. • Add one of the second form ’s natural attack types (with the appropriate reach), if the base form doesn ’t have that attack type already. • Add an extraordinary special attack of the second form. • Add an extraordinary special quality of the second form. • Replace one of the base form ’s physical ability scores, if both the base form and the second form are the same size category. For example, if a young red dragon is the base form and a giant octopus is the second, a master transmogri ﬁ st could add the octopus ’s eight tentacle rakes (damage 1d4 + Str bonus) to the dragon ’s available natural attacks.

From an early age, those destined to walk this path l earn li ttl e tri cks o f m ani p ula ti o n t o g e t th e ir w a y . La t e r , they turn to spellcasting to enhance their already impressive skills at bluf ﬁ ng, intimidating, and otherwise dealing with people to their own advantage. Magic holds the promise of complete mental domination, and the mindbender realizes it spectacularly. Spellcasters who take this prestige class give up a great deal of their caster level advancement, but they instead gain ever-greater abilities to alter and eventually command the will of others. Anyone who is ready to sacri ﬁ ce magic for manipulation is a suitable candidate for this prestige class. Mindbenders do not get on well with one another, as each attempts to assert his control over the rest. It is not unknown for one mindbender to secretly control another —such is considered the perfect front. Possessing the power to control others ’ minds doesn ’t ensure immunity to the same treatment. Most NPC mindbenders are neutral or evil in alignment. Using magic to enslave the will of others is rarely a good act, especially if the mindbender has no intention of ever compensating his thrall for its involuntary service or releasing it in the future. NPC mindbenders therefore tend to be found in positions where their enchantment abilities allow them to amass great wealth and in ﬂ uence, ruling small towns or isolated keeps as the power behind the throne, secret masters who brook no rival in their domains.",

This primal music —of unknown origin and with no limit to its power —i s  i n c o m p r e h e n s i b l e  t o  t h e  m o r t a l  e a r .  T o some who hear a fragment of this music, it becomes beauty incarnate, and they devote their lives to its discovery. These seekers wield the power of music in ways that amaze even the most skilled bards. U n i t e d  o n l y  b y  t h e i r  q u e s t ,  s e e k e r s  o f  t h e  s o n g  h a v e incredibly diverse goals and motivations. Some black-hearted seekers know that this primal music is power, and they lust after it in hopes of turning it against their many enemies. Others search for the music to bring joy and peace. Most have more moderate aspirations and seek the music because it moves them. Regardless of their goals, seekers of the song rarely work against one another —each hoping that another seeker will uncover another piece of the primal music and share it with the rest. The song never leaves a seeker, and its power can have strange effects on their souls. Some retire from society, seeking the silence of distant monasteries or mountaintops from which to better concentrate on the music they once heard. Others remain unchanged to outward appearances, yet the music remains in the back of their minds at all times. Some talk to any who will listen about the importance and beauty of the primal music, while others cannot seem to ﬁ nd the words to express what this music means to them or to the world. Every seeker of the song must have at least one bard level, but beyond that, their stories and careers differ wildly. Many begin their adventuring careers as bards, drawn to music from their earliest days. Others come to the class after adventuring as fighters, rogues, clerics, or members of other classes for most of their careers, with little idea that the primal music will become their chosen path. Although at least a few seekers emerge from every class, few wizards or sorcerers take up the pursuit; members of these classes are more likely to devote themselves to traditional spellcasting rather than the strange pull of the primal music. Adaptation:  The seeker of the song prestige class presents a powerful new set of bardic abilities, going far beyond the basic bardic music ability presented in the Player ’s Handbook . Many campaigns can benefit from exploring this facet of the game, but a DM might not want 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   56 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   56 9/15/04   3:00:05 PM 9/15/04   3:00:05 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 57to introduce the idea of primal music into a campaign ’s cosmology. In this case, the seekers of the song might become the disciples of a distant bardic college. The col-lege is extreme in the eyes of other bards: They discard the notion of bards as wanderers and gatherers of diverse skills, and instead focus on music as a force of magic to the exclusion of all else. Hit Die:  d6. Requirements To qualify to become a seeker of the song, a character must fulﬁ ll all the following criteria.",

WILD MAGE Magic is one of the most capricious and unpredictable of all natural or supernatural forces in the universe. Attempts to codify spellcasting through arcane formulas, or to impose order on magic through the force of will, are essentially pointless —or so wild mages believe. Instead, those who would truly master magic must forget what they know and abandon their willful control of the arcane. Within this paradox lies the awesome power of wild magic. The wild mage aspires to cast spells without structure. By taking the risk of substituting an element of randomness, she gives up the safe predictability of other arcane spellcasters. This risk allows for the potential of power greater than other casters can hope for. Of course, she also risks the potential for less power, but what is magic if not risky? Chaos is strong, and her magic often carries her to heights of power that other casters cannot reach —but chaos is also ﬁ ckle, and her spells sometimes fall short of her expectations. In addition, from time to time her spells unfold in spectacular wild surges that might prove catastrophic to the wild mage and her companions. The wild mage accepts this as the price of her convictions. Sorcerers are naturally intrigued by the study of wild magic. The act of unchaining their spells from the safe- guards and controls built into these time-honored formulas appeals to many of them. One might suppose that few wizards would be drawn to the spontaneity and unpredict-ability of wild magic, but in fact many wizards do become wild mages, seeking to explore and harness the power of chaos. Wild mages tend to be solitary innovators. They have little contact with their fellow spellcasters, since wild mages can’t really learn from them. Rumors persist of a secretive Prismatic Cabal of wild mages who cloister themselves within the depths of Limbo to experience the power of chaos ﬁ rsthand. Capricious and powerful, NPC wild mages act much like chaotic sorcerers and wizards. Some are heroes who join parties crusading against tyranny and evil, while others are villains who revel in the chaos of destruction and disaster. A few wild mages (generally not good-aligned ones) believe that the power of their magic increases as the amount of chaos and uncertainty in the world around them rises, and therefore they bend their efforts toward instigating catastrophes of all kinds.",

Bene ﬁ t: Any necromancy spell you cast can be cast instead as a Moilian spell, dealing an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1d6 per two spell levels (+1d6 for 1st-level spells, +2d6 for 2nd- or 3rd-level spells, and so on). If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spell ’s normal effect. In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian rune- bone —a small human bone (often a ﬁ nger bone) scribed with carefully prepared ar- cane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and re- quires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative e n e r g y  d a m a g e  t o  b e  g e n e r a t -ed. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft. While the maxi- mum negative energy damage dealt by a Moil- ian spell is based on the spell ’s level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts ﬁ nger of death (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative ener-gy damage. A Moilian spell uses a spell slot of the spell ’s nor- mal level.

DRACONIC POWER [DRACONIC] You have greater power manipulating the energies of your heritage. Prerequisite:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: Your caster level increases by 1, and you add 1 to the save DC of all arcane spells with the energy descriptor of the same energy type as determined by your draconic heritage. Special:  If the Energy Substitution feat is used to modify a spell, this feat will work if the new type of energy matches the energy type of your draconic heritage. DRACONIC PRESENCE [DRACONIC] When you use your magic, your mere presence can terrify those around you. Prerequisite:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: Whenever you cast an arcane spell, all opponents within 10 feet of you who have fewer Hit Dice than you become shaken for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell you cast. The effect is negated by a Will save (DC 10 + level of the spell cast + your Cha modi ﬁ er). A successful save indicates that the opponent is immune t o  y o u r  d r a c o n i c  p r e s e n c e  f o r  2 4  h o u r s .

DRACONIC RESISTANCE [DRACONIC] Your bloodline hardens your body against the energy type of your progenitor. Prerequisite:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: Y ou gain resistance to the energy type of your draconic heritage equal to three times the number of draconic feats you currently have (including draconic feats you take after gaining this feat). DRACONIC SKIN [DRACONIC] Your skin takes on the sheen, luster, and hardness of your draconic parentage.  Prerequisites:  Draconic Heritage. Bene ﬁ t: Your natural armor increases by 1. ENERGY ADMIXTURE [METAMAGIC] You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to add an equal amount of another energy type. Prerequisite:  Energy Substitution. Bene ﬁ t: Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or ﬁ re) that matches an energy type you have selected for substitu- tion via the Energy Substitution feat. You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor by adding an equal amount of th e ch ose n type o f e n e r gy t o th e spe ll ’s normal effects. The altered spell works normally in all respects except for the type and amount of damage dealt, with each type of energy counting separately toward the spell ’s damage cap. Thus, an acid ﬁ reball cast at 6th level deals 6d6 points of ﬁ re damage and 6d6 points of acid damage (rolled separately), while the same acid ﬁ reball cast at 10th level or higher deals 10d6 points of ﬁ re damage and 10d6 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy (such as ﬁ re and cold) can be combined using this feat. An energy admixed spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell ’s actual level. As well, the spell ’s descriptor changes to include both energy types present in the spell —for example, the acid ﬁ reball  described above is an evocation [acid, ﬁ re] spell.",

PIERCE MAGICAL PROTECTION You can overcome the magical protections of your enemies. Prerequisites: Con 13, Mage Slayer. Bene ﬁ t: Your contempt for magic is so ﬁ erce that as a standard action you can make a melee attack that ignores any bonuses to Armor Class granted by spells (including spell trigger or spell completion effects created by magic items such as wands or potions). If you deal damage to your opponent, you also instantly and automatically dispel all that opponent ’s spells and spell effects that grant a bonus to Armor Class. Special:  Taking this feat reduces your caster level for all your spells and spell-like abilities by 4. PRACTICED SPELLCASTER Choose a spellcasting class that you possess. Your spells cast from that class are more powerful. Prerequisite: Spellcraft 4 ranks. Bene ﬁ t: Your caster level for the chosen spellcasting class increases by 4.

If the marshal already has the feat, he can choose a different one. Grant Move Action (Ex):Starting at 4th level, a marshal can direct and motivate his allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a standard action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies’ initiative count; the round continues normally after the marshal’s turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose ini- tiative count immediately follows the marshal’s may get an extra move action from the marshal, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally’s turn.) At 8th level, a marshal gains the ability to grant an extra move action to his allies twice per day. The frequency increases to three Illus. by S.
