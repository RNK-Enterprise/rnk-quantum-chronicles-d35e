Lukacs 6 RETPAHC WEN SRETSNOM MUMMIFIED CREATURE Hulking corpse Mummies are undead creatures, em- balmed using ancient necromantic lore. Often set as guardians for sa- cred sites, mummies defend their charges until destroyed. Should a mummy be unable to defend its charge for any reason, it becomes an unreasoning spirit of vengeance, hunting those who desecrated the site it was tasked to defend. A mummy appears withered and desiccated, its features hidden beneath centuries-old funereal wrappings. It moves with a slow, shambling gait and groans with the weight of the ages. Symbols of the deity it once served often mark these horrid creatures. While other undead stink of carrion, the herbs and powders used to create a mummy give off a sharp, pungent odor, like that of a spice cabinet. SAMPLE MUMMIFIED CREATURE This example uses an ogre as the base Tramping out of the night is a creature. dreadful giant corpse. For all that its eyes are lifeless and devoid of mind, the creature’s gaze still promises swift death to any that Mummifi ed Ogre it can catch and crush in its mighty grip.
