        "description":  "1 hour/level (D) This spell functions similarly to contingency , but with a more limited scope. While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types ofenergy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell auto-matically grants you resistance 10 against that type ofenergy for the remainder of the spell’s duration (just as ifyou were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appro- priate type). Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can’t be changed. Youcan’t have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect on yourself at the same time—if you cast the spell a secondtime while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spellautomatically expires. The energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type(such as from the resist energy spell). However, it is pos- sible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy (fire) and contingent energy resistance (electricity), or anyother two such spells that protect against different types of energy .",

Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dun- geon). You must be able to communicate with the dragon to bargain for its services. The summoned dragon requires payment for its services, which takes the form of coins, gems, or other pre- cious objects the dragon can addto its hoard. This payment mustbe made before the dragon agreesto perform any services. The bar-gaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. Tasks requiring up to 1 minute per caster level require a payment of 100 gp per HD of the summoneddragon. For a task requiring up to 1 hour per caster level, thecreature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. Long-termtasks (those requiring up to 1 day per caster level) require apayment of 1,000 gp per HD. Especially hazardous tasks require a greater gift, up to twice the given amount. A dragon never accepts less thanthe indicated amount, even for a nonhazardous task. At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for elapses, the creature returns to the place it was sum-moned from (after reporting back to you, if appropriateand possible).",

The process usu- ally involves a cooperative effort between an evil dragon and a powerful cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but especially powerful spellcasters have been known to coerce an evil dragon to undergo the transformation against its will. The dragon must first consume a lethal concoction known as a dracolich brew (see page 120). This act instantly slays the dragon, whereupon its spirit is transferred to its dracolich phylactery (also see page 120), regardless of the distance between the phylactery and the dragon’s body . A spirit contained in a phylactery can sense any reptilian or dragon corpse of Medium or larger size within 90 feet and attempt to pos- sess it. Under no circumstances can the spirit possess aliving body . The spirit’s original body is an ideal vessel, andany attempt to possess it is automatically successful. To pos-sess a suitable corpse other than its own, a dracolich mustmake a successful Charisma check (DC 10 for a true dragon,CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSIllus. by S.

In fact, it is possible to walk right pastone (despite its size) and never suspect it was there. How-ever, once it is awakened, its tread shakes the ground. Mountain landwyrms subsist primarily on a diet of stone, occasionally venturing forth for a meal of a few direbears or stone giants.

PLANAR DRAGONS In addition to the many dragon species native to the Mater-ial Plane, a number of dragons hail from other planes, par-ticularly the Outer Planes. Collectively referred to as planardragons, these creatures hail from planes asdiverse as Limbo, Acheron, Ysgard, andeven the Ethereal Plane. Unlike most other true dragons, planar dragons are not innate spellcasters;though they have a variety of spell-likepowers, they don’t have the natural affin-ity for sorcery that their Material Planerelatives have. A planar dragon uses itsage category as its caster level for allspell-like abilities.

Blood Drain (Ex): A vampiric dragon can suck blood from a living victim one size category smaller than itself or larger. If it pins the foe with whom it is grappling, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. Charm (Su): The voice of a vam- piric dragon can bewitch listeners. This requires a full-round action by the vampiric dragon, but any creatures within 30 feet per age category of the base dragon who can hear its voice must make a Will save or become charmed (as charm monster ).

If a vampiric dragon instead drains its victim’s Constitution to 0, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer Hit Diceand as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD.

This ability workssimilarly to a gaze attack, except that the vampiric dragonmust use a standard action, and those merely looking at thecreature are not affected.

Forced out of her lair by amarauding band of gnolls, she now finds herself huntedthroughout her territory . Strangely, the gnolls seem pro- tected against her frightful presence, uncowed by hercombat prowess, and not satisfied by just taking over her lairand stealing her hoard. The reason behind this uncharacter-istic behavior is a gnoll cleric who has taken Poccri’sdestruction as a personal quest in honor of Erythnul. Poccri never stays in the same place for long, rarely curl- ing up in the same crevice for more than one night. Sheexpends all her energy fighting the gnolls where she canand seeking allies in the desolate land of her territory .",

While other bronzes maybe content to let evil dragons make their lairs nearby andhatch who knows what evil plans, Eyruaad believes intaking the fight right to evil’s front door. He does not tol-erate any evil creature’s presence anywhere near his (rathersmall) territory, especially evil dragons. He uses a widenetwork of animals and humanoids to keep him informedof attacks by evil creatures, and personally investigateseach such report in order to protect the innocents in hiscare. His major failing is an eagerness to do battle, withlittle regard for his actual chance of success. So far, his luckhas not failed him, but it might not be long before Eyruaadneeds protection himself.",

However, when she can’tavert a fight through intimidation, frightful presence, orrepulsion gas, she tends to fly away, usually with a comment such as, “You’re not a worthy challenge!” She saves her bel-ligerence for evil creatures, of course, and is quite kindamong friends and like-minded allies—as long as no onecalls her bravery into question.",

For more D UNGEONS \u0026 D RAGONS articles, adventures, and information, visit www .wizards.com/dndDraconomicon is the ultimate D\u0026D®game accessory about the legendary creatures that give the game itsname. Packed into the pages of this book are newdragon prestige classes, spells, feats, dragonlike mon-sters, and full statistics for 120 sample dragons—all tenof the chromatic and metallic dragons at all 12 age cate-gories. A few pages of new material on half-dragonsround out the book’s offerings, but there just wasn’troom to include samples of those. This article presents ten sample half-dragons, one spawned from each of the ten true dragons presentedin the Monster Manual . Each description includes a brief personality profile and some background notes,plus a full statistics block for the creature and sampletreasure appropriate for the encounter. TIBULLIAX, HALF-COPPER DRAGON/ HALF-ANDROSPHINX Copper dragons and androsphinxes share the same ter- rain options and alignment. Thus, it comes as no sur-prise that an androsphinx tired of dealing with trouble-some gynosphinxes might turn to an adult copperdragon for companionship instead, resulting in off-spring such as Tibulliax. Tibulliax lives in warm, hilly terrain, enjoying a life of comfort. Perhaps ironically, he seeks a gynosphinx asa mate because he appreciates riddles more than hisfather ever did.",
