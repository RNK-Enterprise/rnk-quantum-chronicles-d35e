Should Dolcianne ever recover from her lost state, she would be a powerful ally for her rescuers. COMBAT Because of her own misery, Dolcianne is driven to cause pain and sadness to any living creatures she sees. She is especially cruel to human, elf, or half-elf females, since they remind her all too much of her lost friend. Blinding Beauty (Su): Any creature within 30 feet of Dolcianne that looks directly at her must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded, as though by the blindness spell. Dolcianne can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. Rage (Ex): Once per day, Dolcianne can enter a state of fierce rage that lasts for 8 rounds. The following changes are in effect as long as she rages: hp increase by 45; AC 22, touch 16, flat-footed 22; Grp +10; Atk +13 melee (1d10+5, spiked chain) or +10 ranged (1d4+4, slam); Full Atk +13/+8 melee (1d10+5, spiked chain) or +10 ranged (1d4+4, slam); SV Fort +14, Will +15; Str 18, Con 20; Swim +12. At the end of her rage, Dolcianne is fatigued for the duration of the encounter. Song of Misery (Ex): As a free action, Dolcianne can begin a droning song. Every creature within 30 feet who can hear her is fascinated for as long as the song continues, plus 1 round thereafter (Will negates, DC 18). The sight of her does not allow a new saving throw, but any attack made against an affected character—even if the attack comes from Dolcianne herself—automatically ends the effect.
