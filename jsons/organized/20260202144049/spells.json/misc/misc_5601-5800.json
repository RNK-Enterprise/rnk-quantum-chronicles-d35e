You then can reroll your initiative roll. If the result of the second roll is equal to or less than your opponent’s, you lose initiative and can’t challenge it again in this round. If the second roll is higher than your opponent’s roll, you win, but your opponent now has the option to challenge initiative. (If your opponent wins, you can challenge it again, and so on.) Whoever finally wins initiative determines who takes the first phase. Multiplayer Initiative With more than two players, the sequence for chal- lenging initiative goes like this:. 1. All players roll for initiative. If any two players tie, all players reroll. 2. Each player, starting with the lowest roller and going up, decides whether to challenge initiative, at a cost of 1 command point.

But when an opponent’s cleric casts legion’s curse of petty failingon the unit, you can have your commander ignore that effect. COMMANDER POSITION An attached commander leads its unit either from the front or from the rear, whether the unit is formed or unformed. The position of the commander’s miniature indicates this but doesn’t represent the commander’s actual location. It merely indicates whether the commander is at the forefront of the action or hanging back. Whether it is leading from the front or rear, the distance to and from an attached commander is the same as the dis- tance to and from the unit itself. The position of the actual miniature representing the commander is not relevant. For example, a commander leading from the rear can spend com- mand points on other units within 6 inches of the unit to which it is attached.

        "description":  "33–64 HD (Medium-size) The famine spirit, also called a ravenous ghoul, is a corpo- real undead motivated entirely by hunger. It seeks to con- sume in death all that it was denied in life. It eats every- thing and anything that a living being could, but its hunger is never sated. A famine spirit can consume the comestibles of a Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion (caster level 14th) in a mere 5 hours and still be hungry for more. In a day, it can consume as many as one hun- dred humans. A famine spirit appears as an obscenely obese human- oid or monstrous humanoid with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. Should the need present itself, a famine spirit can unhinge its jaw to swallow objects too large for it to consume normally. Undead are among the few creatures that a famine spirit does not eat, so it may attract groups of ghouls and ghasts that serve it and feast in its wake. COMBAT Famine spirits ignore most other living things, turning on them only if they get in the way of its feasting, or if there is nothing else to consume.

Once they decide to become visible, they immediately attack so as to use their frightful presence ability. Great fihyrs are unaffected by sunlight, but they despise it. Thus, they prefer to lay low during the day in dark, secluded spots, such as caves, dungeons, abandoned build- ings, and the like. Frightful Presence (Ex): Any creature that witnesses a great fihyr attacking becomes panicked if it fails a Will save (DC 20). Emotion Control(Sp):At will, the great fihyr can produce an effect like that of an emotionspell (despair, fear,or hate only; caster level 16th; Will save DC 16), except that its range is 260 feet, its radius is 15 feet, and it lasts as long as the creature concentrates on it. The great fihyr can use this ability and remain invisible. Invisibility (Ex): A great fihyr can become invisible at will.

The undead gain the ability to cast spells, can resist being turned, and become more difficult to attack in melee. The process benefits undead with intelligence far more than it helps those that are mindless, since intelligent undead can dis- charge their spells tactically. The outward sign that an undead creature has been spell- stitched is its rune-covered body. The runes are carved into the bones of skeletal undead or tattooed on the rotting flesh of other corporeal undead. These runes may not be immedi- ately noticeable to an observer, appearing to be cracks in bones or wrinkles in the skin. Spellstitched creatures can be created only by a wizard or sorcerer of sufficient level to cast the spells to be imbued in the undead’s body. The process for creating a spellstitched creature requires the expenditure of 1,000 gp for carving or tattooing materials as well as 500 XP for every point of Wisdom that the undead creature possesses. Undead that are spellcasters can spellstitch themselves.
