Rebellious young goliaths often learn the traits of self-suffi ciency and independence—useful in a future career as an adventurer—when they spend a lot of time being shunned for minor infractions. Has your goliath character been shunned by his tribe? If so, for what infraction? How does he feel about this? Even when away from his tribe, does he use shunning to convey his disapproval of others’ actions? How does he explain this behavior to his companions? Exiles Being exiled from the tribe is both the worst punish- ment an adjudicator can mete out, and the ultimate fate of all goliaths who don’t die in battle or mishap. Exiles get a new honorifi c from the chieftain refl ecting their changed status; then they pack their personal items into a backpack, say good- bye to friends and family, and walk away from the tribe, never to return. If a goliath is exiled due to age or debilitating injury, the lamenter performs a lament as the exile leaves. How- ever, if exile is a punishment handed down by an adjudicator, no lament is performed, and the exiled goliath is shunned until he walks away.

This calculation provides a reasonable estimate for a rune circle with a 10-foot radius, which is the typical size for a rune circle. If the rune circle is smaller or larger than 10 feet in radius, the DM may choose to reduce or increase the cost according to Table 7–7: Variant Rune Circle Sizes. In some cases, the estimated gold piece value might not fully represent the appropriate value for a rune circle. For instance, a rune circle that grants a bonus on Craft checks is worth more than the estimate would suggest, since the circle’s lack of portability isn’t a signifi cant factor in its util- ity.
