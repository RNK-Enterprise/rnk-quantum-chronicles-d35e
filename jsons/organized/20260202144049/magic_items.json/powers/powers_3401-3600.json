These ghosts sometimes spend days or even weeks here, chatting with each other and the Deathwarden dwarves (or other Ghostwalk- ers) that pass through. They are obviously nervous about going to the land of the dead—they know that after they enter, they cannot come back. Once through the Moribund Hall, characters come to the Veil of Souls itself. Within a great stone arch, it seems as though the well-crafted dwarven walls simply give way to a natural rock passage filled with mist.

The rest of the fortress is a sweeping structure of tall, finely crafted chambers lit by ever-burning mag- ical torches. Although they appear to have actual flames on their ends, these torches consume no oxygen and cannot be used to start fires (except on the ends of other magical torches). There are large banquet halls and meeting rooms throughout the structure, but there never seem to be festivals or meetings.

Con- sequently, running a campaign using this material can be challenging. Yet at the same time, for the same reasons, running a Ghostwalk campaign can be extremely rewarding for both you and your players. “When you die, you don’t have to stop playing”— that’s the core idea behind Ghostwalk. When characters die during an adventure in or near (or under) Manifest, the PCs immediately become ghosts that the players can keep playing. This is a new facet to playing the game that creates all sorts of interesting situations. Dungeon Masters should always keep the core idea in mind when running a Ghostwalkcampaign. Don’t let this unique aspect of the setting become commonplace and unspectacular to your players. STARTING A GHOSTWALKCAMPAIGN The first thing that you need to decide as a DM with this product in hand is how you’re going to use it. Is Manifest a city that the PCs will visit (possibly in an extended stay), or is it their home and the focus of the campaign? Will you add it to an existing setting, or will you use only what’s provided here? And once the action begins, what sort of campaign are you going to run? THEMATIC CAMPAIGNS IN MANIFEST There are as many types of D\u0026D campaigns as there are gaming groups. Some people like to make campaigns out of completely episodic adventures (one story having little or nothing to do with the previous or next). Others prefer campaigns that focus on a specific theme, and the PCs’ actions in one mission have reper- cussions that will affect all future adventures (and shape the development of the entire campaign setting). The unique nature of the city of Manifest makes it well suited to both styles of play—there’s something for everyone in the city on death’s doorstep. Dungeon Crawls Things get only more complicated when you start The basic unit of currency in the D\u0026D game is the to factor in the Yisa-khardomas.

They are not linked in any way, and you (the DM) can use them in whatever order you want; they are presented in order of recommended character levels from lowest to highest. Some of them are full-fledged adventures that take the characters to several locations in and around the city of Manifest, while others are simply site-based encounters that can be placed wherever you wish within the Undercity (or elsewhere, with some modifications). Of course, as with all adventures, you need a copy of the three D\u0026D core rulebooks—the Player’s Handbook, the DUNGEONMASTER’s Guide,and the Monster Manual— in order to use these adventures effectively. You should also read through each adventure ahead of time to familiarize yourself with the particulars. Text that appears in shaded boxes is player informa- tion, which you may read aloud or paraphrase, as appropriate. Text in sidebars contains important DM notes for you, offering insight into issues peculiar to the situation. Monster and nonplayer character (NPC) statistics are provided with each encounter in abbrevi- ated form. Full monster statistics for standard monsters are in either the Monster Manualor in Chapter 5 of this book. You should review all of these statistics before the game starts to refresh your memory of the crea- tures’ abilities. Each encounter is given an Encounter Level (EL) to let you know how challenging it should be for the adventurers. TOUCH AND GO An introductory Ghostwalk adventure for 1st-level characters. SYNOPSIS While in the Tombyards (see the map of Manifest in Chapter 2), the PCs are accosted by a ghoul. A strange note in the ghoul’s possession leads them to a clandes- tine meeting with some members of the Golden, Manifest’s thieves’ guild. The thieves have stolen a device they believe to be a powerful magic item from a wizard, but what they don’t realize is that the item you think that will interest them).

Undead are essentially animated by negative energy, though this anima- tion is sometimes dependent upon the undead’s ability to feed. Still, while biology plays little part in the existence of these creatures, the undead do have some similarities to living beings. Like ectothermic (cold-blooded) creatures, the unliving lack the ability to produce their own heat and must depend on their environment for warmth. This inability to produce heat is a defi ning undead characteristic, most remarked upon by scholars and those who encounter them, and often compared to the chill of the grave. To classify undead as cold- blooded creatures would be inaccurate, however, since undead are mostly bloodless. Like ectotherms, undead take on the temperature of their surround- ings. However, unlike cold-blooded living creatures, undead are not unduly harmed by particularly low temperatures (unless they become frozen solid) or particularly high temperatures (unless they begin to smolder and burn). Diet Some undead exist for centuries without interact- ing with any living beings, while others seem to require, or at least crave with an unstoppable pas- sion, the fl esh, energy, or life force of the still living. However, even undead that do not need to eat may have a preferred morsel. Essentially, some undead can choose to eat if they desire, even if they have no requirement to consume. They could eat even ordinary food, if they desired to appear normal or were interested in trying to tease out some hint of fl avor; undead with tongues, such as ghouls and skirrs (see page 120) actually retain their sense of taste. Some undead glory in their ability to feed off the living. Others, especially the more intelligent, romanticize or even eroticize their need to feed on the living to maintain their strength (or to feed their addiction). Still, despite the fact that this feeding ability is often dangerous (or even deadly) to those who oppose them, the hunger behind it is a major weakness for many undead. With all of this in mind, undead feeding require- ments can be broken into three types: not required, inescapable craving, and diet dependent.",
