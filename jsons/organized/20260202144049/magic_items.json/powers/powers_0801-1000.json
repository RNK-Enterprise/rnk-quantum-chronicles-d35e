        "description":  "The typical Daggerspell Guard - ian is a low-level druid or wizard who has made the unorthodox choice of learning to ﬁght with two weap - ons—speciﬁcally, two daggers. After she has ﬁnished her apprenticeship, a member often joins a group of adventurers. The guild encourages members to ﬁght against evil actively, discover lost treasures or wells of power, and work diligently to oppose monstrous creatures that threaten civilized areas. When not adventuring, a typical member lives off the proceeds of past adven - tures, although a few ﬁnd work in law enforcement or as special investigators in communities where crime is a problem. Because they are so focused on spellcasting, Guardians often spend time with other guild members, learning more advanced spells or practicing their ﬁghting techniques. Prestige Classes: Most members of the Daggerspell Guardians aspire to become either daggerspell shapers or daggerspell mages, depending on whether they have an afﬁnity for divine or arcane magic. Members of the daggerspell prestige classes are afforded special respect in the guild, and even those with little spellcasting ability see themselves on the path to entering one of the prestige classes. The highest-ranking members have levels in one of the two daggerspell classes, but powerful and inﬂuential members of other classes have forged lasting alliances with the Guardians without taking levels in either prestige class or formally becoming members of the organization.  Lore of the Guild: Many of the greatest treasures of the Daggerspell Guardians are, not surprisingly, pairs of matched magic daggers of great power. Two of the most treasured of these daggersw, the emerald knives of seven truths , were lost years ago by a daggerspell shaper who fell in battle against a powerful vampire named Malkan Ry-Ul. Both the knives and the vampire have been missing for many years, but recently travelers from the east have reported that a great city there is haunted by a killer who leaves strange green cuts on the bodies of his victims—a signature side effect of the magic of the emerald knives.",

Since those with a predilection for both stealth and psionics are rare, the Shadowmind Guild is careful to monitor any such individuals within the city. Once a candidate’s varied abilities have developed to the point where she qualiﬁes for the shadowmind prestige class, the guild decides whether or not to extend an invita - tion. These decisions are complex and depend greatly on the personalities of current guild members, and the DM has a great deal of discretion when resolving such invitations. Character Beneﬁts: Characters who belong to the Shadowmind Guild gain a +4 bonus on Gather Informa - tion checks when in the guild’s home city, and they have ready access to two or three nondescript and well-hidden safe houses within the city.

One who joins an adventuring party often serves as the group’s primary negotiator, using his skills to smooth the group’s way with local authorities, ferreting out countless adven - ture leads through his association with the league, and providing a wealth of information through his diverse knowledge. Despite this common archetype, a few members go against the grain. These unusually introverted individuals approach storytelling as an art form, breaking out of their normally shy behavior only when properly prepared to tell a story.

This adventure site details thathaven of peaceful study. Secrets of the Fochlucan College is an adventure site that can be dropped into any area that has a large, clear lake.A variety of adventures can take place here, sinceoutsiders frequently infiltrate the college to search forits secrets. As always, feel free to adapt the materialpresented here as you see fit to make it work with yourcampaign. PREPARATION You (the DM) need the D\u0026D core rulebooks—thePlayer’s Handbook, the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and the Monster Manual —as well as Complete Adventurer— to use this adventure site. The information presented hereutilizes the D\u0026D v.3.5 rules. To get started, print out the adventure site, including the map. Read through it at least once to familiarizeyourself with the situation, site, and major NPCs(particularly their motivations). You must decide whatkind of action takes place—whether the PCs simplystumble upon the site or have a reason to visit. Monsterand NPC statistics are provided with each encounterarea in abbreviated form. BACKGROUND Visitors to the famous (or as some would say, infamous)Fochlucan College often come away disappointed.Given the reputation the Fochlucan masters havegained for international intrigue, most travelers expectto find a bustling citadel of learning that is also a bastionof military strength—with furnishings and a treasuryto match. Instead, they find a sleepy country retreatwhere a handful of distracted scholars study the minu-tia of the past, without so much as an armed guard insight. Thanks to a hardworking staff of servants, thewhole building is spotless, but the age of its furnishingsis obvious. Detractors might call the place threadbare orshabby, but it has a comfortable, lived-in look. In fact,the college looks much like a rural manor belonging toan impoverished noble family whose members havelong been accustomed to empty coffers. The college’s worn appearance reflects the building’s true role as a meeting place for energetic people whooccasionally need a place to rest or confer with colleagues. 2The Fochlucan masters obviously place a higher value on deeds and ideas than on brick and mortar. Over the years, the countless burglars and spies who have infiltrated the college have all but gone madsearching for secret documents, vast treasures, or both.These invaders inevitably fail, because the biggestsecret of the Fochlucan College is that it holds nosecrets at all. Still, it remains a place of mystery in thepopular imagination—a misconception that theFochlucan masters take no pains to correct. THE FOCHLUCAN COLLEGE As noted on page 49 of Complete Adventurer, the college is located on the shore of Loch Firrnen, a few milesfrom the town of Oakenway. Thick woods surround thelake and the building, separating them from the town.Visitors can hike through the woods to the lake andthen travel by water to the college, but an overland tripgenerally proves easier and is certainly more direct. No signposts point the way to the college, but a well- used road connecting Oakenway to nearby communi-ties passes fairly near the place, and a meandering pathconnects a loop in that road with the college. Mostcasual travelers overlook the connecting path because itlooks like a simple woodcutter’s lane or game trail. TheFochlucan masters make no special effort to conceal thecollege’s location, however, and most residents ofOakenway know the route. FEATURES The college is a two-story stone structure with a slateroof. A thick layer of climbing ivy covers its ancientwalls. Unless otherwise stated in the description of a specific area, the college’s major features are as follows. Walls The exterior walls are stone. The surface has begun tocrumble, and the clinging ivy makes climbing particu-larly difficult because the vines tend to tear away undera load. Thus, the DC for any Move Silently checks madewhile climbing an exterior wall increases by +5. ssIvy-Covered Wall: 3 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 270; Break DC 39; Climb DC 25. The interior walls are also made of stone. The surfaces are covered with smooth plaster. ssInterior Wall: 1 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 90; Break DC 35; Climb DC 20.Ceilings Unless otherwise noted, ceilings are 15 feet high on theground floor and 10 feet high on the upper floor. Floors The floors on the ground floor are made of smooth,fitted stones. The upper level has wooden floors. Rugsor carpets cover most of the floor area, but a fewsections are bare, as noted in the individual roomdescriptions. Doors The exterior doors are made of reinforced wood.Though all of them are equipped with locks, they arekept unlocked unless a particular threat necessitatesextra security. ssStrong W ooden Door: 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 20; Break DC 25; Open Lock DC 20. The interior doors are carved from simple wood. Most of them don’t have locks, but those grantingaccess to sleeping rooms and guest quarters do, as notedin the area descriptions. Interior doors aren’t lockedunless noted otherwise in an area description. ssSimple W ooden Door: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 15; Open Lock DC 20. Colver (the major domo; see Servant’s Room) and Noelin (the resident Yew Master; see Yew Master’sRoom) each have a set of master keys for all the doors inthe college. Fireplaces The college is equipped with several fireplaces for heat-ing and cooking. The building’s stone constructionensures that it remains cool and slightly damp even onhot days, so a small fire is usually kept burning in everyfireplace. A typical fireplace at the Fochlucan College measures about 5 feet high, 2 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. The chim-ney is about a foot square and 25 to 50 feet tall. (Thelonger chimneys begin on the ground floor.) A ceramiccap and copper grate at the top keep out the rain andsnow out and also prevent forest animals from entering.A Diminutive or smaller creature could climb inside achimney, but only if it entered via a fireplace or brokethrough the grate at the top. A Tiny creature couldenter a chimney the same way, but it would have tosqueeze in (see page 148 in the Player’s Handbook ). The outside of a chimney has a Climb DC of 25 (the same as an exterior wall), and the inside has a Climb DCof 10. However, the exterior is hot and smoky, and ittends to stay that way for about an hour even if all thefires in the fireplaces connected to it are extinguished.3 A creature climbing inside a chimney takes 1d4 points of fire damage each round from the hot surfaces andalso suffers the effects of heavy smoke (see page 304 inthe Dungeon Master’s Guide ). ssChimney Grate: 1 in. thick; hardness 10; hp 30; Break DC 26. Windows Every window is fitted with crystal-clear, leaded glassand a pair of simple wooden shutters. The windows areoccasionally opened for ventilation, but they can beclosed and latched to keep them from blowing open insevere weather. Likewise, the inhabitants can close andbar the shutters to keep the building snug in badweather. Normally the windows are kept closed but notlatched, and the shutters remain open. ssW ooden Shutters: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 13 (15 if barred). ssGlass Window Pane: 1/4 in. thick; hardness 1; hp 1; Break DC 5. Light Any room with a window has at least shadowy illumi-nation (see page 165 in the Player’s Handbook ) during daylight hours. Some areas are more brightly lit becausethey have extra windows or an artificial light source, asnoted in the individual room descriptions. GROUNDS The grounds occupy about 40 acres on the south shoreof Loch Firrnen, and the college itself stands about 10yards from the water’s edge. Scattered hardwoodtrees—mostly stately oaks, beeches, and assorted fruitand nut trees—grow throughout most of the grounds,providing a parklike atmosphere. Tall grass and a profu-sion of wildflowers cover the ground under the trees.",

Other popular oaths include \"By the Shalm!\" and \"His roots consume you!\" THE ETERNAL LIBRARY Knowledge equals power, and it is the only kind of power worth having. With the right knowledge, you can accomplish any goal, so you never rest in your search for information. The knowledge you find in the next crypt, the next dungeon, or the next hidden vault could make the difference between prosperity and poverty, or even life and death. Temples of the Eternal Library are always repositories of magical knowledge. Hidden catacombs and vaults beneath each site hold a priceless collection of ancient tomes on the nature of magic, as well as massive spellbooks and collections of scrolls, both arcane and divine. In addition, temples to Boccob frequently double as schools of magic, where students can learn arcane secrets from some of the most learned practitioners in the world—all for an exorbitant fee. The Church of Boccob has a small clergy that boasts nearly as many mystic theurges (DMG 192) as that of Wee Jas. However, a great many of the Eternal Library\u0027s active \"priests\" have no ability with divine magic whatsoever. A significant percentage of the highest-ranking members are actually wizards or sorcerers, and some are also loremasters (DMG 191). Services in the temple, when they are held at all, consist of lectures on new spells or on obscure bits of magical lore. Boccob\u0027s devoted realize that their patron doesn\u0027t care a whit whether they even worship him, so why waste their valuable time singing the praises of a deity they openly call \"the Un­ caring\"?
