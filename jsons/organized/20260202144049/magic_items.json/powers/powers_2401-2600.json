The lens fl oats in midair a few feet above the peak, and over the course of the next 10 minutes, a massive eyeball composed of bright fl ame appears 100 feet above the mountain peak. Once the Burning Eye forms, the magic event is active and no longer requires good weather above the mountain peak. Anyone looking through the diamond lens can clearly see a circular area with a 40-foot radius, even if it’s hundreds of miles away. As long as line of sight exists from the Burning Eye to the target area, it can be viewed through the lens. The area viewed through the lens is brightly lit (as a daylight spell) no matter what the weather conditions or time of day. It also provides a true seeing effect for the viewer. If the lens views the same area for 2 rounds in a row, the Burning Eye does more than just illuminate. It creates a fi re storm effect (as the spell, caster level 15th, Refl ex DC 20) that deals 15d6 points of fi re damage if the sun is shining on the mountain peak, 10d6 points of fi re damage if it’s daytime but cloudy, or 5d6 points of fi re damage if it’s night.
