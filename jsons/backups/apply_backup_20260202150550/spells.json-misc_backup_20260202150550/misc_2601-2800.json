In game terms, this means that a dragon can detect the presence of a potential encounter at twice the distance given in theDungeon Master’s Guide (see Stealth and Detection in a Forest, page 87, and other similar sections) .Also, when a dragon makes a Spot check, it takes only half the penalty for distance:a –1 penalty per 20 feet of distance rather than the standard –1 per 10 feet of distance. In dim light ,a dragon sees four times as well as a human. The dragon’s low-light vision is exactly like that of other crea-tures with the low-light ability, except that the dragon sees four times as far when using artificial illumination. For example, from a dragon’s point of view a light spell produces bright illu- mination in a 40-foot radius around the affected object and dim light for an additional 40 feet. In complete darkness, a dragon relies on darkvision and blindsense. Both are exactly like the standard abilities, except for the dragon’s exceptional range: 120 feet for darkvision and 60 feet for blindsense. In addition to their superior visual apparatus, dragons com- monly have ranks in the Spot skill.",

        "description":  "From 2nd level on, when a new dispas- sionate watcher level is gained, the dragon gains new spellsper day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcast-ing class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. Itdoes not, however, gain any other benefit a character ofthat class would have gained (an improved chance of turn-ing or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essen-tially means that the dragon adds the level of dispassionatewatcher to the level of whatever divine spellcasting classthe dragon has, then determines spells per day and casterlevel accordingly . If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a dispassionate watcher, the dragon mustdecide to which class it adds each level of dispassionatewatcher for the purpose of determining spells per day . A very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level dispassionate watcher has the spellcasting ability of a 13th-level cleric: 11 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spell-casting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from itstwo levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are addedto its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very oldamethyst dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, itsspellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spellsas a 15th-level cleric.Comprehend Languages (Sp): At 2nd level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use comprehend languages at will. Stunning Rebuke (Su): A 4th-level dispassionate watcher can deliver a thunderous rebuke that stuns onecreature of its choice within 100 feet. If the target creaturefails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dispassionate watcher’sclass level + 1/2 its Cha modifier), it is stunned for 1d4+1rounds. This is a sonic effect, but is not language-dependent. Tongues (Sp): A 5th-level dispassionate watcher can use tongues at will. Discern Lies (Su): At 6th level, a dispassionate watcher knows when anyone (other than a deity) is deliberatelylying. This ability is like the discern lies spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the dragoncan perceive. Clearsight (Ex): A 9th-level dispassionate watcher can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and dis-guised creatures and objects for what they really are, pro-vided they are within 30 feet of the dragon. This ability issimilar to the true seeing spell, except that it also foils mun- dane disguises. Vision (Sp): At 10th level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use vision three times per day . Using this abil- ity is only a standard action for the dragon. Analyze Dweomer (Sp): A 12th-level dispassionate watcher can use analyze dweomer at will. DRAGON ASCENDANT Easily the most powerful creatures native to the Material Plane, dragons hold a unique position in relation to thepowers beyond that plane. Those who become dragon as-cendants quest to transcend the limitations of materialexistence, rising above all other dragons to become noth-ing less than deities themselves. Their progress throughthe levels of this class represents their advancement towardtheir ultimate goal, and they become increasingly godlikeas they advance. Most dragon ascendants have not previously gained class levels, but all are dragons of considerable age andpower. A few dragon clerics, paladins, and blackguardsmove into the dragon ascendant prestige class when theyreach sufficient levels of power.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a dracolyte, he must decide to which classhe adds each level of dracolyte for the purpose of determin-ing spells per day . Prestige Domain (Ex): At 1st level, a dracolyte gains access to a prestige domain based on his alignment. Good-aligned dracolytes (and neutral clerics who channel pos-itive energy) gain access to the Glory prestige domain(and its granted power), while evil-aligned dracolytes(and neutral clerics who channel negative energy) gainaccess to the Domination prestige domain (and itsgranted power). Dracolytes who are neither good nor evil(and who don’t channel positive or negative energy) canselect either of these domains, but once made, the choicecan never be altered.

DRACOLICH The dracolich is an undead creature resulting from the transformation of an evil dragon. The process usu- ally involves a cooperative effort between an evil dragon and a powerful cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but especially powerful spellcasters have been known to coerce an evil dragon to undergo the transformation against its will. The dragon must first consume a lethal concoction known as a dracolich brew (see page 120). This act instantly slays the dragon, whereupon its spirit is transferred to its dracolich phylactery (also see page 120), regardless of the distance between the phylactery and the dragon’s body . A spirit contained in a phylactery can sense any reptilian or dragon corpse of Medium or larger size within 90 feet and attempt to pos- sess it. Under no circumstances can the spirit possess aliving body . The spirit’s original body is an ideal vessel, andany attempt to possess it is automatically successful. To pos-sess a suitable corpse other than its own, a dracolich mustmake a successful Charisma check (DC 10 for a true dragon,CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSIllus. by S.

If it pins the foe with whom it is grappling, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. Charm (Su): The voice of a vam- piric dragon can bewitch listeners.

This ability workssimilarly to a gaze attack, except that the vampiric dragonmust use a standard action, and those merely looking at thecreature are not affected.

Because ofthe creature’s utter lack of intelligence, the instructions givento a newly created zombie dragon must be very simple, suchas “Destroy anything that comes within sight.” Zombie dragons are often used as sentries (although they aren’t capable of calling for help, the sounds of the battle usu-ally serve to raise the alarm) or guardians. Draconic spell-casters capable of creating such creatures may use the bodiesof dead rivals or, in the case of particularly vile necro-mancers, deceased family members. CREATING A ZOMBIE DRAGON “Zombie” is a template that can be added to any dragon of atleast adult age (referred to hereafter as the base dragon). Thecreature uses all the base dragon’s statistics and special abil-ities except as noted here.",

Colder climates also slowthe rotting process, keeping the zombie white dragon intactfor a longer time. Combat The zombie white dragon possesses none of the animalistic ferocity it had in life. It merely acts according to the (simple) orders given it by its master. Its blindsense and keen senses make it an excellent guardian, and its icewalking ability allows it to perch in diffi- cult-to-reach places. Breath W eapon (Su): 40-ft. cone, 2d6 cold, Reflex DC 13 halves. Frightful Presence (Ex): 150-ft. radius, HD 14 or fewer, Will DC 14 negates. Icewalking (Ex): This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy . It is always in effect. Keen Senses (Ex): A zombie dragon sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 feet.",

In the example, Rimelost 2 points of Charisma, which lowers his Charisma mod-ifier from –2 to –3. If the dragon is a spellcaster, a change inCharisma also affects the save DCs for its spells and thenumber of bonus spells it gets. A dragon needs a Charismascore of at least 10 to cast any spells. Since Rime has no spell-casting ability, spell-like abilities, frightful presence, orCharisma-based skills, his reduced Charisma score has noreal impact.

The reason behind this uncharacter-istic behavior is a gnoll cleric who has taken Poccri’sdestruction as a personal quest in honor of Erythnul.

Sheexpends all her energy fighting the gnolls where she canand seeking allies in the desolate land of her territory .",

While other bronzes maybe content to let evil dragons make their lairs nearby andhatch who knows what evil plans, Eyruaad believes intaking the fight right to evil’s front door. He does not tol-erate any evil creature’s presence anywhere near his (rathersmall) territory, especially evil dragons. He uses a widenetwork of animals and humanoids to keep him informedof attacks by evil creatures, and personally investigateseach such report in order to protect the innocents in hiscare. His major failing is an eagerness to do battle, withlittle regard for his actual chance of success. So far, his luckhas not failed him, but it might not be long before Eyruaadneeds protection himself.",

However, when she can’tavert a fight through intimidation, frightful presence, orrepulsion gas, she tends to fly away, usually with a comment such as, “You’re not a worthy challenge!” She saves her bel-ligerence for evil creatures, of course, and is quite kindamong friends and like-minded allies—as long as no onecalls her bravery into question.",
