Lore of the Guild: Despite the care of individual members to keep their activities secret, a few rumors and tales of the Shadowmind Guild’s exploits have reached the general populace.

TALESPINNERS LEAGUE Centuries ago, some members of the College of Con - crescent Lore objected on philosophical grounds to the organization’s secretive approach to information. Their desire to share information with outsiders literally tore the college in two. The disaffected members formed the Talespinners League, a college devoted to the free ﬂow of information. Since that time, league members have honed their performance skills and branched out beyond the history and arcana studies that Concrescent Lorists favor. Many Talespinners are bards, but occasional arcane spellcasters are also welcome, especially if they are members of the virtuoso prestige class. The Talespinners League collects every kind of lore imaginable. Not as academic as the College of Concrescent Lore, Talespinners study down-to-earth topics such as the everyday traditions of various cul - tures. Members spend their time gathering all kinds of information.  Rather than relying on academic reports to disperse it, the league embeds its lore within historical or fictitious tales. Any member is free to specialize if desired, but anyone can change specialties at a moment’s notice. The Talespinners League is based on the master-appren - tice relationship. New students learn lore from masters and eventually become masters themselves. The mas - ters in each region meet once or twice a year and make any necessary decisions by a simple majority vote.

Once that part of the meeting is over, other invited members arrive, and the gath - ering becomes a grand exercise in tale-swapping.

The league’s motto is “The heart of the tale is in the telling.” Talespinners don’t wear robes, but many add blue and white tassels to their clothing.

EPIC-LEVEL PRESTIGE CLASS CHARACTERS The Dungeon Master’s Guide has information on advanc - ing the standard classes beyond 20th level. You can also advance the class level of a ten-level prestige class beyond 10th level, but only if your character level is already 20th or higher. You cannot advance the class level of a class with fewer than ten levels beyond the maximum described for that class, regardless of your character level. When your epic-level character advances a prestige class beyond 10th level, follow all the rules presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide . In addition, you must create an epic-level progression for your prestige class, just as the Dungeon Master’s Guide presents epic-level progressions for the classes from the Player’s Handbook . Many, but not all, class features continue to accumulate after 10th level. The following guidelines describe how to create an epic class progression, and are followed by a sample epic progression for the dungeon delver prestige class (see page 42 ). — Your base save bonuses and base attack bonus don’t increase after character level 20th. Since you can’t achieve 11th level or higher in a prestige class without being at least a 21st-level character, there are no columns for base saves or base attacks for these classes beyond 10th level. Instead, use Table 6–18: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses, page 206 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide , to determine a character’s epic bonus on saving throws and attacks. — You continue to gain Hit Dice and skill points as normal beyond 10th level. — Generally speaking, any class feature that uses class level as part of a mathematical formula, such as a shadowbane inquisitor’s smite damage, continues to increase as normal by class level. However, any prestige class feature that calculates a save DC using class level (such as the ghost-faced killer’s frightful attack) should add only half the character’s class levels above 10th. Thus, a 14th-level ghost-faced killer’s frightful attack would have a DC of 22 (10 + class level up to 10th + 1/2 class levels above 10th) + Charisma modiﬁer. Without this adjustment, the save DCs for epic-level character prestige class abilities increase at a much greater rate than those for normal class abilities. — For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after 10th level at the same rate it did during the ﬁrst ten levels of the prestige class. Thus, a 13th-level vigilante adds 13 to his caster level derived from another class to determine total caster level. However, spells per day don’t increase after character level 20th. — The powers of familiars, special mounts, and animal companions continue to increase as their masters gain levels, if they’re based on a formula that includes the character’s level. — Any class features that increase or accumulate as part of a repeated pattern (such as a dishonorable dread pirate’s sneak attack) also continue to increase or accumulate after 10th level at the same rate. An exception to this rule is any bonus feat progression granted as a class feature. If you get bonus feats as part of a class feature, these do not increase with epic levels. Instead, these classes get a new bonus feat progression (which varies from class to class; see below). — In addition to the class features retained from non - epic levels, each class gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or ﬁve levels after 10th. This bonus feat augments each class’s progression of class features, because not all classes otherwise improve class features after 10th level. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that every character gets every three levels (as per Table 6–19: Epic Experience and Level-Dependent Beneﬁts, page 206 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). — You don’t gain any new class features, because there aren’t any new class features described for these levels. Class features with a progression that slows or stops before 10th level and features that have a limited list of options do not improve as you gain epic levels. Likewise, class features that are gained only at a single level do not improve. SAMPLE PRESTIGE CLASS EPIC",

        "description":  "EPIC LEVELS AND PRESTIGE CLASSES The epic rules allow you to go beyond the normal level limit in a prestige class, but only if it is a ten-level class. Why can’t you add levels to a prestige class with fewer than ten levels? It’s Too Easy: Maxing out a ten-level prestige class takes a lot of time and effort, detracting significantly from your pursuit of the core classes. Even after maxing out a prestige class with only five levels, for instance, you haven’t taken more than a short detour from your main class or classes. It’s Not Significant Enough: Characters with ten levels in the assassin prestige class undoubtedly think of themselves as as - sassins, regardless of the fact that they also have ten levels in one or more other classes. If you’ve taken fewer than ten levels in a prestige class, those levels represent a smaller fraction of your character’s identity. It’s Hard to Build an Epic Progression: With only a few levels to guide you, it’s hard to determine what an appropriate progres - sion of class features would be for the class. The rate of improve - ment of a special ability might be too fast to extrapolate over an infinite number of levels, or there might simply be too few class features to build a unique epic progression. That said, if your DM wants to allow a character to gain epic levels in a prestige class with fewer than ten levels in its progression, that’s okay. Work together with your DM to create an epic progression for the class (see the Behind the Curtain: Building an Epic Progression sidebar, page 210 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs190 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 191CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS  of skill are classic achievements for adventurers of all levels.

BLAST SHAPE INVOCATIONS Some of a warlock ’s invocations, such as eldritch spear,  modify the range, target(s), or area of a warlock ’s eldritch blast.  These are called blast shape invocations. Unless noted otherwise, eldritch blasts  subject to blast shape invocations deal damage normally in addition to imparting the effects described in the invocation description. A warlock can apply only one blast shape at a time to an eldritch blast,  and he can choose from any of the blast shape invocations that he knows. A warlock need not apply a blast shape invocation to his eldritch blast. When a warlock applies a blast shape invocation to his eldritch blast,  the spell-level equivalent is equal to the spell level of the eldritch blast  or of the blast shape invocation, whichever is higher. A warlock can apply a blast shape invocation and an eldritch essence invocation (see Eldritch Essence Invocations above) to the same blast. When a warlock uses an eldritch essence and a blast shape to alter an eldritch blast,  the spell-level equivalent is equal to the spell level of the eldritch blast,  the eldritch essence invocation, or the blast shape invocation, whichever is higher.",

Eventually they transcend their mortal forms and become elemental beings. Elemental savants often begin their careers as individuals intrigued by one or all of the classic elements. Before they ever take levels in the prestige class, these spellcasters typically ﬁ nd themselves drawn to spells of a particular energy type. These spellcasters ﬁ nd satisfaction in the unleashed purity of the elemental energy forms, and they become elemental savants to grow closer to the element that becomes their favorite. Most elemental savants start out as warmages, wizards, or sorcerers, although divine spellcasters are not unknown in the class. A cleric with the Fire, Water, or Sun domain could also qualify for this prestige class. NPC elemental savants usually prefer to pursue their studies in solitude or in the company of other elemental savants. Sometimes groups of them gather in places where an element ’s majesty and power is on display, such as the ﬂ anks of a volcano, an island, or a high, windy mountain.",

        "description":  "At 10th level, an elemental savant, through long association with elemental entities and exten- sive study of their secrets, completely transcends her mortal form to become an elemental creature. Her type changes to el- emental. She no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe (though she must still rest to regain spells). She gains an elemental creature ’s immunity to stunning, and she is no longer subject to extra damage from critical hits or ﬂ anking. An elemental savant gains the speed and movement modes, natural attacks, special attacks, and special qualities of a Medium elemental of the type appropriate to her elemental specialty, as noted in the Monster Manual,  except that the save DC against her elemental attack form, if any (whirlwind, burn, or vortex) is 20 + her Con modi ﬁ er. Upon achieving this state, an elemental savant ’s appearance undergoes a minor physical change, usually to the skin or eyes. An earth elemental savant, for example, might acquire gemlike eyes and hard, pebbly skin. Anyone who shares the elemental savant ’s predilection for study of her chosen plane immediately recognizes her transcendent nature. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks when interacting with creatures that share her elemental subtype (air, earth, ﬁ re, or water) and with other elemental savants who have chosen her element. Unlike a normal elemental, an elemental savant retains a soul separate from her body. She can be raised from the dead as normal for a creature of her previous type. Energy Immunity (Ex):  From 10th level on, an elemental savant gains immunity to the type of energy associated with her chosen element. SAMPLE ELEMENTAL SAVANT",

A few make their own luck. A fatespinner (also called a “mage of many fates ”) has pulled back the curtain of chance, circumstance, and chaos to glimpse a deeper truth: probability. When one event occurs, innumerable possible ones do not as the universe blindly seeks balance. Through his newfound understanding, the fatespinner satis ﬁ es that blind seeking —with prejudice. He can increase the probability of events in his favor. Any arcane spellcaster who has cursed his bad luck is a candidate for this prestige class. Who has not cast a spell, hoping fervently but impotently for a particular outcome, or sadly noted the astounding luck of an enemy who resists spell after spell? The fatespinner seeks to apply some control over the seeming vagaries of chance —fortune for himself, misfortune for his foes. NPC fatespinners are often found in positions of power and authority, as would be expected from those able to directly affect their own destiny.

Spin Fate (Ex):  A mage of many fates understands that “chance ” is not as random as many believe it to be, and he can adjust the probability of certain events by applying a force that fatespinners refer to as “spin. ” Each day , a fatespinner can use a number of points of spin equal to his fatespinner class level. As a free action, a fatespinner can use stored spin to boost the save DC of a spell he casts, adding some or all his spin to the DC, on a point-for-point basis. For instance, a 5th-level wizard/3rd-level fatespinner casting ﬁ reball  could choose to boost the DC of the spell by 1, 2, or 3 points. Once he uses up his spin for the day, his ability to tinker with probability in this fashion is also exhausted for the day. A fatespinner ’s spin is replenished whenever the character successfully regains his spells for the day (whether through rest, preparation, or prayer). Fickle Finger of Fate (Ex):  O n  r e a c h i n g  2 n d  l e v e l ,  a fatespinner gains the ability to affect the luck of others. Once per day as an immediate action (see page 86), he can force any other creature —friend or enemy —to reroll a roll that it has just made. A fatespinner must have line of sight to the creature to be affected. That creature must abide by the result of the reroll, whether it ’s higher or lower than the original roll. Spin Destiny (Ex):  Beginning at 3rd level, a fatespinner more clearly comprehends the matrix of reality and can use accumulated spin to adjust other random events. The method is identical to increasing a spell ’s save DC, but the fatespinner can now add spin to any skill check, attack roll, or saving throw that he attempts on a point-for-point basis. However, the spin utilized comes from the same limited reservoir of karma storage that allows him to adjust the DC of his spells. He must apply the bonus before making the roll. Deny Fate (Ex):  At 4th level and higher, a fatespinner has a better chance of beating the odds should he ever be rendered unconscious and dying. Once per day, on the ﬁ rst occasion when a fatespinner must make a check to become stable when dying, the check automatically succeeds. Other such checks called for later in the same 24-hour period are made normally. Resist Fate (Ex):  A fatespinner of 4th level and above embraces his extraordinary good luck. Once per day, he can reroll one roll that he has just made. He must abide by the result of the reroll, even if it ’s worse than the original roll. Seal Fate (Su):  A 5th-level fatespinner can meddle in suc- cess and failure, and even life and death, sealing the fate of a friend or foe. Once per day as a free action, the fatespinner selects a target creature he can see within 30 feet with Hit Dice equal to or less than his. The creature receives either a –10 penalty or a +10 bonus on its next saving throw, as decided by the fatespinner. If the selected target has more Hit Dice than the fatespinner, the ability doesn ’t work but the use for the day is not wasted. This effect lasts only for 1 round, so if no spell or other effect is brought to bear on the target creature during the round, the creature ’s fate is no longer sealed. SAMPLE FATESPINNER",

The master transmogri ﬁ st is a sorcerer or wizard who has chosen to specialize in spells that change his form. The polymorph  spell and other shapechang- ing transmutations offer the master transmogri ﬁ st the ability to become a fearsome juggernaut of physical battle, a swift- ﬂ ying traveler, or the perfect spy. Since a character must achieve a signi ﬁ cant level of competence as an arcane spellcaster to qualify for this prestige class, virtually all who choose this path are sorcerers or wizards. Of the two, sorcerers are more often drawn to the spon- taneity and inventiveness offered by the polymorph spell and other spells like it. NPC master transmogri ﬁ sts delight in dem- onstrating their prowess with their favorite shapes, and are thus sometimes amenable to putting on a show for powerful kings, wizards, or other transmogri ﬁ sts.",

She can expend a use of bardic music or seeker music to instantly transport herself to any other spot within 25 feet + 5 feet/level. This ability otherwise functions as the dimension door  spell, except that the seeker can ’t bring along additional creatures with this ability. Dirge of Songdeath (Su):  A seeker of the song of 9th level or higher with 22 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over sonic energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to sonic 15. An ally bene ﬁ ts from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing.  In addition, as long as the seeker is singing a dirge of songdeath, other creatures within 30 feet cannot easily use bardic music, seeker music, or similar abilities. To use such an ability, a creature within the area must make a Perform check opposed by the seeker ’s Perform check. If the check is successful, the creature can use the ability as desired. If the check fails, the ability has no effect, but a daily use of the music ability must be expended normally.",

The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 15d6 points of sonic damage to a creature it hits. Note of Solitude (Su):  Upon reaching 10th level, a seeker of the song with 23 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use the power of the primal music to temporarily sever some creatures ’ tie with other planes. Extraplanar creatures within 60 feet of a seeker who activates this ability must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the seeker ’s ranks in the Perform skill). Creatures affected by this ability get a bonus on this saving throw equal to their Hit Dice. Any creature that fails this saving throw is instantly sent to its home plane. Unlike other musical abilities and affects, a note of solitude has a duration of instantaneous and cannot be maintained, though the seeker can activate it again on subsequent rounds by spending additional uses of bardic music or seeker music. Combine Songs (Ex):  A seeker of the song of 2nd level or higher can combine two types of bardic music or seeker music to provide the bene ﬁ ts of both. The seeker chooses two music abilities and activates both using the same standard action. If either or both require concentration, the seeker can maintain concentration on both by using one standard action each round to concentrate. The normal stacking rules for bonus types apply to music abilities combined with this ability. Subvocalize (Ex):  At 5th level and higher, a seeker of the song can begin a new bardic music or seeker music song as a swift action (see page 86). A seeker can use this ability only if he already has one (and only one) bardic music or seeker music ability already active. A seeker can use this ability in conjunction with the combine songs ability to start a second song and then maintain both as a standard action each round (as per the combine songs ability). Ex-Seekers of the Song Like a member of any other prestige class, a seeker of the song can take levels in other classes after entering the seeker of the song class, but seekers of the song face a special restriction. A seeker of the song who gains a level in any other class after having gained his ﬁ rst seeker level can never again raise her seeker of the song level, though she retains the seeker abili-ties she has already earned. The path of the seeker demands constant attention and devotion.

Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the sublime chord ’s Cha modi ﬁ er. A sublime chord can choose spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or the bard spell list; if a spell appears on both lists at different levels, she uses the bard version of the spell. A sublime chord ’s caster level for both her sublime chord spells and the spells she gains from other arcane spellcasting classes is determined by adding her sublime chord level to her level in another arcane spellcasting class. If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a sublime chord, she must choose to which class to add her sublime chord levels for the purpose of determining her sublime chord spellcaster level. A sublime chord prepares and casts spells just as a sorcerer does, including the ability to replace a known sublime chord spell with a new spell at every even-numbered class level beginning at 4th. Bardic Knowledge:  A sublime chord continues to col- lect the odd bits of lore and knowledge that bards acquire.
