Before playing his lute, Gimble listens to the dwarves’ But partway up the slope, a goblin scout begins pelting him with drinking songs so he can judge their mood. Doing so improves his sling stones. Krusk needs to make a Climb check to get up to the performance, giving him a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. His goblin, and this time he can’t simply take 10.

In other words, eventually you will get a 20 bonus to add into his skill modifier. Instead, the DC goes down.) on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill The leader of the dwarven band, however, has heard that a gnome check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.

Common “take 20” skills include Escape Artist, Open rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move Lock, and Search. actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long For example, Krusk comes to a cliff face. He attempts to take 10, activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity for a result of 16 (10 plus his +6 skill modifier), but the DC is 20, and (see Action Types, page 138).

Sometimes you want to do something that seems practically She estimates that the floors, walls, and ceiling of the cave make up impossible. In general, a task considered practically impossible has a about ten 5-foot squares, so she tells Krusk’s player that it takes 1 DC of 40, 60, or even higher (or it carries a modifier of +20 or more minute (10 rounds) to search the whole cave.

Now Krusk’s player treats his roll as if it were 20, The DM decides what is actually impossible and what is merely for a result of 19.

In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety if they’re all to get to the top. Regardless of Krusk’s roll, the other measure —you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed characters need successful checks, too. Every character makes a skill but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the check. average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help (such as using Climb to ascend Aid Another a knotted rope, or using Heal to give a wounded PC long-term care).
