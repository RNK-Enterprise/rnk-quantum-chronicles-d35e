They are preyed upon in turn by giant eagles, griffons, and larger snakes such as king cobras. A sailsnake also makes a meal for a shocker lizard clutch that survives its attack. Sailsnakes can live up to twelve years, but in the wild a life span of fi ve to seven years is more typical. The mating season is very short, just a couple of weeks in the early autumn. During this time, the males become vibrantly col- ored and quest about restlessly in search of females. Females are very picky and might not mate at all in a season if they fi nd no one to their liking. A compat- ible pair stays together during this time. The sailsnake mating ritual is a rare but wondrous sight—the pair entwine in free fall, then separate and spread their sails just before impact. The snakes go their separate ways after the season ends, and the female locates a suitable nesting area in the hollow of a tree.

ECOLOGY Dryads or nymphs who mate with verdant princes, or who are themselves evil, sometimes give birth to verdant princes. Verdant princes mature swiftly after birth, becoming full- grown and independent after a season. Powerful and convinced of their superiority, verdant princes care little for their mothers and typically despise their fathers, even if either parent was also a verdant prince. Like many other fey, verdant princes are nearly immortal. Verdant princes have a diet much like that of humans but require one-third of the food a human of the same size needs. Thus, verdant princes have little impact on the envi- ronment and often rely on fey servants to fetch them what they require.",

It charges toward the nearest opponent and pqqqqqqqqqrs fi ghts until the foe is dead. It then switches to a different 198 NREZ STNEMIREPXE opponent, and so on, until it dies or its opponents are all defeated. Zerns see blade thralls as disposable resources. A zern always puts its safety above a thrall’s well-being, and the thralls are bred to willingly accept even suicidal orders from their masters. For example, a thrall might barrel through a rank of enemy fi ghters, accepting attacks of opportunity, to attack an enemy spellcaster or archer. Although blade thralls are skilled combatants capable of dealing great damage, most zerns see them as little more than mobile shields. Usually, a thrall makes a few attacks at the start of a battle. If its attacks are ineffective, the zern commands it to focus on defense, especially when facing a foe that the thrall cannot possibly overcome. In this case, the thrall’s sole task is to protect the zern. It fi ghts defensively or even takes the total defense action to hold out as long as possible. A blade thrall might also use the aid another action, usually to improve the zern’s AC. Blade thralls also serve zerns by capturing living creatures. They are trained to wield nets and use them to entangle and neutralize promising test subjects. Once a creature is trapped and subdued, the blade thralls drag it back to the zerns’ lair. Sometimes the zerns sell blade thralls to other races. The thralls obey their new masters as faithfully as they would zerns.
