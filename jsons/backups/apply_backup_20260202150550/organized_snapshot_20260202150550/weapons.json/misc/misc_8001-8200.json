The Mythic System is intended own, power enough to equal that of even the mightiest to supplement, rather than replace the existing rules for spells. This means that they are ideal candidates for use magic item creation provided in Core Rulebook I and in the creation of magical items. Exotic components are Core Rulebook II.

Components in all cases, these rules are intended to supercede can take almost any form but are subject to the specific those found in Core Rulebook I and II but only for the requirements of the item they are intended to be used purposes of using the Mythic System. to create. In addition, creature components must be relatively intact, or their magic will not work; this means that while a gorgon hide with a few sword holes in it is still acceptable as a creature component, a half- 4422 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM disintegrated dragon skin which is mostly composed spiritual, or otherworldly locations, like grass from of cinders is not. Creature components can only come the rolling fields of fae, or lava from the boiling heart from creatures which have supernatural powers, or of the Ninth Plane of Hell, or a chunk of altar from a which are innately magical; creatures of the animal deity’s throne. The exact nature of the non-material and vermin types are not normally suitable sources of component which is acceptable for use as an exotic creature components. Typically, the more powerful material in the creation of a magical item depends the item which is to be created, the more powerful on the powers of the item to be created.

Chunks of tree bark, fist- winter, the deepest shadow in the under earth, the sized diamonds and pieces of marble taken from final memories of an ant crushed beneath a giant’s consecrated altars are all examples of non-animate heel and the first lie told by an honest man are all exotic materials. Non-animate components need not examples of esoteric components. In essence, if it be taken from innately magical objects (bark from cannot be held in the hand, if it cannot be carried in a dryad’s tree, dirt from a saint’s burial mound) but a box, or if it is only an idea, a thought, a memory often are. Typically, non-animate components are or a concept, then it is an esoteric component. One otherwise mundane materials which are harvested of the most important aspects of gathering esoteric from locations which are touched by supernatural, components is intent; no matter how skilled the adventurer, no matter how wise, no matter how fortunate, an esoteric component cannot be gained through happenstance, nor may it be gathered ahead of time, ‘just in case’. Instead, an esoteric component can only grant a magical spark if it is gathered expressly for the purposes of crafting a specific magic item (though the Games Master is of course free to disregard this rule in the interest of creating a good adventure). Uses for Exotic Materials Exotic materials can be used in several fashions, each with its own set of specific rules and requirements. These specific rules are outlined following the universal limitations which are described below. † An individual exotic material can only be applied to a single use outlined below. So, if a crafter wishes to use exotic materials to both replace needed spells and to defray experience point costs involved in creation, then he must use two different exotic materials. † Two identical exotic materials cannot be used to fulfil multiple purposes. That is to say that, for example, two phoenix pinions cannot be used to both replace a needed spell and to defray 4422 43 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM experience point costs. The same general type of † Exotic materials are always, without exception, exotic materials can be used, however, meaning two consumed or drained in the item creation process. different creature components could be used for two This does not, however, mean that a true name or different purposes. other, similar object or concept of similar cosmic import is destroyed.

Using Esoteric Components Esoteric components are perhaps the most mythic of all the mythic components, or at least the ones most likely to evoke memories of fairy and storybook tales from childhood. Unfortunately, they are also the most likely of the exotic materials to evoke painful memories of new age, feel-good, faux mythic hokum, the sort of stuff which is the bane of good fantasy literature. So how do you stay on the right track? By Games Mastering boldly. The worst way to introduce esoteric concepts into your campaign is timidly and apologetically. Remember that the thematic inspirations for esoteric concepts have existed for thousands of years. If esoteric concepts are good enough to form the basis of society building myths, they are certainly good enough for your campaigns. That said, there are few things worse than an esoteric concept which is overly twee, precious and pretentious. Esoteric concepts should be bold and should be based around strong, easily understood ideas. Look to real world mythology for inspiration, as well as to fairy tales and the fantasy stories of the golden age of 20th Century fantasy. A good esoteric concept is one which can be summed up in only a few words and which does not require you to embellish it with words best left to the pages of bodice-ripping romance novels. As a good rule of thumb, an esoteric concept should involve no more than 3-4 key descriptive words: the first snowflake of winter, the scream of a dying god, the shadow of a demon’s tear, that sort of thing. You want us to find a What? Esoteric concepts as exotic components can be a hard sell to roleplaying gamers for two reasons. First, much of the d20 fan base is drawn from those who are most familiar and comfortable with sword and sorcery tales, a genre which tends towards the down to earth and which concerns itself more with glittering jewels and notched iron than it does with eye of newt and seventh sons of seventh sons. Second, the historical culture of fantasy gaming is one which concerns itself primarily with the tangible, even where magic and spirituality is concerned; rewards of gold and titles, monsters which give physical embodiment to evil, avatars of gods which stride the earth, treasures and spell components which can be picked up and clenched in a heroic fist. Given the above, it is to be expected that Players may be taken aback when you first tell them that, to forge the mighty sword Nightbane, they must capture the true name of bats and trap the hangman’s shadow in an ivory box. To avoid this, it is best that you insure that the Player’s first exposure to esoteric concept components be a gradual one. Mention the use of esoteric concepts in the histories of famous magical items, or in the flavour text describing the exploits of the campaign world’s most famous and chronicled heroes. An effort can be made to use reasonably tangible elements in the first esoteric concepts introduced into the campaign. A quest to find the first blossom of spring on the mountain of Foozle is a good example of a esoteric concept with some very tangible elements; Mount Foozle is a definite place and a blossom is an object the Players can (metaphorically) grasp, so it fits into the scheme of tangible reward for achievement of a tangible goal which is at the heart of d20 fantasy gaming. You should also not be afraid to use real world mythological, fairy tale or fantasy literature examples to illustrate what you are trying to accomplish. Do not be afraid to directly tell Players that you are ‘wanting this adventure to be like the Earthsea books’, or that you want the campaign to evoke Norse mythology. If you give Players good, solid reasons for the use of esoteric concepts, then they will rise to the occasion and willingly suspend their disbelief. 4444 THE MYTHIC SYSTEM Using Exotic Materials to Replace Needed Spells component must come from a location or object which possesses ambient magic of some sort.

To do otherwise is to risk the wrath of even the most understanding of divinities. † In order for a mortal hero to gain the benefits of patronage, he must complete a quest of a magnitude suitable for the power of the item to be crafted. Most often, the hero agrees to destroy a powerful opponent of the god who is sponsoring him; in such cases, the hero must singlehandedly slay the monster or being, and the monster or being must have a challenge rating equal to or greater than either the caster level of the item to be crafted or the hero’s own character level, whichever is higher. The quest can take other forms as well, with the difficulty of the quest directly related to the power of the item to be created. Examples of appropriate quests include the construction of a church in hostile territory, the conversion of a certain number of worshipers (numbering in the thousands), or the restoration of the faith of a fallen member of the faith (a task which will require far more than the use of an atonement spell). † Once given, patronage lasts only until the hero successfully crafts the specific magic item, or until the quest is abandoned.

The best way to that you should use the reduced price when calculating combat this is to provide them with opponents who just how much magic is appropriate for a character at can plausibly challenge them without need of magic each level.

Standard This is the default level of magic item ability, at least according to the guidelines presented in Core Rulebook II. Since so much has already been said about gaming at this level of power, we will not spend too much time here. It would behoove you, however, to keep the issues raised by lowering or raising the availability of magic items in mind, since the issues raised there may bring to light concerns in your own game. Rare In a campaign in which magic items are rare, several adventures, or even levels, might pass between the acquisition of each magical item, making each such item, no matter how humble or mighty, precious to both characters and Players. There are, of course, varying levels of rarity, from campaigns in which adventurers, kings, powerful monsters and mighty Non-Player Character spellcasters have standard levels of magic items while others are lucky to buy the occasional potion, to worlds in which the concept of even a high level adventurer carrying around more than two items each will be completely alien. Regardless of the degree of rarity, you should keep these issues in mind. Rarity breeds greed. If the Players know there are only a handful of gauntlets of ogre power in the world, be prepared to watch them fall all over themselves to take them, by any means necessary, should they meet any Non-Player Character who owns a pair. On the good side, this allows you to use magical items as adventure 5544 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS carrots, leading the Players and their characters eagerly fore; since their damage resistance can be more easily from plot to plot.

This may be fine for you and may well characters with gold pieces instead of magic swords, fit your Games Mastering style, but do not forget that you should either simply reduce the expected reward Players hunger for the opportunity to play with the or replace it with other, less tangible prizes. The toys they work so hard to earn. One way to encourage chief reason for doing so is this; in a campaign where your Players to spend precious charges is to offer them characters do not earn magic items instead of gold, assurances that they will be able to replace them in or cannot simply spend their jewels on magic items, some fashion, perhaps by ‘coincidentally’ placing a enormous stacks of gold and jewels are meaningless, similar item in a treasure hoard just as the character’s since nothing short of buying a small country will is down to its last charges. ever deplete their purses.

Another solution is to restrict use of the In a world where magic items are extremely rare, Mythic System to the creation of more powerful magic permanent magic items should be the rule, rather than items, or to simply rule that the Mythic System can the exception. Be prepared for Players to ruthlessly only be used with your approval.

The Mythic System is easily integrated into low magic The Mythic System is also built around the assumption worlds and, in fact, may prove to be the best system that the divinities of your campaign world take at least for use in such campaigns, as the extra effort required an occasional interest in the doings of its heroes and to create items will serve as a natural limiter for the adventurers.

The Mythic System You might also wish to restrict the use of the Mythic as the Basis of System to members of specific races. The obvious choices should you choose to do this are elves and Adventures and dwarves, as the ancient histories of both races lend Campaigns themselves well to the flavour of the Mythic System. Of the traditionally Non-Player Character races, dragons, The hunt for a particularly rare or difficult to procure giants and other ancient and powerful beings are well component makes for a compelling adventure hook and suited to the themes and mechanics of the Mythic one which is thematically in line with the conventions System.

This means it will for the far-ranging, adventurous feel of this system) be important for you, as the Games Master, to give or to the more barbaric cultures, such as orcs and the other Players reasons to be enthusiastic, lest the half-orcs, since the idea of forging magical tools from adventure bog down the flow of the campaign. If components gathered by spilling blood and seizing the the component is suitably rare, or if the creature it reins of destiny is as barbaric as it gets.

So, for this reason, you should not theme adventures fresh and exciting. a component quest adventure around the creation of a potion of cure moderate wounds, since your Players will, rightly, either just cast the spell themselves or commission a local cleric to do it for them. Beyond that, if they must face death and worse each time they want to brew a healing draught, they will, probably both loudly and vehemently, wonder why it is that anyone would ever bother to do it. Beware of every adventure becoming, by default, a component harvest. Should you find that the Players are chopping up every monster they fight into its component bits and then scooping them into jars, or if they begin to break off chunks of every strange looking piece of tree, rock and lichen they find, or if you notice a marked increase in their fervent prayers to their deity of choice (or of the moment), then it is a safe bet that your Players are component harvesting. While you may not have a problem with it, it can slow the game down, since your Players will spend so much of their time bookkeeping and asking you ‘does this look useful?’ to which the usual answer is ‘could be’. In addition, rampant component harvesting can also spoil the flavour of the Mythic System, reducing it to a game of ‘raid the wizard’s pantry’, or a dangerous quest into the castle basement. It is relatively easy to discourage component harvest, fortunately. The easiest way to do it is to remind the Players that the components they harvest can, and will, rot long before they will see use. In addition, you are well within your rights to rule that, without taking special precautions, the majority of the usable parts of the creatures they slay will be rendered unusable by the ruthless application of sword and spell. 5588 59 HELP FOR GAMES MASTERS ‘We have seen it through to the end, my brother.’ Rogerio hefted his mug in his right hand and, wincing, flexed the shattered remnants of his left. Their fellow drinkers and revellers – sycophantic revellers one and all – were all dropped and spent. Only the hulking barbarian and the bard-that-was remained awake in the inn, surrounded by the broken furniture and empty flagons that spoke of a truly great celebration now ended. ‘As I knew we would.’ ‘Really? Did you now?’ Thorvald nodded and belching loudly, absently wiped froth from his mouth, spilling yet more beer down his ceremonial tunic. It had previously been a beautiful garment, gifted by the noble House of Armoricus itself for Thorvald’s sterling service to the Father of All Winters. Rogerio smiled, ruefully. ‘Yes. Yes, I quite believe you did.’ Rogerio shook his head. ‘And people say I’m the overconfident one. Of course,’ he said, draining the remnants of his cup ‘they’re right in that.’ ‘You’ve told the toad of our deed?’ Thorvald belched again. ‘No need. Word preceded us. We, my friend, are infamous.’ Rogerio leapt onto the table, staggered over the remnants of the venison and fell heavily, scattering bits of potato and bread everywhere. ‘Or, at any rate,’ he said, poking his finger at Thorvald, ‘more infamous than we already were.’ Thorvald nodded and pounded the table with a fist. ‘Good. Then he will help us?’ ‘No need for that either.’ Rogerio said. ‘Don’t you hear it, my friend? The Father of Winters is creeping around in my head and whispering secrets.’ ‘I hear nothing. ‘ Rogerio grinned, the broken ruins of his teeth still glittering, white as snow. ‘Not even an echo? On a still day, you can hear the sound of a rabbit’s fart across a flat plain! I’d think even the deaf could hear a god stomping around in your head.’ ‘I say again that I cannot.’ Thorvald was suddenly serious. ‘Do you think something is wrong with me?’ ‘Undoubtedly. Would you like a list?’ Rogerio sat up and swung his legs down over the side of the table, scattering tawdry trinkets – gifts from doxies, mostly – and discarded food around himself. ‘Seriously though, my brother,’ he said, rummaging through his pockets for his pipe, ‘I know you have the spark inside you now, just as I do. I sense it, if you do not. On the morrow, we will fire those sparks and our weapons will sing with the power of endless winter.’ ‘Aye, they will.’ The big, rough-bearded man cracked his knuckles and leant back, nearly toppling the rude bench he was perched on. Frowning his beetled brow, he shoved a comatose partygoer onto the stone floor. The girl landed in a heap, hiccuping lightly in her sleep. ‘Now,’ Rogerio said, throwing himself down onto the bench next to Thorvald, ‘we’d best see what we can do to scare up some more beer. Tomorrow we will participate in the making of a miracle. And I make it a policy to never participate in such events sober.’ 6600 DESIGNER\u0027S NOTES Designer\u0027s to really build on the idea of magic items as an integral part of an adventurer’s capabilities, an idea which the core rules are already built around. The magic item Notes quirks should work to make each item you create more unique and to bring d20 magic items more in line with their legendary and fictional inspirations.

The I will start this off the same way I always do, by problem with this book was not coming up with the thanking my wife and children, who keep me sane idea of what I wanted to accomplish but narrowing and humble, at least when they are not driving me down the number of ideas. ‘Write a book about magic crazy and telling me how wonderful my writing is items for us’ – may as well ask me to ‘write a book (every writer needs at least one groupie). about stuff’. A book about magic items can take just about any form and in the years since the release of I also want to thank the guys at Mongoose for giving d20 fantasy gaming, a book in just about every one of me a chance to write this book and for giving me those forms has been released. There are books which money for doing it. Hooray! are simply lists of new magical gear, there are books which provide detailed histories for artefacts, there I would like to sing the praises of the fine folk who are books of magical tomes and books of new magical wrote the core rules for creating magic items. It is properties and everything else under the stars. Is there nice to finally have an actual set of rules, so that my room for anything new? Is it even possible to really wizards can make neat stuff, instead of always having present something new about magic items? to search around for the neat stuff created who-knows- how by ancient spellcasters. Well, I certainly hope so. Finally, I would like to thank all the writers, I guess if I can find any fault with the current rules for mythmakers and dreamers whose inspiration and magic items, it is that there is still a little too much imagination provided the framework upon which this dependence on specific combinations of feats and work and every other book ever written about fantasy spells, taking some of the wonder out of magic item gaming is built. Thank you all. creation. On the face of it, this is not really a fault, since mechanics work best when they are presented in Patrick Younts a fairly straightforward manner. The problem comes when those mechanics render the eventual flavour of the campaign mechanical as well. That is the problem I see with Core Rulebook II’s rules for magic; the need for specific combinations of spells eliminates some of the mythic element to crafting magical objects. That is why I created the Mythic System for this book. It is not a comprehensive rewrite of the existing magic system - it does not have to be, since the default rules are both useful and effective. Instead, it is a spice, a new layer of paint, a curtain if you will, which both works to make the system prettier and make the raw mechanics of creating magic items less obvious. I think the system works well and I hope you will agree. The rest of the book was written with the same goals in mind. The new options for intelligent magic items expand your creative horizons when making such items, so that you can make an intelligent item of almost any sort.

Chapter 5: Magic introduces spells and or chakras it can be bound to, and the effects of binding it magic items that have similar scaling effects. Any character, to each chakra. regardless of whether he can shape soulmelds, can gain access In general, binding a soulmeld to a chakra produces an to his personal pool of essentia by the selection of the proper effect similar to that granted by a magic item worn on the feat or other option. corresponding body slot. For example, binding a soulmeld to the throat chakra often grants the meldshaper abilities related to protection or discernment, CHAKRAS just as a magic amulet or scarab usually Chakras are the body’s ten centers of power: crown, feet, hands, arms, does. Other thematic ties link brow, shoulders, throat, waist, heart, and soul. the powers of soulmelds to their chakra Similar to and closely linked with ten of the magic item spaces on the body described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the ten chakras represent locations on the body where a meldshaper can place a soulmeld. Meldshapers have access to all their chakras for the purpose of shaping soulmelds to occupy them. CHAKRA BINDS A soulmeld can be bound to a chakra in order to gain a secondary (and often more potent) effect from it. Doing so cuts off the corresponding body slot from magic item use—binding a soulmeld to your feet chakra means you can’t wear magic boots, for example. A skilled meldshaper can bind some of his soulmelds to chakras to gain new powers from those soulmelds. When a meldshaper binds a meld to a chakra, it becomes supernatu- rally tied or affi xed to that body location. As a side effect of the chakra bind, the meldshaper loses the ability to benefi t from a magic item occupying the body slot associated with that chakra. A meldshaper can shape soulmelds to occupy any of his chakras even at 1st level. However, the chakras are defi ned by a relative level of power or diffi culty for the purposes of binding soulmelds to them. As a meldshaper increases in level, he learns to bind soulmelds fi rst to his least chakras (crown, feet, and hands), then lesser (arms, brow, and shoul- ders), then greater (throat and waist), and eventually to his heart and soul chakras. A meldshaper can only bind soulmelds to a limited Arstor, a Pentifex Monolith number of his chakras, but that number increases as he gains (see page 209) levels.

You might have had a fi erce sense of justice and good as a child, perhaps even considered the call of a paladin until you discovered that incarnum could transform good into a tangible force that you could hold in your hands. You might have discovered incarnum by accidental experimenta- tion, or another incarnate might have trained you. Perhaps you were admitted into an order of incarnates, or learned under the tutelage of a lone hermit, one of only a handful of incarnates in the world. Your meldshaping ability offers myriad opportunities for customizing your particular abilities, since so many soul- melds are available to you and each one can significantly shape your capabilities. Your alignment determines which soulmelds are available; you cannot shape a soulmeld with an alignment descriptor opposed to your own. These soulmelds encourage your combat abilities in a certain direction dependant on your alignment, so you should try to select feats that complement that combat style. If you’re good, Combat Expertise fits your combat idiom. If you’re chaotic, Dodge and related feats fit well. For the evil incarnate, Power Attack is a natural choice, while lawful incarnates favor Weapon Focus and other feats that grant a bonus on attack rolls.

        "description":  "with that feat, you can have two soulmelds occupying or bound to the same chakra. The totemist’s totem chakra is unusual in several respects. It does not correspond to any body slot, so soulmelds cannot occupy the totem chakra. For this reason, the totem chakra appears in parentheses at the end of this entry for totemist melds. When a totemist wishes to bind a soulmeld to her totem chakra, she must choose a different chakra for that soulmeld to occupy. Regardless of the chakra occupied by the soulmeld, however, the totemist can bind it to her totem chakra. This is an exception to the normal rule that a soulmeld can only be bound to the chakra it occupies. At higher levels, totemists gain the ability to change which of their soulmelds are bound to their totem chakras. Although this might entail a signifi cant change in the totemist’s appearance and abilities, no soulmelds actually change location on her body when she rebinds her melds. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Quarranal Rhiannavar is a 3rd-level duskling totemist. As a 3rd-level totemist, he has the ability to shape three soulmelds at a time (and his Constitution is 17, easily high enough to allow this). At the start of this day, he spends an hour selecting his soulmelds; he decides to shape sphinx claws, totem avatar, and blink shirt. His sphinx claws occupy his hands chakra and his blink shirt occupies his heart chakra. The totem avatar soulmeld can occupy the arms, feet, heart, or shoulders chakra. His blink shirt already occupies his heart chakra, so Quarranal chooses to place his totem avatar on his arms chakra. Quarranal has access to and can bind soulmelds to his totem chakra. When he shapes his soulmelds, he can choose to bind any one of them to his totem chakra. (None of them can occupy his totem chakra, however.)

For example, the market price for a +3 longsword is 18,315 gp, but you can make one in nine days for only 9,315 gp, plus some experience points. Make liberal use of this benefit by manufacturing the best weapons and armor you can and using them with pride. Don’t be afraid to sell your weapon-making skill to your adventuring companions either. If you make items for your friends, you can give them a 20% or 30% break on the market price and still keep a comfortable profi t for yourself. You rarely want for money or equipment, since you can make the items you need and support yourself through your craft. Largely for that reason, the guild doesn’t supply cash or items to its members at all. However, the clerics of Moradin hold your skills in the highest regard, so you can expect a 25% discount on spellcasting services or cleric-crafted magic items in the Soul Forger’s temples. In exchange, you are expected to lend your considerable skill to crafting weapons and armor for Moradin’s servants from time to time.

The origins of this organization are as shadowy and sin- ister as necrocarnum itself. Few know of its early days, but those who do whisper of an ancient and powerful creature that taught the fi rst necrocarnates their craft and drew them together. Necrocarnates believe that this being still exists and serves to this day as the driving force behind the union, guiding the hand of Akker Zemd. On the rare occasions that they speak freely, these sages of necrocarnum lore claim that the shadowy master behind the union desires nothing less than the destruction or corruption of every mortal soul. Some claim that it is a powerful lich—the last survivor of some long-dead empire who has been driven insane by millennia of undeath. Others insist that the union is just another facet of a plot designed by the devious mindfl ayers, and still others hint that some powerful demon lord or evil deity is behind the organization. But whatever its origin, the union is clearly a force for utter evil built on a mutual lust for power. NPC Reactions Only evil creatures ever have friendly attitudes toward necrocarnates. In normal society, they are shunned and even hunted by those who understand the evil that they represent. Even people who do not understand necrocarnum or the evil nature of its use are repulsed by the twisting, haunted visages that swim visibly beneath the surface of every necrocarnum meld. Necrocarnates wishing to enjoy the comforts and resources of ordinary civilized cities must conceal their activities, refrain from shaping necrocarnum melds, and deal only with closely trusted associates or servants too cowed by their power to oppose them.

Your philosophical viewpoint dictates your position on the war. If you are inclined toward good, you favor working against the demon lords at all costs; if you are inclined toward evil, you prefer to curry the favor of the evil princes in hopes of gaining a reward in this life or the next.

Thus, your tactics change throughout an encounter to refl ect the shift of power from your spells to your soulmelds. Your ability to bind your soulmelds to your chakras significantly increases your versatility. Some soulmelds might become constant companions for you. In such cases, you must strike a balance between your favorite soulmelds and your spells with respect to essentia investment, and that balance might change throughout the day.

Umbral disciples can serve as spies, assassins, or wan- dering troubleshooters, depending upon the nature of their septs. An evil sept might secretly amass infl uence, eventually becoming the power behind the throne in a strife-riven kingdom. A neutral sept might simply serve as a conduit for information about the adventurers’ evil nemesis, or its members might accept payment from that same nemesis to punish intrusive heroes. Daily Life Since umbral disciples are wanderers at heart, they place little importance on material wealth and creature comforts. Because an umbral disciple travels lightly and often, it’s a rare day when he awakens in the same town as he did the previous day. Occasionally, however, he might be ordered by his sept master to serve a particular person or cause, sometimes for months or years at a time. Septs accept commissions for various kinds of activities and provide personnel to carry them out. For example, a sept might be retained by a powerful noble house to pro- vide a guard for one of its important members, to supply a suitable spymaster to advise the leaders of the house, or to hide an important person or item in the safety of its hidden fortress. When not actively working on an assignment, the mem- bers of a sept are expected to contribute to the organization’s storehouse of information. All members are exhorted to take a keen interest in the affairs of the people around them and report their discoveries to their superiors, who add that knowledge to the sept’s wealth of hoarded information.
