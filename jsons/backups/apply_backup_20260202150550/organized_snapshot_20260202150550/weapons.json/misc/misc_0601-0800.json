Parties with access to fly or levitate have a distinct advantage, as do those with effective ranged weapons. Think twice about using this encounter against a party that has ready access to true seeing or similar effects, since it relies heavily on illusions. You can insert this scenario into any section of deep, natural caverns. As the PCs approach the chamber, they hear the crash of falling water ahead of them. A Listen check (DC 10) reveals that most of the sound comes from water splashing down from a height, such as a waterfall or rapids. There’s no telling how big or far away this rushing water is without getting closer. When the PCs push ahead, read the following text. You come to a crooked finger of rock that juts out in a wide pool of dark, turbulent water. Darkness hides the pool’s far side. The ceiling is oppres- sively close overhead.

The characters’ actions dictate whether they fight both opponents, side with one creature against the other, or play them off against each other. The Huge gray render in this encounter has developed an attachment to a solitary earth mephit. At first, the mephit didn’t understand why the mas- sive creature was bringing it gifts, but it eventually came to accept the gray render as a sort of pet, unimaginatively naming it “Grey.” The two of them lived in this cavern for a number of years. True to form, the mephit also had a strong interest in geology. It had slowly amassed an impressive rock collection, including many different types of rocks and gems. A xorn named Xflox discovered this area while foraging. After she burrowed up into the middle of the mephit’s collection and began consuming it, the mephit and gray render immediately attacked her. The xorn quickly killed the mephit. The player characters approach just after the mephit has died.

Second, the Dungeon Master’sGuidepresents options for grant- ing XP to characters who overcome challenges that have nothing to do with slavering monsters or deadly traps. If the DM is willing to construct encounters or entire adventures where a pacifist char- acter’s skills at negotiation and other means of dealing with seri- ous noncombat situations are tested, she can award XP for noncombat encounters, as described in the Dungeon Master’sGuide. A free-form XP system is another way to handle games that de- emphasize combat. Characters receive a number of XP per char- acter level per encounter (75 XP per level works well), per game session (depending on the length of your sessions, 200–400 XP per level is a reasonable range), or per adventure (again depending on the length of the adventure, 500–1,000 XP per level, bearing in mind that 1,000 XP per level equates to gaining a level). Even characters who have sworn a vow of peace can and should receive XP for combat encounters that involve the destruction of constructs and undead. These unliving creatures are not covered by a vow of peace, and destroying them can be an appropriate goal for the most exalted character. Likewise, the DM should give full normal XP for combat encounters where pacifist characters subdue or otherwise incapacitate opponents. Other types of encounters the DM might consider granting XP awards for include the following: • Redeeming an evil character. This is worth an additional award (assuming an initial award for subduing the character) equal to the award for defeating the character in combat. • Negotiating to avoid combat or avert a larger confrontation. This is worth an award at least equal to the award that would as extreme in works of charity as she is in self-denial.

While the fists of Raziel take the fight against evil onto evil’s home ground, the defenders of Sealtiel remain at home, guarding against evil’s counterassault. Most defenders of Sealtiel are paladins, fighters, and rangers. Occasionally clerics or monks (often multiclass cleric/fighters or the like) adopt the class as well, and even more rarely, fighter/rogues take up Sealtiel’s cause. Arcane spellcasters rarely find the class appealing. The wandering life of an adventurer does not easily suit most defenders of Sealtiel, who prefer to stay in civilized regions to protect people. Sometimes, however, a defender of Sealtiel takes on the role of a bodyguard for an important or holy person, and travels with that person wherever necessity leads. Player character defenders could easily fall into that category, or feature prominently in a campaign that revolved around the defense of a city or citadel. NPC defenders are usually found in sedentary roles such as these.",
