SYNOPSIS This is a section of the upper Undercity that has been cleaned up and renovated to be used as a base by a gang of thieves and bandits. They are led by a medusa sorcerer who has been robbed of her gaze attack. She uses her magic to enhance the bandits, and the aid of a cleric of Phaant provides them with magic crossbow bolts to make them more effective raiders. The ban- dits are not associated with the Golden and may come under attack from the thieves’ guild, eventually. There are many weak creatures in this place that won’t pres- ent much of a challenge to the heroes, but the leaders are a respectable threat. THE BASE The bandits have cleaned out eleven buildings in the northern part of the Undercity and walled off the nearby streets with piles of rubble. The place is now much like a fortress and is hard to notice because the bandits are careful not to use lights outside their homes unless absolutely necessary (they use lanterns and candles within the buildings, and the windows have been covered over to prevent light leakage).

The counterweight buckets are hauled into the air by a winch system and held in place by a latch. The light trebuchet, by contrast, uses a bulb-shaped counterweight built into the swing arm. This arrangement makes the light trebuchet significantly easier to use than the heavy trebuchet but limits its range and can make the engine unstable if it’s not winched or loaded properly. Loads of shot launched by a heavy trebuchet deal damage to all creatures within 2 squares of the target square. Loading a light trebuchet requires three full-round actions. Loading a heavy trebuchet requires six full-round actions. Reaiming a trebuchet requires four times as long as loading it, and the weapon cannot be reaimed while it is loaded. If the check to load a light trebuchet fails by 5 or more, the weapon tips over, dealing 4d6 points of damage to all crew members (as well as any other creatures adjacent to it).

AERIAL BOMBARDMENT Many siege weapons hurl large objects, such as boulders, through the air to smash down upon the enemy. However, armies that deploy airborne troops can transport weighty objects into the air and drop them more directly upon foes.

Flyers with clumsy or poor maneuverability need to remember to leave themselves enough maneuver- ing room to avoid crashing into the ground or target (see page 20 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). VOLLEY OF ARROWS In most battlefield situations, archers don’t pick par- ticular targets for their shots. Instead, large groups of archers concentrate their shots on an area occupied by enemy troops, ensuring by sheer volume of projectiles that something will be hit. Despite the name of this tactic, it can be attempted by any characters wielding projectile weapons, such as crossbows or slings. The rule presented here originally appeared in a simpler form in Complete Warrior; this information updates and expands on that material. If at least ten archers are in a contiguous group (each one adjacent to at least one other), they can loose a volley of arrows as a full-round action. Rather than aiming at a specific target, they concentrate their arrows in a general area, hoping to hit whatever’s there. Each archer fires a single arrow, regardless of her normal rate of fire. The commander of the archers (generally an officer or trained for such missions, troops under the effects of a fly veteran soldier, who need not be one of the archers himself) spell, or a creature flying with a stack of rocks on a carpet makes a special attack roll against AC 15, using only his of flying.

In this way, the general’s advisors become just as much a part of the battle- planning as she is because of the strategic advantage they provide. Some terrain features can also provide a localized strategic advantage, for those attacking or defending. In game terms, a strategic advantage does what its name suggests: It gives an advantage to one side in a battle. Mechanically, this advantage is represented by the awarding of victory points (see page 78) before the start of battle. Most strategic advantages are gained through planning before the battle even begins, though some can be gained even if battle is joined without a plan, such as if an enemy force DEFLECTING A VOLLEY is ambushed.
