As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually bright- ens until the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal. Silver dragons are sometimes known as shield dragons because of the silvery plates on their heads. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until in the oldest the eyes resemble orbs of mercury. Silver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks or amid the clouds themselves. A faint smell of rain always accompanies them. Even in clouds, though, the lair always has a mag- ical area with a solid floor for laying eggs and storing treasure. Silver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and they often have mortal com- panions, even forming deep friendships. Inevitably, however, a dragon resumes its true form and departs for a time. Silver dragons have a taste for human cuisine and can live on such fare indefinitely. Because they lair in similar territo- ries, silver dragons and red dragons often come into conflict. Duels be- tween the two varieties are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the upper hand by working together against their foes, often with human allies.

        "description":  "+5 (cohort) This hulking biped has the mass of a giant. It has a stooped frame, a gray, hairless body, and broad shoulders. Its arms are long and sinewy, and its clawed hands scrape along the ground as it walks. Its sloped forehead bears six small, yellowish eyes. Its mouth is wide and powerful-look- ing, filled with black teeth. Bestial and savage, the gray render is a deadly preda- tor found in remote wilderness areas. These beasts are thought to be composed of dense muscle and bone, granting them the strength and stamina of a giant. A gray render stands about 9 feet tall in spite of its hunched posture and is about 4 feet wide. It weighs about 4,000 pounds. Rangers have reported seeing renders uproot trees 3 feet in diameter with their jaws and tear them into splinters in just minutes. Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of these asexual creatures produces one offspring and car- ries it for a time in a pouch, but thereafter the young render must fend for itself. YARG REDNER Gray render 138 Gricks lair in any sheltered space that can accommodate their bodies, including holes, burrows, ledges, and crevices. They do not col- lect treasure, but their lairs are likely to con- tain the uneaten possessions of their victims. When prey is scarce, gricks venture above- ground and hunt in the wilderness, using tac- tics similar to those they employ under- ground. These creatures are not comfortable under the open sky, however, and return to the subterranean world as quickly as possible. COMBAT Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their natural coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash out with their tentacles. A grick’s rubbery body seems to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, a grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at its leisure. A grick’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcom- ing damage reduction. Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or GRICK unconscious prey away.",

HARPY This creature looks like an evil-faced old human with the lower body, legs, and wings of a reptilian monster. Its hair is tangled, filthy, and crusted with blood. A more malignant and wretched creature than the harpy is difficult to imagine. Taking great glee in caus- ing suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always watching for new victims. A harpy’s coal-black eyes clearly reflect its evil soul, as do the wicked talons on its knotty fingers. These vile creatures wear no clothing and often wield large, heavy bones as though they were clubs. Harpies like to entrance hapless travelers with their magical songs and lead them to unspeakable torments. Only when a harpy has finished playing with its new “toys” will it release them from suffering by killing and consuming Harpy them. COMBAT 150 When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and strike with a melee weapon.
