If they’re clever enough to figure out they’ve been manipulated, they’ll be better prepared to defend themselves against the later manipulations of those who mean them harm. If they don’t fi gure it out, they’ll get tricked again, but that’s no concern of yours. Life is a game that you win by coming out on top, and the best way to do that is to convince others to give you a boost. You might adventure because you desire excitement. Someone with your smarts gets bored with mundane pursuits. Alternatively, you might have set off on a life of adventure after some trick or manipula- tion gone wrong. You have to keep moving, and adventuring offers you a regular change of scen- ery. In any case, a life of adventure allows you to see new things, meet interesting people, and garner a name for yourself. Of course, it might not be your real name, but fame is fame. You always look to expand your knowl- edge and increase your power. You are clever enough to know there’s always more to learn. Although you tend to be self- reliant, you understand the value of friendship and allies in your pursuits. Truth might be mutable, but friends value honesty and trust, so you make sure not to entan- gle your allies in your webs of lies and trickery.
