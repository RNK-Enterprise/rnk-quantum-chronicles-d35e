WILD PLAINS OUTRIDER The wild plains demand constant vigilance from those who wander their spaces. While moving through such areas, groups of nomads, adventurers, and even armies call upon the services of specially trained outriders. These scouts and wanderers work tirelessly to keep the plains as safe as such remote places can be. The many dangers of the plains necessitate trust between mount and rider, and the two must move as one—whether on a week-long trek covering hundreds of miles or in a short, bloody combat against a group of goblins. The wild plains outriders, a group of powerful rangers and druids who have gathered together to protect the plains and those who cross them, work to perfect this bond between mount and rider. Joining the wild plains outriders requires a special bond with a mount of some kind, so all outriders must have at least a few levels of druid, ranger, or paladin. Beyond that requirement, the life of an outrider demands survival, tracking, and combat skills that appeal more to rangers than to members of other classes. Although barbarians and scouts must multiclass before gaining levels in the outrider prestige class, they often ﬁnd the class appealing.

Adaptation:  The wild plains outrider prestige class can be tailored easily to ﬁt a speciﬁc campaign, race, culture, or organization. Simply add a minor aspect to the requirements. For example, specifying that an outrider’s animal companion or special mount must have a ﬂy speed and changing the name of the class to the “Skyt - hunder outrider” makes it a better ﬁt for a reclusive but powerful tribe of goblins called the Skythunder tribe. Similar changes can make the class ﬁt dwarf rangers on dire boars, elf foresters on giant lizards, or human nomads on wild horses.",

SKILLS Skill use is essential to every adventurer’s career, from the burly ﬁ  ghter who specializes only in climbing to the genius-intellect wizard with ranks in every Knowledge skill. COMBINING SKILL ATTEMPTS Teamwork is an oft-overlooked element of the D\u0026D game. It’s all too easy for the ﬁ  ghter to pay attention only when it’s time to swing his sword, or for the cleric to tune out during the rogue’s attempt to bluff the party past a guard post, but these characters are ignoring valuable opportunities to contribute to the group’s suc- cess. In addition to the aid another rule (see page 65 of the Player’s Handbook ), this section describes some new ways for characters to help their friends succeed.t takes more than just muscle or the ability to sling a spell to survive life as an adventurer. Regardless of how swiftly or accurately you swing a sword, or how devastatingly powerful your spells are, adventures invariably pose problems and challenges that require quick thinking, versatile abilities, and a little luck to survive. This chapter explores alternate uses for many skills, providing many new ways in which characters can use existing skill ranks to overcome different challenges. Skills, although one of the main focuses of this book, are but part of a character’s many abilities. The feats in this chapter speak to the versatility of the accomplished adventurer. Whether you’re a ﬁ  ghter wanting to handle tasks other than a toe-to-toe melee or a rogue looking to boost your combat ability, these new feats help shape a character into a more versatile, more durable adven-turer. Many of the feats emphasize skill use, opening up new ways to use existing skill ranks that would be too powerful to simply give to every character. Others focus on the rogue’s, ninja’s, and scout’s special attack forms. Finally, subsets of feats offer expanded uses for 95Illus. by D. KovacsCHAPTER 3 SKILLS AND FEATS 96CHAPTER 3 SKILLS AND FEATS 97Individual Events Even in some cases where several characters attempt the same action, with each succeeding or failing as a result of separate checks, characters can assist one another. By offering advice, guidance, or simply leading by example, a character can effectively share some of her expertise with her comrades. However, this activity comes at a cost, since the character’s concentration is split between multiple tasks (and thus she isn’t as capable at the task as she would normally be). A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill who is engaged in a task using that skill can voluntarily accept a –4 penalty on the check in order to grant a +2 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue can help her allies sneak through a dungeon. By accepting a –4 penalty on her Hide and Move Silently checks, Lidda grants Jozan, Tordek, and Mialee each a +2 circumstance bonus on the same checks. While Lidda isn’t as quiet and hidden as she’d normally be, the group overall is more stealthy than they would be without her help. At higher levels, a character can grant more assistance, but at a greater cost. A character with 15 or more ranks in a skill can accept a –10 penalty on the check to grant a +5 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. An ally must be within 30 feet of you to gain the bonus, and you must be able to see and hear each other. Using the previous example, if Lidda were invisible, she couldn’t grant the bonus to any character who couldn’t see her; if Mialee were invisible, Lidda couldn’t grant her the bonus unless she could see invisible creatures (but she could still grant the bonus to the other characters). Typically, only the following skills can be assisted in this manner: Balance, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Hide, Move Silently, Ride, Search, Survival, and Swim. In special circumstances, the DM may rule that other skills can beneﬁt from this assistance, or that characters can’t beneﬁt from this form of assistance even when using the skills described above. Aid Another The Player’s Handbook  describes how a character can help another character achieve success by aiding him with a skill check of the same type; a successful DC 10 check by the ﬁrst character grants a +2 circumstance bonus on the second character’s check to use the same skill (see pages 65–66 of the Player’s Handbook ). This section expands on that rule by allowing more skilled characters to grant greater assistance. When a character with 5 or more ranks in a skill uses the aid another action to assist another character’s skill check, he can grant a higher bonus than that described in the Player’s Handbook . For every 10 points of the helper’s check result above 10, the circumstance bonus increases by 1. Thus, a result of 10–19 would grant a +2 circumstance bonus (as normal), a result of 20–29 would grant a +3 circumstance bonus, a result of 30–39 a +4 circumstance bonus, and so on. (To determine the circumstance bonus quickly, simply divide the helper’s check result by 10, round down, and add 1.) This higher bonus is available only to helpers with at least 5 ranks in the skill being used. Only experienced characters have the ability to provide the extra assistance offered by this rule. At the DM’s option, this rule can also be extended to using the aid another action in combat to improve an ally’s attack roll or AC. Any character with a base attack bonus of +5 or higher can grant a greater bonus on an ally’s attack roll or AC as described above. This rule rewards the tactic of experienced combatants helping each other in a ﬁght (often the best option when ﬁghting a monster with an extremely high AC or attack bonus). Skill Synergy In addition to helping a character’s own skill checks, skill synergies can be used to aid the checks of allies as well. A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill that offers a bonus on another skill due to synergy can make a check using the ﬁrst skill to aid the skill that would normally receive the bonus from synergy. For example, Soveliss the 2nd-level ranger could make a Handle Animal check to aid Jozan’s Ride check (using the aid another rules described above and in the Player’s Handbook ), because a character with 5 ranks in Handle Animal gains a +2 bonus on Ride checks due to synergy. See Table 4–5: Skill Synergies, page 66 of the Player’s Handbook . The normal rules for aiding another still apply. For instance, even if Krusk the barbarian had 5 ranks in Handle Animal, he couldn’t use it to aid Vadania the druid’s wild empathy check, because Krusk can’t make a wild empathy check himself. Some combinations may be difﬁcult to imagine, but the DM should allow any synergistic aid another attempt that seems reasonable. For instance, it might seem odd at ﬁrst glance for Mialee to use Spellcraft to assist Lidda’s Use Magic Device check when reading a scroll—until you imagine the wizard leaning over the rogue’s shoulder, helping her sound out the tougher words.EXPANDED SKILL DESCRIPTIONS The section below outlines new and clariﬁed uses for some of the skills in the D\u0026D game. The new and expanded actions described in this section are available to any characters who can normally use the skill unless otherwise noted.

Beneﬁt:  As a swift action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you can sacriﬁce one of your daily allot - ment of spells to add a bonus to your unarmed strike attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus is equal to the level of the spell sacriﬁced. The spell is lost as if you had cast it.

Using an alchemical weapon capsule requires only a swift action (and does not provoke attacks of opportu- nity) if it is held in a properly attached weapon capsule retainer (see below). Otherwise, applying an alchemical weapon capsule is the equivalent of applying a magic oil (a standard action that does provoke attacks of opportunity).",

        "description":  "The most common method of delivering the effect of an alchemical weapon capsule is the weapon capsule retainer. This long leather thong, wrapped around a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (but not a projectile weapon) just at the base of the blade or striking surface, holds a thin, ﬁ  tted ring sized for a single alchemical capsule. A more expensive option is the triple weapon capsule retainer, which stores three capsules rather than one. A character wielding a weapon with a triple retainer can use one, two, or all three capsules it holds as part of the same action. Only one weapon capsule retainer (or triple retainer) can be attached to any weapon.

If the save is successful, that oppo- nent takes only one-ﬁ  fth normal damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 20% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon). You can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell’s duration expires, whichever comes ﬁ  rst. SPEECHLINK",

Some members limit themselves to tracking down criminals; others are willing to hunt anyone for a client who can pay the price. The group’s leaders don’t concern themselves with such issues, only with maintaining the organization’s reputation as the place to go to ﬁ  nd someone. Bloodhounds can take any assignments they choose. Some jobs come directly from clients who contact indi- vidual members. Others come through the grapevine, since members pass word to each other. Individuals are ﬁ  ercely competitive, and if one succeeds where another has failed, the winner gloats over the victory. In fact, members often tell each other about the as-signments they’ve taken, in effect challenging to beat them to the mark (their quarry). Mem- b er s may work together, but most work alone or with nonmembers so that word spreads of their personal fame. Thus, whenever several Bloodhounds form a pos- se to catch a particularly elusive foe, word spreads far and wide. Despite this rivalry, when a mark is too important to go free, a member can spread the word of a “free” bounty among the Bloodhounds. This means that any member who brings in the mark can claim the prize. Members who spread free bounties lose no face in the organization for doing so. Bloodhounds resent the concept of giving their earn-ings to anyone. Thus, the organization does not demand a portion of its members’ income. No ofﬁ  cial guildhalls or strongholds exist because no self-respecting member would limit herself to one base of operations. Since so many of the group’s marks are human, rang-ers who have taken humans as favored enemies have an advantage in assignments. As a result, a large percentage of the membership is nonhuman, and differing alignments are rarely an impediment to teaming up.

Eventually the silver dragon’s eggs hatched, and as the dragons matured they learned of their great debt to the family. The young dragons left, and many human generations passed before one returned with a gift. Now grown to great power, the dragon Silverwing offered knowledge of the ﬁghting techniques of a long-lost group of warriors who had mastered subtle skills. After long periods of training under Silverwing’s tutelage, the new family warriors began to exact their vengeance for crimes long forgotten by the rest of the empire. They earned the name dragonblade ninjas from those few bystanders who saw them ﬁght and lived to speak of it afterward. Within a few years, every last descendant of the traitorous prince had been killed, and the family’s vengeance was complete. His debt repaid, Silverwing left the family to make his own choices about his role in the world. Gen - erations later, the family still remains in hiding, although it now recruits a few trusted individuals into its ranks every few years. Without the dragon’s guidance or the burning quest of vengeance to drive it, however, the family’s will has fragmented, and its warriors pursue diverse and sometimes conﬂicting goals. Some wish to reveal themselves and claim their right as a prominent family. Others wish to remain in hiding and use their skills for proﬁt and adventure. Still others take an even more sinister path, selling their lethal skills as assassins to anyone who can pay their high fees.",

EYES OF THE OVERKING As one of the premier information-gathering and espio - nage groups in the world, the Eyes of the Overking are respected and even feared by the few who know they exist. Born in service to a legend, the guild devotes itself to preparing the world for the return of the Overking, a near-mythical ﬁgure who supposedly once held the human, elf, and dwarf people united as one nation for hundreds of years.

These rulers cau - tiously pay the organization for its excellent intelligence work and its apparently loyal stance on national issues. Although the kingdoms that the Eyes serve occasionally Dragonblade Ninja Clan symbolIllus. by C. Lukacs172 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 173CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS  have conﬂicts between them, the organization never betrays conﬁdences between one kingdom and another and often works to keep nations on friendly terms (the better to prepare for their eventual reuniﬁcation). This approach makes the Eyes a subtle but powerful force for order in much of the world. They often put their inﬂuence and contacts to work directly against evil cults, kingdoms, and even powerful evil indi - viduals. While the organization remains focused on peace and unity, it is far from wholly good, and its agents do not hesitate to use blackmail, extor - tion, or even assassination to maintain peaceful relations between the diverse rulers that they support. Although many indi - vidual members join and serve the organization for much more practical reasons, the core of the organization remains focused on the Over- king’s return. Joining the Eyes of the Overking: The Eyes of the Overking constantly work to build new contacts, especially among ﬂedgling adventurers. These contacts include those with the potential to join the guild, those most likely to obtain rare or valuable information in the future, and those worthy of notice should they turn to crime. The Eyes prefer to approach potential members through intermediaries ﬁrst, measuring a potential recruit’s skill and resourcefulness while ensuring that she is likely to remain trustworthy. Whenever possible, they attempt to recruit entire adventuring groups, knowing that each individual in the group is more likely to remain loyal to the organization if she knows that her friends have also pledged themselves to the guild. Character Beneﬁts: Characters who belong to the Eyes of the Overking have access to missions and secret information beyond the reach of most other characters. The guild works tirelessly to track criminals, spy on the nobility, and defend the kingdom through all manner of espionage acts. These activities beneﬁt PCs associ - ated with the guild by providing endless adventure opportunities, but even more important, they provide connections and contacts among the highest ranks of the kingdom’s nobility. Depending on a member’s char - acter level and past successes, the organization should be able to provide an avenue through which she can have access to those in power within a community. Roleplaying Sug - gestions: The Eyes of the Overking maintain a veil of secrecy even though knowledge of their existence has generally spread through - out the populace. This policy prevents characters from re - vealing their afﬁliation with the organization in all but the most trying or im - portant circumstances. Therefore, membership has little direct effect on most roleplaying encounters except to emphasize the need for discretion. In general, members are observant, efﬁ - cient, and personable. One trait that the Eyes stress is the ability to act swiftly and decisively when needed. For this reason, members of the organization remain deceptively calm for long periods of time and then burst into short periods of activity. Once an agent decides to commit to a course of action, there is no holding back, and her swift - ness often catches opponents by surprise. Typical Member: The typical member of the Eyes of the Overking is a low-level rogue, bard, or scout. Because such individuals are often skilled in both disguise and melee combat, they work in subtle ways to keep the orga - nization’s leadership apprised of criminal and political events within the kingdom. They occasionally add num - bers to an important raid led by a higher-level member of the organization, and they often serve as guards in the organization’s safe houses and headquarters. Prestige Classes: High-level members of the Eyes of the Overking are spies of consummate skill, but few use exactly the same techniques. Most of the mid- and high- level members are rogues or ninjas, but many have levels in a prestige class as well. Members prefer training as spymasters, shadowminds, vigilantes, and bloodhounds, but they also take levels in prestige classes less obviously associated with espionage, such as loremaster.",

LEAGUE OF BOOT AND TRAIL Members of this unusual organization regard every road as a classroom and every inn as a laboratory. Devoted to travel for its own sake, they accumulate little lore but see much of the world—and worlds beyond as well. Anything of interest to travelers is of interest to the League of Boot and Trail. Although it is organized much like a college, the guild offers no formal academic studies; instead, its members are renowned guides and scouts. They know, for example, the last known location of a ﬂoating isle, the best way to cross the Midnight Desert, and which church now rules the province of Aramador. Because its members are rarely in the same place for long, the League of Boot and Trail has little formal organi - zation and no central leadership. Nearly every city of any size has a league station, where members can ﬁle reports on their travels, conduct research for future journeys, and share drinks and tales of the road. A senior member serves as station head at each location. If a crisis affects the guild as a whole, as many station heads as possible meet somewhere and reach a solution by consensus. Each league member must help to run a league station for one month out of every year. The most senior league member of a given month’s working group serves as sta - tion head. Each member who stops at a league station must ﬁle a report describing his or her travels since the last station stop. The report should include hazards, weather condi - tions, encounters, and any other information that might prove useful to other travelers. Each of the guild’s stations bears a red boot symbol. This same symbol also appears as a tattoo on each league member’s left forearm. Though wearing actual red boots is not required, most members do put red trim on their boots. In addition, every member carves two small notches in each boot heel so as to leave distinctive tracks. Occasionally, league members band together to bring to justice to anyone who displays a league tattoo but isn’t actually a member. The league pays handsomely for such services out of its own coffers, but most members would take on such tasks even without pay to protect the league’s reputation.Grayhaunt Investigators symbolIllus. by C.

        "description":  "Common, Dwarven; Gnome. Sneak Attack (Ex): Diesa deals an extra 3d6 points of damage on any successful attack against ﬂat-footed or ﬂanked targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discern - ible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Diesa can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack). Dwarf Traits:  Dwarves have stonecunning, which grants them a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of it can make a Search check as if actively searching. When standing on the ground, dwarves are exception - ally stable and have a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped. They have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids. Dwarves have a +4 racial bonus to Armor Class against giants. Their race also gives them a +2 bonus on Appraise or Craft checks that are related to stone or metal items. *Dwarves have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. Evasion (Ex): If Diesa is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reﬂex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Trapﬁnding (Ex): Diesa can ﬁnd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁnd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Diesa retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when ﬂat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile). Possessions: +1 chain shirt, masterwork whip, master - work sap, goggles of minute seeing, 2 potions of cat’s grace, masterwork thieves’ tools, 2 potions of hide from animals, 400 gp. LEAGUE OF BOOT AND TRAIL Members of this unusual organization regard every road as a classroom and every inn as a laboratory. Devoted to travel for its own sake, they accumulate little lore but see much of the world—and worlds beyond as well. Anything of interest to travelers is of interest to the League of Boot and Trail. Although it is organized much like a college, the guild offers no formal academic studies; instead, its members are renowned guides and scouts. They know, for example, the last known location of a ﬂoating isle, the best way to cross the Midnight Desert, and which church now rules the province of Aramador. Because its members are rarely in the same place for long, the League of Boot and Trail has little formal organi - zation and no central leadership. Nearly every city of any size has a league station, where members can ﬁle reports on their travels, conduct research for future journeys, and share drinks and tales of the road. A senior member serves as station head at each location. If a crisis affects the guild as a whole, as many station heads as possible meet somewhere and reach a solution by consensus. Each league member must help to run a league station for one month out of every year. The most senior league member of a given month’s working group serves as sta - tion head. Each member who stops at a league station must ﬁle a report describing his or her travels since the last station stop. The report should include hazards, weather condi - tions, encounters, and any other information that might prove useful to other travelers. Each of the guild’s stations bears a red boot symbol. This same symbol also appears as a tattoo on each league member’s left forearm. Though wearing actual red boots is not required, most members do put red trim on their boots. In addition, every member carves two small notches in each boot heel so as to leave distinctive tracks. Occasionally, league members band together to bring to justice to anyone who displays a league tattoo but isn’t actually a member. The league pays handsomely for such services out of its own coffers, but most members would take on such tasks even without pay to protect the league’s reputation.Grayhaunt Investigators symbolIllus. by C. Lukacs176 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 177CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS   For the most part, the League of Boot and Trail has few dealings with other organizations. However, its members gladly swap stories with any members of the Talespinners League they happen to encounter. Those who make their living catering to travelers treat Boot and Trail members well in the hope that more red-booted business will come their way.",

NIGHTSONG GUILD The Nightsong Guild has worked within the city for as long as most people can remember—and probably a good deal longer. Its members deal in matters not entirely legal as well as those quite clearly illegal—gambling, smuggling, blackmail, and theft. The guild’s reputation is one of extreme skill and competence. It is not feared as much as it is afforded the respect that it has earned. Most would refer to the Nightsong Guild as a thieves guild, but it is actually a far more extensive group than that. Its membership includes rogues, ﬁghters, bards, wizards, and sorcerers. Guild members do not take part in violent activities such as extortion or murder, for the guild leadership has long maintained that if you kill or intimidate your clientele, those people cease to make money (and if they don’t have money, the guild can’t make money). Of course, if one or more of its members are attacked or threatened with violence, the guild is quite clearly capable of dealing with the situation.League of Boot and Trail symbolIllus. by C.

ORDER OF ILLUMINATION Evil might lie behind any door, and shadow might hide in any heart. The Order of Illumination holds this maxim close as it seeks out and destroys evil wherever necessary. The organization has two main branches, each dedicated to fulﬁlling one of the order’s two functions. The ﬁrst is to ferret out evil wherever it hides, and it is the shadowbane stalkers who devote themselves to ﬁnding hidden evils and piercing the lies of evildoers. The second task is to confront these evils directly, and it is the shadowbane inquisitors who pick up sword and shield and take the ﬁght to evil creatures. Although many of its members adven - ture with their comrades (especially in partnerships between a stalker and an inquisitor) and with independent adventuring groups, the Order of Illumination is not an adventuring- oriented organization. The order is far more concerned with ﬁnding and combating the evils that hide within civilized communities than it is with ﬁnding lost tombs or raiding the lairs of dragons. The comrades are quick to praise such activity when it clearly serves the cause of good, but members are encouraged to look for evil closer to home whenever possible.",
