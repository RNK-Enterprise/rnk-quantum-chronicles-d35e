By taking spells. While metamagic feats are designed to do exactly 4 CHAPTER 1: ARCANE LORE this, most bump up the spell level farther than is practical this philosophy, you would pick Spell Focus in other when you’re just starting out. So, think about taking some schools, with Greater Spell Focus in one or more, possibly general feats first. with Spell Penetration and feats that enhance both spells A wonderful feat for both sorcerers and wizards is Spell and ranged weapons. Primary among these last is Spell Focus, which raises the save DCs of spells you cast from a Specialization (see Chapter 2: Feats): In conjunction with particular school. Of course, this feat also paves the way Point Blank Shot, you could be dealing +3 points of for Greater Spell Focus (see Chapter 2: Feats). The higher damage with your ranged attack spells. the save DC, the more likely you’ll affect foes with your Sorcerers should approach metamagic feats with spells. Spell Focus is useful far more often than Spell caution. When you use a metamagic feat, it’s a full-round Penetration, which is only beneficial against creatures action to cast the spell (see Casting Times in Chapter 5: with spell resistance, so it makes sense to take it first.

For a sorcerer, Spell Penetration for later, though, because eventually Quicken Spell isn’t worth even considering.

For example, at 8th level you can cast a 4th-level and would benefit most from Point Blank Shot and Precise spell at least three times each day, but you’ll only know Shot. Because ranged touch spells work much as ranged one. If you pick a useful spell such as polymorph self, weapons do, both these feats enhance them too (see improved invisibility, or dimension door, you have to give up Weaponlike Spells in Chapter 5: Spells).

Following efficacy even against creatures sleep can’t touch. 5 CHAPTER 1: ARCANE LORE As soon as your spellcaster can cast 2nd-level spells, choose one or more that enhance abilities. More than ever before, your ability scores determine how well you take and deal damage of all types. Since cat’s grace and endurance help any character, a sorcerer may decide to pick up one of these first, given his limited spell selec- tion. Bull’s strength is least useful to a spellcaster, but if the combat specialists in your party can count on you to enhance their Strength scores, you can count on them to protect you more effectively in a melee. Among the 2nd-level spells, invisibility is a great boon to wizards and sorcerers alike, especially if there’s a rogue in the party. Wizards also benefit from learning see invisi- bility early on, but the sorcerer’s limited selection makes that a spell he might want to skip until later. As your list of 2nd-level spells grows, consider hypnotic pattern (good for taking foes out of the fight or distracting potential foes without actually doing any harm) and levitate. No spellcaster can do without dispel magic, and it should definitely be one of your 3rd-level spells. A sorcerer may prefer fireball, lightning bolt, or fly as his first choice, but this one deserves to be the next. Its uses are legion: You can bring spell-using enemies down a notch by eradicating their ability enhancements, magical protections, and even their antimagic spells with a good roll. Good troubleshooting spells at 3rd-level include suggestion, invisibility sphere, and tongues. You also have some excellent party support spells to choose from, such as the amazing haste. Higher-Level Spells Once you have built a repertoire of 1st- through 3rd-level spells, you should have a pretty good idea of the type of character you’re playing. Sticking to that theme makes picking higher-level spells straightforward, although you can always shift your focus. to adventuring also have a variety of high-level spells Wizards available.

The text says the bonus increases by +1d6 every says the character can use the ranged legerdemain only a two levels but it does not say what the initial value of the certain number of times per day as determined by his bonus is. The table shows +3d6 damage at 2nd level, going level. It also says he can make only one ranged skill check up one die every 2 levels to +7d6 at 10th level. Also, it says each day, and only if he has at least one rank in the skill that this damage stacks with any other sneak attack being used. Doesn’t the second sentence contradict the bonuses. That would mean that an arcane trickster could first one? have a pretty darn good sneak attack (+5d6 at 2nd level It does indeed, and it’s an error. The second sentence when you consider the +2d6 the arcane trickster must should read: He can make a ranged skill check only if he has have to qualify for the class). Is that right? at least one rank in the skill. No. The text is correct and the table is wrong. The sneak attack entries on the table should read: 2nd level: +1d6; 4th Does the arcane trickster prestige class’s (from Tome level: +2d6; level: +3d6; 8th level: +4d6; 10th level: +5d6. and Blood) ranged legerdemain power make you use the This ability stacks with any other sneak attack the character same skill each time you use this power, or can you choose might have, so that a 10th-level arcane trickster has a sneak to use it for a different skill check each time?

Does this mean if one has, say, three attacks, the and halve the result if the save succeeds. impromptu sneak attack is a full-round attack for a single sneak attack roll?

In the case of multiple missile spells like lesser fire orb, is this modifier treated as +2 damage per missile?

(which can literally vibrate you to pieces). A magical silence No. You don’t use any tools at all with ranged effect; however, negates all sonic attacks. legerdemain. I have a question about the Split Ray feat in Tome and Is there an error in the table for the arcane trickster Blood. It states that only ray spells that deal damage can Tome and Blood FAQ 2 5/8/03 be split. Does finger of death apply, since it deals damage on a successful Fortitude save? You can’t use this feat on finger of death because it is not a ray. Note that the descriptive text for this spell should read: You can split the effect of a ray spell, which are spells that have an “Effect: Ray” entry. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the spell’s range and are also within 30 feet of each other. If the ray spell deals damage, each target takes half as much damage as normally indicated (round down). If the ray spell has a nondamaging effect, each target has a 50% chance to take the nondamaging effect. This could result in one, neither, or both targets taking the nondamaging effect. For example, you split a disintegrate spell. You roll to hit each target, and there is a 50% chance that any target you hit is subject to disintegration. A target subject to disintegration is allowed a normal saving throw. Failure results in disintegration and success results in 5d6 points of damage, divided by 2. If desired, you could make both rays attack the same target. A split ray uses up a spell slot zero levels higher than the spell’s actual level (the same level as the original spell). At 1st, 4th, and 6th level, the dragon disciple prestige class grants a Hit Die increase that makes your Hit Dice bigger. The ability description specifically says it is not retroactive, but what about future levels? If, for example, a 1st-level dragon disciple takes a level of sorcerer, is that Hit Die increased to a d6? If so, what happens if the dragon disciple chooses to take a level of fighter? Is that Hit Die changed in any way? You gain Hit Dice from the dragon disciple class according to the class chart. For other classes, you gain Hit Dice by class. For example, if you have 4 levels of dragon disciple, you’d gain 1d8 if you added a 5th level of dragon disciple. If you added a level of fighter, instead you’d gain 1d10. When your dragon disciple Hit Dice increase in size, your previous Hit Dice from the class do not increase retroactively. For example if you have 10 levels of dragon disciple, you’ll have 3d6 (for levels 1–3), 2d8 (for levels 4–5), and 5d10 (for levels 6–10). Does a person struck with a negative energy ray spell (from Tome and Blood) receive a saving throw or not? The spell header says “Will half (see text),” but the text makes no mention of whether the victim gets a save. I’m inclined to think there is no save since the caster must hit with a ranged touch attack anyway. Yes, negative energy ray spell allows a Will save. The “see text” entry refers to undead being healed by the ray. (For undead, negative energy ray is a harmless spell.) Tome and Blood FAQ 3 5/8/03",
