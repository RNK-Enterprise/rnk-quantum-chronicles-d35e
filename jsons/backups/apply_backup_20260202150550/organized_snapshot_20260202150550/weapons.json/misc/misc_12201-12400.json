        "description":  "Weapons of bronze, while clearly inferior to steel items, are not nearly as bad as stone or bone weapons. Their attack and damage penalty is only û1 rather than û2. Bronze has a hardness of 9 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Hafted weapons (that is, weapons with wooden shafts, such as axes and spears) use the values shown on Table 8û13: Common Weapon and Shield Hard- ness and Hit Points in the RNK Adventurer\u0027s Codex. Special Weapon Materials The various planes of existence are exotic, other- worldly landscapes where even the fundamental ele- ments of the universe may be drastically different than on the Material Plane. Extraplanar weapon- smiths use certain minerals from these planes, partic- ularly the Outer Planes, to make weapons with special qualities, and these weapons sometimes find their way to the Material Plane. Like adamantine, mithral, and darkwood, these materials bestow spe- cial properties on the items forged from them, with the particular benefit that these properties are not magical in nature (and thus do not go away in an antimagic field,for example).",

        "description":  "Deep in the mines of the Nine Hells of Baator, veins of green-flecked iron run through the rock. This rare metal, when alloyed into steel, can be used to create weapons of amazing sharpness. Any slashing or piercing weapon created with Baatorian green steel has a natural enhancement bonus of +1 to damage. This bonus does not stack with any other enhancement bonus. Thus, a green steel (+1 to damage) longsword with a +4 enhance- ment bonus effectively has a +4 enhancement bonus on both attacks and damage. In an area where magic does not function, it still retains its natural +1 enhancement bonus on damage. A masterwork green steel slashing or piercing weapon would have a +1 bonus on both attack and damage rolls (from a com- bination of masterwork and the green steel). Though green steel is a common component of keen weapons produced in the Lower Planes, it grants no other spe- cial ability to such weapons. The market price modi- fier for such a weapon is +2,000 gp. Baatorian green steel has a hardness of 12 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Gehennan Morghuth-Iron: This volcanic min- eral is unique to the steep mountains of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, where it is occasionally mined by neutral evil fiends called yugoloths and other creatures on that forbidding plane. It forges poorly, making weapons that appear pocked and pitted and have a û1 attack and damage penalty. However, morghuth-iron is extremely toxic, rap- idly poisoning the blood. A slashing or piercing weapon made of Gehennan morghuth-iron is naturally poisonous. The weapon delivers its poison (Endurance save DC 12) with each successful attack. The initial damage is 1 point of temporary Dexterity; the secondary damage is 1d4 points of temporary Dex- terity. The market price modi- fier for a weapon made of morghuth-iron is +4,000 gp. Gehennan morghuth-iron has a hardness of 9 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness.",

        "description":  "Mined on the fourth layer of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, this fine iron needs no alloy and shines with a silvery gleam.

Solanian truesteel has a hardness of 11 and 25 hit points per inch of thickness. NEW ARMOR TYPES The new varieties of armor described below supple- ment those described in Chapter 7 of the RNK Adventurer\u0027s Codex. Many use unusual raw materials, because armorsmiths tend to work with whatever they have at hand. Elves and druids locked deep in primeval forests, for example, find refined metal a rare com- modity. Surrounded by plants and magic, however, some elven smiths craft wonders out of their every- day environment. Armor Descriptions",

        "description":  "Similar to bone armor, wood armor is cloth or leather reinforced with strips of wood. Getting into and out of Armor The time required to don armor depends on its type (see the table below). ARMOR AND TECHNOLOGY As with weapons, different forms of armor in your cam- paign might be restricted to certain cultures, depend- ing on the level of technology available to those cultures. Champions of an ancient empire serving the Phara- onic pantheon and wielding bronze khopeshes shouldnÆt be decked out in steel full plate or even chainmailùtheyÆre more likely to wear bronze breastplates, at best. Historically, only a few exceptions to this rule exist, and they are all made of bronze.",

        "description":  "While the relative softness of bronze diminishes its usefulness in weapons, it allows elaborate sculpting of bronze breastplates, which makes this armor a favorite of some military commanders. It is also popular parade dress. A bronze breastplateÆs armor bonus is 1 worse than a steel breastplateÆs (+4), but its maximum Dexterity bonus is 1 better (also +4). Item Market Price Modifier Armor Equivalents For whatever reason, historical armor generally seems easier to categorize than weapons, and armor isnÆt subject to the same abundance of nomenclature that exists to describe weapons. There is therefore no need to provide equivalents for most forms of armorù there is a general understanding of what full plate or chainmail armor is, and you arenÆt likely to run across hundreds of variant names for these armors. As always, there are exceptionsùin this case, pri- marily the armor of the ancient Romans. Early Roman armor was called loricaùa hard leather cuirass similar to leather armor in RNK. The term expanded to include the three most common kinds of Roman metal armor: lorica segmentata (banded mail), lorica hamata (a chain shirt), and lorica squamata (scale mail). NEW ARMOR MATERIALS Just as mithral, adamantine, and darkwood can make fantastic armor and shields, so too can the materials described below do wonders in the hands of a compe- tent armorsmith. When a material improves the armor check penalty (that is, reduces it), it is shown on Table 1û11: New Armor Materials as a positive adjustment (+). If it increases the armor check penalty, it is shown as a negative adjustment (û).",

Although dense and weighty compared to other woods, it is still lighter than most metal: Items weigh 10% less when made from bronzewood rather than metal. Armor made of bronzewood is also less obtrusive than similar armor made of metal. The armor check penalty from bronzewood armor and shields does not affect Hide checks made in woodland environments.

        "description":  "Difficult to work and dangerous to obtain, the exoskeletons of massive insects are still used to construct weapons and armor, especially in areas where metal is scarce. Weapons and armor made from chitin weigh half as much as similar metal items. Although chitin can replace metal in most items, chain weapons such as the spiked chain cannot be made from it, nor can chainmail armor or chain shirts. Giant insects and similar creatures are the only sources of chitin plates big enough for crafting armor. To provide workable chitin, the creature must have a +5 natural armor bonus or better. Much as armorsmiths can make one suit of banded mail for a creature up to two sizes smaller than the source crea- ture, one suit of half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, there is enough material left over to create a large or small shield, one Large or Medium-size weapon, two Small weapons, or 50 arrow or bolt heads, provided that the source creature is Large or bigger.

        "description":  "Although barely malleable in its nat- ural state, this rough, gray stone can be shaped into weapons and armor in a process similar to sculpting. Also known as sea-stone, elukian clay is formed in part by seepage from the Elemental Plane of Water. It has a strong affinity to water, so those traveling in or over large bodies of water value it greatly. Items made from elukian clay do not count against the wearerÆs weight total when calculating armor check penalties on Swim checks. The spell failure chance for elukian clay armor and shields is increased by 1. Although it can be shaped into a point, elukian clay does not hold an edge very well. Only piercing and bludgeoning weapons can be made from elukian clay. Armor and shields made from elukian clay have their armor check penalty increased by 1. Once formed, an item made from elukian clay takes three days to harden. Items used before the hardening is complete are easily ruined; such items have 0 hard- ness and only one-tenth their normal hit points. Once dried, elukian clay items have a hardness of 10 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Shaping elukian clay into armor requires the Craft (sculpture) skill.

Rules Compendium isn’t just a compilation of the rules MATH you need to play D\u0026D. It’s also a celebration of the 3rd Edition of the world’s most popular roleplaying game. When doing math in D\u0026D, some conventions are in effect Those who’ve worked on the game in past years have taken unless a specifi c rule or description says otherwise. the time to comment on the rules and share experiences with you in these pages. You’ll find anecdotes, house Rounding Fractions rules, history, and more in these asides and essays. If If you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the the rules in this book don’t show you anything new, the fraction is one-half or larger. As detailed elsewhere in this designers, developers, and editors who commented here book, certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a just might. minimum of 1. Multiplying RULES BASICS Sometimes a special rule makes you multiply a number The D\u0026Drules have some essential assumptions. or a die roll. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value such as die roll modifi ers, combine them into ADJUDICATION a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less Essential to the D\u0026D game is the Dungeon Master (DM). The than its value to the fi rst multiple. Thus, a double (×2) and DM is the referee and storyteller for the game, as well as a double (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple the judge when the rules don’t cover a particular topic. (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3). Three doubles results in a quadruple Let’s face it: No set of rules can cover every possible (×4 because 2 + 1 + 1 = 4). When applying multipliers to what circumstance in a game meant to mimic life in a fantasy are considered real-world values (such as weight or distance), world. The rules clear up as much as possible, assuming the the normal rules of math apply instead. DM can make a judgment in a situation that the rules don’t ORDER OF RULES APPLICATION cover or that they don’t cover adequately. DMs are expected to use knowledge of existing rules, common sense, real- The D\u0026D game assumes a specifi c order of rules application: world knowledge, and a sense of fun when dealing with General to specifi c to exception.

An exception is a particular fail to directly forbid, as long as the DM thinks doing so kind of specifi c rule that contradicts or breaks another rule is reasonable. For example, the rules don’t come out and (general or specifi c). The Improved Disarm feat, for instance, say that a Medium creature threatens all squares within provides an exception to the rule that an attacker provokes 10 feet while wielding a reach weapon and wearing spiked an attack of opportunity from the defender he’s trying to gauntlets. However, it’s appropriate to assume the creature disarm (see Disarm, page 45). does just that. TIME The DM is also there to keep the game moving. Doing so might require expedient rulings that later prove troublesome Time works for characters in the imaginary world of D\u0026D or just plain incorrect. That’s okay. Players and DMs make like it does in the real world. Minutes, hours, days, and mistakes, and these mistakes tend to average out over time. months can pass as the characters explore and grow in power. It’s better for everyone’s fun if the game just keeps going Only during certain situations is the measure of time more rather than devolving into a rules argument or going back precise. Then the round is used. to revisit the round in which a mistake was made. Round Combat is played in rounds. Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world, regardless of how long it takes to play out the round. A minute contains 10 rounds. See Initiative, page 70, for more on beginning combat. 5 INTRODUCTION Ability Score Loss drains an ability score, no matter how many points it drains. Some attacks deal damage to an ability score in the form of Temporary hit points gained in this fashion last for up to 1 ability damage or ability drain. Ability damage must be healed hour.

Providing this sort of care is light activity and requires medical supplies. You can’t give long- term care to yourself. ABILITY DRAIN When an attack drains an ability score, it perma- nently reduces that score in a living creature (any creature not of the construct, deathless, or undead type). If a creature can drain an ability score, that creature’s descriptive text describes how it does so and which ability is drained, as well as the amount of that drain. On a critical hit, an attack that causes ability drain deals twice the indicated amount of drain—if the drain is expressed as a die range, roll twice as many dice.

Nordstrand ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY Battle Grid To help visualize the fi ctional world of the D\u0026D game, use of a battle grid and miniature fi gures is recommended. A battle grid consists of a grid of 1-inch squares. Each of these squares represents a 5-foot square in the game world. See the diagram for some specifi cs about the battle grid. Miniatures are metal or plastic fi gures used to represent characters, monsters, and scenery in the game. If you don’t have miniatures, you can use some other form of markers or tokens, as long as it’s clear which token represents which object or creature. You can use the grid, along with miniatures, to show marching order or the relative location of the characters in any given situation. As its name implies, however, a battle grid is best used in a combat situation. Then the grid helps everyone determine and regulate the distance between individuals, tactical movement, line of sight, areas of spells and effects, and so on. Sometimes position in combat makes the difference between life and death. The battle grid and miniatures help everyone agree on the locations of creatures and signifi cant objects. MEASURING DISTANCE When measuring distance on the grid, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on. Closest Creature When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures are equally close, determine the closest randomly. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs BRINGING THE GAME TO LIFE representations of the rooms of Undermountain.

Concealment encompasses all cir- for determining concealment from ranged attacks. cumstances when nothing physically blocks a blow or shot In addition, some magical effects provide concealment but when something interferes with an attacker’s accuracy. against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening Typically, concealment is provided by fog, smoke, shadowy concealment exists. illumination, darkness, tall grass, foliage, or magical effects EFFECTS OF CONCEALMENT that make it diffi cult to pinpoint a target’s location.

If a creature your target has concealment if its space is entirely within receives miss chances from multiple sources, such as from an effect that grants concealment, such as a cloud of smoke. being incorporeal and having concealment, only the highest miss chance applies. Hide Checks You can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Hide check. TOTAL CONCEALMENT If you have line of effect (see page 80) to a target but not line of sight (see page 81), that target is considered to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think that foe occupies. You can’t make attacks of oppor- tunity against an opponent that has total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies. Miss Chance A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy that has total concealment has a 50% miss chance. IGNORING CONCEALMENT Certain attributes allow a creature to ignore concealment, so concealment isn’t always effective. For instance, darkness doesn’t provide any concealment against an opponent that has darkvision. DEGREES OF CONCEALMENT It usually isn’t worth differentiating between more degrees of concealment. However, the DM can rule that certain situations provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs ROLL MISS CHANCE FIRST Although the concealment rules behave as intended—they make Many players get around that problem by simply rolling the you miss and feel very different from the rules for cover—they have miss chance before making an attack roll.

The price you pay is the change in initia- tive count and lost time. You never get back the time you spend wait- ing to see what’s going to happen. While delaying, you can’t interrupt anyone else’s turn the way you can with a readied action. HOW TO DELAY By choosing to delay, you take no ac- tion on your regular turn, then act normally on whatever initiative count you decide. You voluntarily change your initiative count for the rest of the combat. You can specify this new ini- tiative count, or you can just wait until a certain time and act then. CONSEQUENCES OF DELAYING When you act, your initiative count changes to the one on which you act- ed. Your initiative count is lower for the rest of the combat if you acted later in the same round during which you decided to delay. If you take your de- layed action in the round after the one during which you chose to delay, but before your original initiative count comes up, your initiative count rises to the one on which you acted for the rest of the combat.

If you’re attempting to disarm, follow the steps outlined here. Taking a held object that isn’t a melee weapon from an opponent requires the same sort of disarm attempt, as does grabbing an item the foe is wearing. You can’t use disarm against a natural weapon. INITIATING A DISARM When you attempt a disarm, you declare the item you’re trying to disarm, and you provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender—the creature you’re trying to disarm. If the defender’s attack of opportunity deals any damage, your disarm attempt fails. Otherwise, you and the defender make opposed melee attack rolls with your respective weapons or items. A wielder that is wielding a one-handed or two-handed weapon with two hands during a disarm attempt gets a +4 bonus on this attack roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty even if wielding that weapon with two hands. Unarmed strikes and natural weapons are considered light weapons, so you always take a penalty when trying to disarm an opponent while using one of these. If the combat- ants are of different sizes, the larger one receives a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per size category larger. If the targeted item isn’t a melee weapon, the defender takes a –4 penalty on the roll. RESOLVING A DISARM If you beat the defender, the defender is disarmed. If you attempted the disarm while unarmed, whether you’re con- sidered armed or not, you now have the weapon or item you targeted. The weapon is on the ground in the defender’s space if you used a weapon for your disarm attempt. If the defender wins and is considered armed with a melee weapon, that creature can immediately react and attempt to otherwise easy to snatch or cut away, such as a loose cloak or disarm you. This attempt doesn’t provoke an attack of oppor- a brooch pinned to the front of a tunic, you get a +4 bonus. tunity from you. If the defender fails its disarm attempt, you Unlike on a normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt don’t subsequently get a free disarm attempt against it. doesn’t allow the defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions identically to a disarm attempt. Grabbing Items You can’t snatch an item that is well secured, such as a ring You can use a disarm to snatch an item worn by the target.

Vohwinkel ETHEREALNESS Falling YIELDING SURFACES One of the most common hazards to adventurers is a fall Falls onto yielding surfaces also treat the fi rst 1d6 of damage from a great height. Another potential hazard is to have an as nonlethal damage. This reduction is cumulative with object fall on them. reduced damage due to deliberate jumps and skill use. WATER FALLING DAMAGE Falls into water or similar liquids are handled differently. If A creature that falls takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet the water is at least 10 feet deep, the fi rst 20 feet of falling fallen, to a maximum of 20d6. If a creature deliberately deal no damage. The next 20 feet deal nonlethal damage (1d3 jumps instead of merely falling, the fi rst 1d6 is nonlethal per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, a fall into water deals damage. A DC 15 Jump check or DC 15 Tumble check 1d6 points of lethal damage per 10 feet. allows a creature to avoid any damage from the fi rst 10 feet Creatures that deliberately dive into water take no damage fallen and converts any damage from the second 10 feet to on a successful DC 15 Swim check or DC 15 Tumble check, nonlethal damage. as long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet You can instead try to use Tumble to ignore falling damage. fallen. However, the DC of the check increases by 5 for every For every 15 points of your Tumble check result, you can treat 50 feet of the dive. a fall as if it were 10 feet shorter than it really is when determining damage. FALLING OBJECTS Just as creatures take damage when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when falling objects hit them. Falling objects deal damage based on their weight and the distance they have fallen. For each 200 pounds of an object’s weight, the object deals 1d6 points of damage, provided it falls at least 10 feet, adding an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 10-foot increment it falls beyond the first. Objects lighter than 200 pounds also deal damage when dropped, but they must fall farther to deal the same damage. Use the following table to see how far an object of a given weight must drop to deal 1d6 points of damage. This is also the increment at which the object deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. A falling object can deal a maximum of 20d6 points of damage. Objects weighing less than 1 pound don’t deal damage to those they land upon, no matter how far they have fallen.

ATTACKING A helpless defender takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged attacks. Its Dexterity score is considered to be 0, so its Dexterity modifi er is considered to be –5. A helpless defender is subject to attacks, such as sneak attacks, that rely on a defender being denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Coup de Grace As a full-round action that provokes at- tacks of opportunity, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a help- less defender. You can instead use a bow or crossbow, provided you’re adjacent to the target. You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, it must suc- ceed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Precision damage (see page 42) applies to a coup de grace when all other conditions for that damage are also met. You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to extra damage from critical hits, such as a golem. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature that has total concealment, but doing this re- quires two consecutive full-round actions—one to fi nd the crea- ture once you’ve determined what square it’s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace. SHARING SPACES You can freely enter a square that con- tains a helpless creature, unless the DM rules otherwise, sharing that creature’s space. If you’re in a space with a helpless Small or larger creature that ceases being help- less, and for whatever reason that creature can’t share spaces with you, the creature must be or remain prone, attempt to grapple you, or leave your space at its fi rst opportunity.

BRIGHT LIGHT In an area of bright light, most creatures can see clearly. A creature can’t hide in an area of bright light unless it is invisible, has concealment, or has cover. SHADOWY ILLUMINATION In an area of shadowy illumination, most creatures can see dimly. Creatures within this area have concealment against those who can see only dimly. DARKNESS In areas of darkness, creatures without senses that can overcome the darkness are effectively blinded. DISTANT LIGHT In open spaces, a light source can be spotted from much farther away than its radius of illumination. An observer who succeeds on a DC 20 Spot check sees the light from a distance as indicated below, and one who fails the Spot check automatically notices the light source at half that range.",

Presupposing you can see, determine line of sight by drawing an imaginary line between your space and the target’s space. If any such line isn’t blocked, then you have line of sight to the target, and if it’s a creature, it has line of sight to you. The line isn’t blocked if it doesn’t intersect or even touch squares that block line of sight. If you have line of sight on a target, you can see to cast a targeted spell on it, shoot it with a bow, and so forth. If you can see a portion of a large creature that occupies more than one square, you can target that creature for a spell or any other attack. If you can’t see the target, such as due to being blinded or the target’s invisibility, you can’t have line of sight to it even if you could draw an unblocked line between your space and the target’s. If line of sight to a target is completely blocked, you can’t cast spells or use other abilities that require line of sight to the target. When line of sight is blocked by something that doesn’t otherwise physically block or prevent an attack that doesn’t require line of sight (such as fog), you can still make that attack, but your target is treated as if it were invisible (see page 76). If line of sight is partially blocked, such as by the corner of a building, attacks work normally, but the target’s AC increases due to the cover. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET Three rules that can easily save your character’s life go hand- exciting moments of play if you’re not prepared.

Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic De- vice allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you’re trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll re- quires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability score. If you don’t have a suffi cient score in that ability, you must em- ulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check. Using a scroll still has a mishap chance as normal. This use of the skill also applies to other spell comple- tion magic items. Use Wand Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill al- lows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. Using the skill in this way also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.

Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. 115 SENSES Size The nine size categories, in order from smallest to largest, are Fine, Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gar- gantuan, and Colossal. A creature’s size provides a modifi er to its Armor Class and attack bonus, on grapple checks, on Hide checks, and a modifi er to break open doors. Size also determines how much space a creature takes up and how far it can reach, as well as how much a creature can carry. SIZE AND COMBAT Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position in combat. LITTLE CREATURES Tiny, Diminutive, and Finecreatures take up less than 1 square of space apiece. Twenty-fi ve Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine crea- tures can fi t into a single 5-foot square. A Tiny creature occupies a space 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fi t into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. Doing this provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they don’t threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can’t fl ank an enemy. A creature that A creature that has more than 5 feet of natural reach has a reach of 0 feet still threatens the square it’s in. threatens squares adjacent to it and all others within its reach.

Most splash weapons consist of liquids, such as acid or holy water, in breakable vials. MAKING A THROW To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no weapon profi ciency, so you never take a –4 nonprofi ciency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of that target. You can instead target a specifi c grid in- tersection, unless that intersection is part of a Large or larger creature’s space— in that case, you’re aiming at the creature. If you can aim at the chosen grid intersection, make a ranged attack against AC 5. Crea- tures in all squares adjacent to the grid intersection are dealt the splash damage if you hit. Direct hit damage isn’t dealt to any creature. MISSING THE TARGET If you miss the target, roll 1d8 and consult the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram. This determines the misdirec- tion of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you (a short throw) and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the number of range increments of the throw. (The range increment of a thrown weapon is 5 feet.) After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet. Direct hit damage isn’t dealt to any creature. 143 Illus. by W.

When resolving a turning attempt, add the turn resistance bonus to the creature’s Hit Dice. REBUKING Some creatures can rebuke or command other creatures rather than turning or destroying them. Rebuking requires a turning check as normal for turning, but the results are different. REBUKING RESULTS Creatures that would be turned are rebuked instead, and those that would be destroyed are commanded. Rebuked A rebuked creature cowers for 10 rounds, as if in awe. Commanded A commanded creature is under the mental control of the rebuking creature. The controller must take a standard action to give mental orders to a commanded creature. At any one time, the controller can command any number of creatures whose combined Hit Dice don’t exceed his level. The controller can voluntarily relinquish power over any commanded creatures to command new ones. Otherwise, the commanded state is permanent. DISPELLING TURNING If you can rebuke a target, you can use a daily turning at- tempt to dispel another character’s turning effect on that target. To do so, make a turning check. If your turning check result is equal to or greater than the turning check result that the other character achieved when turning the target or targets, then those targets might no longer be turned. Roll turning damage to see how many Hit Dice worth of targets can be affected in this way. BOLSTERING If you can rebuke a target, you can bolster such targets against turning by making a turning check. The Hit Dice result on the Turning table becomes the targets’ effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned, provided the result is higher than their actual Hit Dice. The bolstering lasts for 10 rounds. If you can rebuke a target of the same type as you, you can bolster yourself in this way. 147 TURNING pqqqqqqqqqrs REBUKING IS COOL If we ever needed proof that evil is cooler than good, this is it. Good clerics smite undead and destroy them. Evil ones compel them into service. Years ago at a convention game, I played in a scenario that came with premade characters. I had the luck to play an evil half-orc cleric who had an eye on betraying the party. Maybe I had a little too much fun “turning” a mob of undead and commanding them to attack the rest of the party. —Mike Mearls, developer pqqqqqqqqqrs Illus. by R. Guay Two-Weapon Fighting If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack with that weapon when you make a full attack. Fighting in this way is very diffi cult, however, and you take a –6 penalty on your attack rolls with your primary hand and a –10 penalty on attack rolls with your off hand. You can reduce these penalties in two ways. • If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always con- sidered light, as is an off-hand attack with a double weapon. • The Two-Weapon Fighting feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6. The table below summarizes the interaction of all these factors. RANGED WEAPONS The same rules apply when you throw or fi re a weapon from each hand, as long as the weapon you’re us- ing doesn’t require two hands to fi re. Treat Medium weapons that weigh 1 pound or less as light when used in this manner. Treat Medi- um weapons that are heavier as one-handed for this purpose. The same light or one-handed des- ignation applies to such weapons when they’re appropriately sized for creatures larger or smaller than Medium. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs MIN-MAX TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING Many methods can maximize the benefits you get from fighting and taking the Improved Critical feat.

CHARACTER CLASSES IN THE WASTE Due to the unique nature of the waste environment, many of the character classes from the Player’s Handbook have additional options open to them. This section presents options for, or variants on, most of the standard eleven classes. Characters who take the elective variant version of the barbarian, druid, and ranger give up some of the fea- tures of their standard class in exchange for others more suited to the wastes. BARBARIAN Barbarians are common in the waste, where survival often comes down to having a few basic skills and the ability to outrun or outfi ght predators. In very few waste locales is any kind of law enforced—aside from tribal codes and customs—so barbarians are perfectly at home. This vari- ant barbarian gains all the class features of the standard barbarian, except as noted below. Wastelands Trap Sense (Su): At 3rd level, a waste barbarian adds the bonus from his trap sense class fea- ture to Reflex saves made against natural hazards of the wastes, as well as to his Armor Class against attacks made by natural hazards. Hazards of the wastes include dangers such as lava pools, slipsand, softsand, and oth- er terrain features (see Chapter 1). This ability replaces the benefits a standard barbarian receives from having trap sense. xoC .E yb .sullI Wasteland barbarians are perfectly at home in the waste 662200__1177773399__CChhpp22..iinndddd 4444 11//77//0055 33::2200::1111 PPMM 45 AND FEATS RACES, CLASSES CHAPTER 2 of the wastes.

A loose fellowship of walkers, called the Dusty Conclave, occasionally gathers to discuss mutual threats and plan action for the coming years. You sometimes work with desert-dwelling tribes and groups of druids, rangers, or barbarians to repel those who would threaten your waste and destroy the creation you have labored so hard to craft.

Entry Hall (EL 11): This long hall is decorated with throne. In Ten-Ap’s case, his spirit was so angered at his trophies from Ten-Ap’s conquests: exotic weapons, shields, betrayal and murder that he readily agreed to the throne’s suits of armor from around the world, and various parts terms—little guessing that his future would forever be tied (heads, horns, skulls, and so on) of a number of rare and completely to the throne. Ten-Ap cannot venture more dangerous beasts. After his death, Ten-Ap’s followers had than 100 feet from the Dead Throne or he turns to lifeless the weapons, shields, and armor plated with gold. Assume dust, along with all of his undead creations. This restriction prevents Ten-Ap from leaving Harrax and conquering the world around him. Even though he and the throne could both be borne on the shoulders of his servants, he recognizes that the throne itself is just made of wood, despite its imposing appearance. A well-placed spell, or even a blow of suffi cient strength, could destroy the throne, end his existence, and wipe away his army in the space of seconds. So Ten-Ap sits and plots, seeking a solution before he sets forth to reconquer his lands. Spells to protect the Dead Throne appear to diminish its power, while surrounding the throne with suffi cient conventional defenses would require almost a mobile castle and eat up too many of his resources. Until Ten-Ap can devise a plan to protect the Dead Throne, he remains where he is, slowly building up his forces in hopes that, one day, he will have enough troops to carry the Dead Throne across the land. A. Courtyard (EL 15): Like many other sections of the city under the sands, Ten-Ap has had a roof built over his courtyard, and he has even gone so far as to decorate it with paintings of the desert sky and the long-fallen spires and towers of his city. Unfortunately, most of the detail is lost in the gloom of the ceiling and centuries of torch soot. The courtyard is guarded by a number of mummy patrols. They stand watch at the main gate, the entrance to the stables, the entrance to the house itself, and the alleyway that leads to the barracks, offices, servants’ quarters, and the royal treasury.
