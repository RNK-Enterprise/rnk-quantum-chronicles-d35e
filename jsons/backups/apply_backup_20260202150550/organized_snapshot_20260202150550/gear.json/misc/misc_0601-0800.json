If your class spell list doesn’t normally include spells of the (adjusted) level of the power word spell, you can’t add it to your spell list. For example, a 5th-level bard/3rd-level dracolexi could select power word distract (see page 115). It is normally a 4th-level spell, but he can treat it as a 3rd- level bard spell. He could even choose power word blind (normally a 7th-level spell) and add it to his class spell list as a 6th-level bard spell, despite the fact that he is not yet capable of casting 6th-level bard spells. He couldn’t choose power word kill or power word stun with this ability, since even with the adjustment these would be 8th-level and 7th-level spells, respectively, which aren’t normally available to bards. Furthermore, if you are (or become) capable of casting spells of that level, you can also add the power word spell to your list of spells known. If you already know the selected power word spell, you can move that spell to one level lower on your class spell list and also add any spell of the power word spell’s original level to your spell list.
