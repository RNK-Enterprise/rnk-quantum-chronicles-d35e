Nelson 8 RETPAHC WEN SRETSNOM Cildabrins are subterranean hunters that prefer temperate or Cildabrin warm underground regions. Incapable of spinning normal webs, cildabrins roam their territory like great wolves, look- ing for any prey they can catch and tear to shreds with their powerful pincers. Once they catch their food, it is poisoned into submission or killed. The cildabrin then retreats to its lair—a warm, dark cave—to eat at its leisure. It devours its prey like a scorpion rather than a spider; its pincers tear off shreds of fl esh small enough for the creature to chew with its mandibles. A cildabrin has no interest in any gear or valuables its prey carries, beyond the possibility that scattering such items around its territory might attract more prey. Sages speculate that cildabrins might be a created race, not one that evolved naturally. Those who espouse this theory point to the aberration’s remarkable similarities to two other natural kinds of arachnid creatures: hunting spiders (such as tarantulas) and scorpi- ons. Cildabrins seem incapable of true speech but can communicate with other arachnids. They are sentient; they merely lack the means to vocalize sounds. When roaming underground, cildabrins sometimes stray perilously close to dungeons, sewers, crypts, and other subterranean elements of civilization. Despite legends to the contrary, it does not seem that cildabrins are tools of the drow. The dark elves fear these terrible beasts at least as much as other humanoids do. In fact, some religious sects among the drow consider the appearance of a cildabrin to be a dire omen.

When they reach the Lower Planes, the conflict begins in earnest, with the inhabi- tants attacking the invaders from Regulus every step of the way. When the much-reduced force returns to Mechanus, the few remaining troops march straight to their superiors to report. What they say in this meeting is the subject of much speculation: Some claim that they report on the progress of the modron invasion; others insist that they merely describe the state of the planes. Granted, this seems a difficult way to gather knowledge, but perhaps the modron mind sees some particular logic about it. Whatever the case, the report is inexplicable to everyone except modrons. Over the centuries, the inhabitants of the other planes have grown accustomed to the March. Previous Marches are well documented, and an adventurous few have roughed out some of the probable routes for upcoming ones. 5 THE MODRON Anyone who watches the Orrery tick and whir for at least 1 hour can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check CATHEDRAL (DC 30) to discover that the device is actually a working Deep in the heart of Regulus, there stands a tower model of the planes, incredibly detailed and infinitely that appears to defy all the laws of mechanics.

Dolphins are extremely numerous in the seas of this plane and the land is awash with rabbits. These seem to be a symbolic representation of the plane itself and exist in all sizes and varieties. Those who dwell upon the plane consider them a lucky animal. Movement on the Plane of Lust The plane of lust is infinite in size, but the further you travel from your starting point the kinkier and more depraved the landscape and inhabitants become. Between this effect and the constantly changing terrain, the plane can be an extremely confusing place to travel in. The only constant landmark is polyamora, whose great turreted spires and suggestive towers can almost always be seen on the horizon and appear to represent a centre point for the plane as a whole. 27 THE PLANE OF LUST replete with nymphs, dryads, satyrs, centaurs and The rain when it falls is light and warm, just enough other traditional woodland creatures. to make clothes and hair cling to the body in interesting ways, for those who still wear clothes Every tree hangs with its branches low, heavy with anyway.

Pink marble-paved streets wind up and down in a gentle undulation between houses and towers of flesh tone rock. Fountains spray here and there, creating cool spots to rest from the balmy atmosphere of the plane. The squares are filled with markets selling all manner of sexual equipment, books, spells and services. Some from the further reaches of the plane travel here to entice others who share their kinks back with them and others serve in the brothels, which are more common than the taverns and do not charge. With no need for food or drink save for pleasure, the shops that sell such fare all sell luxuries often traded for sexual favours rather than money. The confections are wonders, near magical in their creation and unmatched anywhere else on the planes. Some offer services to prepare their patrons like confectionery and then have it nibbled off them piece by piece. Those places that offer drinks offer exotic cocktails, sweet liqueurs and finely aged spirits. Clothiers sell only the most flattering of outfits cut from the most diaphanous of silks.
