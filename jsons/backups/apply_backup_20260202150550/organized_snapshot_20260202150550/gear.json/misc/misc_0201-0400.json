Fashioned by the greatest elven artists of the modern age, no two thespian\u0027s masks are alike. A thespian\u0027s mask is carved from the finest ivory and then painted to resemble the face of a humanoid creature. Depending on the whim of the artisan creating it, a thespian\u0027s mask might, for example, bear a fearsome orc warrior\u0027s visage, the fair skin of an elven maiden, or the face of an old human sage. When worn, the mask merges with its owner\u0027s face, changing his features to match those of the humanoid creature depicted upon it. The change affects the wearer as the spell disguise self, but it only changes the wearer\u0027s appearance to match that of the face the mask was crafted to depict. For example, a thespian mask in the form of a fair-skinned elven maiden would disguise its wearer—including clothing and equipment—as an elven maiden and nothing else.

If you did, the characters might find nothing but empty potion bottles and scroll tubes after defeating the encounter. NPCs with Treasure The gear that NPCs carry serves as the bulk of their treasure. The average value of an NPC’s gear is listed on Table 4–23: NPC Gear Value, and examples of what specific gear a character of a given class and level would have are in the sample NPC descriptions in Chapter 4. NPCs may have treasure in addition to their gear, at your discretion, but an NPC’s gear is already worth about three times the average value of a treasure of his or her level. Defeating NPC foes brings about great reward for treasure-seekers, but since the gear is mostly magic that the NPC can use against the charac- ters (some of which is one-use), it all evens out. Other Treasure At times you’re going to want to generate a treasure on the fly that’s not directly related to a monster. You might, for example, have created a devious dungeon full of traps and puzzles with no monsters at all, and now you have to generate the “grand treasure” that the traps were protecting. You can still use the table. First find the average party level, then use the table in the Treasure Values sidebar (page 54) to figure out the wealth the PCs should gain in the course of the adventure. Subtract the total value of all the other treasure in the adventure. What’s left is the value of the grand trea- sure. You can generate the contents randomly by finding the aver- age treasure value on Table 3–3: Treasure Values per Encounter that most closely matches it. That tells you the level of the grand treasure, and you can use that to roll on Table 3–5: Treasure for coins, goods, and items. Using the Treasure Table Cross-reference the level of the treasure on the left with the type of treasure. The level of the treasure is equal to the CR of the monsters in the encounter.

        "description":  "The remorhazes usually rest about 10 feet under the surface, with one on either side of the crevasse. By design or by chance, the two creatures\u0027 tremorsense abilities cover the whole length of the crevasse. When one remorhaz notes prey nearby, it burrows up to attack with surprise while its mate moves into the crevasse, then burrows up to attack as well. It takes the mate 2-3 rounds to join the fight. If either remorhaz swallows someone whole, it immediately retreats under the snow, which collapses to fill the tunnel the creature has left behind. Fortunately, the blockage is fairly easy to clear. A Small or larger character can clear it away with a full-round action, revealing a slippery tunnel about 8 feet wide. A single Tiny or smaller creature needs an extra full-round action to clear the blockage for every size category below Small. Two or more creatures who cooperate to clear blockage are treated as a single creature of the next size category larger. For example, two Tiny creatures working together can clear the blockage with one full-round action. Movement inside the tunnel is hampered for creatures that do not have burrowing speeds. Ice Caves (EL 12) Several, long, rambling ice caves riddle the glacier\u0027s lower end. The interconnected caves create almost a mile of twisting corridors and chambers. Some of the passageways lead to crevasses higher up in the glacier. The caves have slippery floors that hamper movement and ceilings between 5 and 12 feet high. Walls inside the caves have a Climb DC of 18. Anytime except winter, pools of meltwater form in the cave, then freeze again into crystal clear ice. Many of these pools have only a thin crust of ice, with 1 or 2 feet of freezing water beneath. The crust can support only 20 pounds. A character approaching a pool at normal pace is entitled to a DC 15 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in. If someone runs or charges in the caves (difficult because of the hampered movement), the character doesn\u0027t have a chance to detect the pool before stepping in. The freezing water in the pool deals 1d3 points of temporary cold damage. The water also soaks the character\u0027s footgear, and a character with wet feet takes a -4 penalty on all checks and saves to resist the effects of environmental cold, such as the hourly save a character must make to avoid the effects of cold or severe cold on the glacier. Throughout the caves, visitors find sculpted walls, floors, and ice columns of almost unearthly beauty. Here and there, floors and walls made of otherwise clear ice have fantastical patterns of frost traced across them. The patterns have their own eerie beauty. To the untrained eye, these features seem like an unusual natural phenomenon, but a DC 15 Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (dungeoneering), or Appraise check reveals them to be artificial.",
