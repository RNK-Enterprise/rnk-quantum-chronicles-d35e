From itsposition inside the egg, the wyrmling cannot bite the eggshell,and the wyrmling’s claws are too weak to overcome the shell’s hardness. To escape the egg, the wyrmling must break the shell by making a DC 20 Strength check. Fortunately for the wyrmling, it can simply take 20 on the check, breaking theshell in about 2 minutes. To determine the day on which the eggs in a clutch hatch, roll 1d10. On an odd number, the eggs hatch 1d10 days earlierthan the norm (see Table 1–1). On an even number, the eggshatch 1d10 days later than the norm. If the egg has been tended by at least one of the wyrmling’s parents, it needs to make no further checks to survive. If incubation conditions have been less than ideal, however, the wyrmling must make a Constitution check to survive. The table below provides a list of circumstances and the DC of theConstitution check to survive despite the bad conditions. In the case of a disturbed nest or an egg removed from a nest, the creature tending the egg may make a Heal check, witha +1 bonus if the creature has 5 or more ranks of Knowledge(arcana). The wyrmling can use either its own Constitution check result or the Heal check result, whichever is higher. Opening an egg before the final quarter of the incubation period causes the wyrmling inside to die. If the egg is opened during the final quarter of the incubation period, the wyrm- ling can make a check to survive, but if successful it takesnonlethal damage equal to its current hit points. This damage cannot be healed until the wyrmling’s normal incubation period passes, and the wyrmling remains staggered for the entireperiod. During this period, a prematurely hatched wyrmling must be tended in the same manner as an unhatched egg in order to survive.

All the eggs in a clutch hatch at about the same time. Properly tended and incubated dragon eggs have practi- cally a 100% hatching rate. Eggs that have been disturbed,and particularly eggs that have been removed from a nestand incubated artificially, may be much less likely to pro-duce live wyrmlings. WYRMLING (AGE 0-5 YEARS) A wyrmling emerges from its egg fully formed and ready toface life. From the tip of its nose to the end of itstail, it is about twice as long as the egg that heldit (the actual size of the wyrmling depends onthe variety of dragon; see Chapter 5). A newly hatched dragon emerges from its egg cramped and sodden. Afterabout an hour, it is ready to fly,fight, and reason. It inheritsa considerable body of prac-tical knowledge from itsparents, though such inher-ent knowledge often liesburied in the wyrmling’smemory, unnoticed andunused until it is needed. Compared to older drag- ons, a wyrmling seems a littleawkward. Its head and feet seemslightly oversized, and its wings and tail areproportionately smaller than they are in adults. If a parent is present at the wyrmling’s hatching, the youngster has a protector and will probably enjoy a secureexistence for the first decades of its life. If not, the wyrmlingfaces a struggle for survival. Whether raised by another dragon or left to fend for itself, the wyrmling’s first order of business is learning to be adragon, which includes securing food, finding a lair, andunderstanding its own abilities (usually in that order). A newly hatched wyrmling almost immediately searches for food. The first meal for a wyrmling left to fend for itself isoften the shell from its egg. This practice not only assures theyoungster a good dose of vital minerals, but also provides analternative to attacking and consuming its nestmates. Wyrm-lings reared by parents are often offered some tidbit that thevariety favors. For example, copper dragons provide theiroffspring with monstrous centipedes or scorpions. In manycases this meal is in the form of living prey, and the wyrmlinggets its first hunting lesson along with its first meal. With its hunger satisfied, the wyrmling’s next task is se- curing a lair. The dragon looks for some hidden anddefensible cave, nook, or cranny where it can rest, hide, and begin storing treasure. Even a wyrmling under the care of a parent finds a section of the parent’s lair to call its own. Once it feels secure in its lair and reason- ably sure of its food supply, the wyrmling settles down to hone its inherent abilities. It usually does so by testing itself in any way it can. It tussles with its nestmates, seeks out dangerous creatures to fight, and spends long hours in meditation. If a parent is present, the wyrmling receives instruction on draconic matters and the chance to accompany the parent during its daily activities. Wyrm- lings on th eir own sometimes seek out older dragons of the same kind as mentors. Among good dragons, such relationships tend to be casual and often last for decades (a fairly short period by dragon standards). The young- ster visits the older dragon periodically (monthly, perhaps weekly) for advice and informa- tion. Evil dragons, too, often counsel wyrmlings that are not their offspring—evil dragons lack any sense of altruism, but usually understand the role of youth in perpetuating the species. No matter what kinds of dragons are involved, such mentor-apprentice relationships require the younger dragon to show the utmost respect and deferenceto the older dragon, and to bring the mentor gifts of food,information, and treasure. Should the older dragon evercome to view the apprentice as a rival, the relationship endsimmediately; when evil dragons are involved, the ending isoften fatal for the younger dragon. VERY YOUNG (AGE 6-15 YEARS) By age 6, a dragon has grown enough to double its length,though its head and feet still seem too big for the rest of itsbody . It becomes physically stronger and more robust. Thedragon’s larger size often makes finding a new lair necessary .Many dragons relocate at this stage anyway, especially ifthey do not have parental support. (After the dragon hashunted in an area for five years, the location of the originallair might have become known to outsiders, or the areaaround the lair could become depleted of prey .) In most ways, a very young dragon remains much like a wyrmling, albeit more confident in itself.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS ONSET OF THE TWILIGHT AND DEATH A dragon’s maximum age is a function of its Charisma score. For a chromatic dragon, multiply the dragon’s Charisma scoreby 50 and add the result to 1,200. This is the age when the twilight period begins for that kind of dragon. For a metallic dragon, multiply the dragon’s Charisma score by 100 and addthe result to 1,200. This difference reflects the fact that metal-lic dragons are longer-lived than chromatic dragons. Maximum ages for the dragons found in the Monster Manual are given on the table below.When a dragon’s twilight period begins, the dragon must make a DC 20 Constitution check. The dragon dies if the check fails.If the check succeeds, the dragon survives, but its Constitutionscore drops by 1. Each year thereafter, the dragon must succeed on another Constitution check in order to stay alive. pqqqqrspqqqqrs Color Years to Twilight Black 2,200 Blue 2,300Green 2,300 Red 2,500White 2,100Color Years to TwilightBrass 3,200 Bronze 3,800Copper 3,400 Gold 4,400Silver 4,200Guillaume and Cirjon established that the shortest-lived true dragon, the white, can live as long as 2,100 years. Thetrue dragon species that lives the longest is the gold; Guil-laume and Cirjon put the gold’s maximum age at 4,400 years. In addition, the sages discovered that dragons can extend their life spans to some extent by entering a state called “thetwilight.” That term, coined by Guillaume and Cirjon, refersto the closing phase of a dragon’s life. The cessation of growthat the great wyrm stage heralds the onset of death (as it doesfor most creatures that grow throughout their lives). A dragoncan survive for centuries after reaching the great wyrm stage,but a dragon is mortal and cannot stave off death forever. Thetwilight occurs when the weight of a dragon’s years finallycomes crashing down, forcing the dragon’s physiology intoa downward spiral. A dragon’s twilight period can last for anumber of years, but often the dragon succumbs when the twilight first sets in. AVOIDING THE TWILIGHT Many dragons prefer to avoid a slow descent into deathand leave the mortal coil with their dignity intact. Manygreat wyrms seem to just disappear at the ends of their lives.No one knows exactly where they go, but scholars haveidentified at least three possibilities: departure, guardian-ship, and dracolichdom. Departure A dragon can simply will its spirit to depart. Upon doing so,the dragon dies, and its spirit is released into the hereafter.A dragon prepares for its departure by consuming its entire 15CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS When flying and making an attack action, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that thetotal distance moved is not greater than your fly speed. Yourflying movement does not provoke attacks of opportunityfrom the creatures you attack during the round when youuse this feat. AWAKEN FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE [MONSTROUS] You gain frightful presence. You gain the frightful presence special ability with a radius in feet equal to 5 ×1/2 your racial Hit Dice. The ability takes effect automatically whenever you attack, charge, or fly overhead. Creatures within the radius aresubject to the effect if they can see you and have fewer Hit Dice than your racial Hit Dice. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your racial HD + your Cha modifier)remains immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice becomepanicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more Hit Dicebecome shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the fright-ful presence of other dragons. As the Snatch feat (see page 304 of the Monster Manual ), except that you can grab a creature two size cate- gories smaller than you with your bite or claw attack. IMPROVED SPEED [MONSTROUS] You are faster than others of your kind. When flying, you can dive and land on an opponent to deal extra damage. This is a standard action that can only affect creatures that are smaller than you. You make an overrun attack, but the opponent cannot choose to avoid you. If you knock down the target, you may make an additional slam attack, dealing the indicated dam- age plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus (round down). This at- tack is at the usual +4bonus against proneopponents.CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONSIllus. by B.

Make a bull rush attack by rolling once regardless of how many creatures are in theradius. Every creature in the radius makes a Strength checkand compares it to your roll. Those who fail their opposedchecks are knocked down. Structures and unattended objects at least par- tially within the shock wave take damage equal to 1d6 +your Strength bonus. SNATCH AND SWALLOW [MONSTROUS] You can swallow creatures you have grabbed with yourbite attack. A creature vulnerable to an element or energy type takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal fromthat energy type. TAIL CONSTRICT [MONSTROUS] You can make constriction attacks with your tail. You can grab and constrict creatures you hit with your tail slap attack. This works just like a snatch attack, exceptthat it can be used against any creature smaller than you. If you successfully grab an opponent with your tail, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your tail slap damageplus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. Each round youhold your opponent, you deal constriction damage. You cannot make tail slap or tail sweep attacks while con- stricting an opponent with your tail. TAIL SWEEP KNOCKDOWN [MONSTROUS] Your tail sweep attack knocks opponents prone. As a full-round action, you can hover in place and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder witha radius and height of 10 feet times your age category . The wind blows from the center of your body toward the outside edge at the bottom of the cylinder. The force of the wind depends on your size, as indicated below. For the effects of high winds, see Table 3–24 on page95 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Dragon Size Wind Force Large Severe Huge WindstormGargantuan Hurricane Colossal Tornado Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in whichcase they are blown back 1d6 ×5 feet).

Thesebonus skill points are in addition to the skill points gainedat every level, and are not modified by the dragon’s Intelli-gence score. A creature with the improved grab ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity when beginning agrapple. CUNNING SIDESTEP [GENERAL] You have a better than normal chance to avoid being bullrushed or tripped. You gain the use of the frightful presence ability . Whenever you attack or charge, all opponents within aradius of 30 feet who have fewer levels or Hit Dice than youbecome shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + yourCha modifier. The effect is negated by a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). A successful save indicates that the opponent is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. This ability can’taffect creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, nor doesit have any effect on dragons.

This is a mind- affecting ability . Song of Compul- sion: At 2nd level, a dragonsong lyrist can use her greater dragon- song to make a sugges- tion to a single creature within 30 feet who can hear the lyrist. A Will save negates the effect. This is an enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. Dragons take a –2 penalty on this saving throw. At 4th level, a dragonsong lyrist can use her song or poetics to inspire fear in her foes. All enemieswithin a radius of 30 feet ×class level are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragonsong lyrist.

This is a mind-affecting effect. In many cases when a dragon joins a party, it does so as a wyrmling or at a youthful age. But just because awyrmling dragon has a decent Intelligence and more hitpoints than the average ogre doesn’t make it adult in its out-look. Dragons mature slowly, meaning that even a 30-year-old juvenile dragon acts more like a child than an adult.This may mean that a youthful dragon doesn’t always followinstructions well, and may even completely disobey the PCwho “controls” it. The DM should feel comfortable in occasionally having a juvenile or younger dragon “act up” in a manner appropriateto its alignment. A good dragon may simply sulk or pout,while an evil dragon might lash out at those upsetting it.Chaotic dragons are prone to tantrums in their youth, whilelawful dragons are more likely to misbehave in a carefullyplotted manner. DRAGONS AS MOUNTS The dream mount for many characters is a dragon. Whileother flying creatures might be cheaper or easier to train asmounts, nothing beats the look of awe from friends and foeswhen they see you swoop in astride a mighty draconic steed. raising the dragon from youth or negotiating with a full-grown dragon. The first may be easier and cheaper, butrequires far more time. Each method is discussed later inthis section As strong, quadrupedal creatures, dragons can carry a lot of weight, even in flight. A dragon can carry a rider whileswimming, but not while burrowing. Table 3–13: Dragon Mounts, Overland Movement, and Carrying Capacity provides movement rates and carryingcapacity for a great number of different dragons. The columnheaders on the table are defined below. The left-hand column lists a number of dragons that are suitable for use as mounts. The mounts are groupedaccording to the largest size of rider each dragon can accom-modate. Just because a dragon can carry your weight doesn’tnecessarily mean that you can ride it as a mount. Even if adragon is strong enough to carry a larger character than itsgrouping on the table would indicate, it can’t accommodatesuch a character as a rider.CHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVE137CHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVETable 3–13: Dragon Mounts, Overland Movement, and Carrying Capacity —— Light Load or No Load —— —— Medium or Heavy Load —— Dragon Miles per Hour Miles per Day Load Range Miles per Hour Miles per Day Diminutive or Smaller RidersPseudodragon 1.5, fly 6 12, fly 48 29–86 lb. 1 8 Tiny or Smaller RidersBlack, very young 6, fly 20, swim 6 48, fly 160, swim 48 51–150 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 White, very young 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 51–150 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Brass, very young 6, fly 30 48, fly 240 51–150 lb. 4 32 Copper, very young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 51–150 lb. 3 24 Small or Smaller Riders Black, young 6, fly 20, swim 6 48, fly 160, swim 48 101–300 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 Black, juvenile 6, fly 20, swim 6 48, fly 160, swim 48 131–390 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Blue, very young 4, fly 15 32, fly 120 101–300 lb. 3 24 Blue, young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 131–390 lb. 3 24Brass, young 6, fly 30 48, fly 240 101–300 lb. 4 32 Brass, juvenile 6, fly 30 48, fly 240 131–390 lb. 4 32Bronze, very young 4, fly 15, swim 6 32, fly 120, swim 48 101–300 lb. 3, swim 4 24, swim 32 Bronze, young 4, fly 20, swim 6 32, fly 160, swim 48 131–390 lb. 3, swim 4 24, swim 32Copper, young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 101–300 lb. 3 24 Copper, juvenile 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 131–390 lb. 3 24Green, very young 4, fly 15, swim 4 32, fly 120, swim 32 101–300 lb. 3, swim 3 24, swim 24 Green, young 4, fly 20, swim 4 32, fly 160, swim 32 131–390 lb. 3, swim 3 24, swim 24Silver, very young 4, fly 15 32, fly 120 101–300 lb. 3 24 Silver, young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 131–390 lb. 3 24White, young 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 101–300 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32White, juvenile 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 131–390 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 Medium or Smaller RidersBlack, young adult 6, fly 20, swim 6 48, fly 160, swim 48 351–1,050 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 Black, adult 6, fly 20, swim 6 48, fly 160, swim 48 461–1,380 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Blue, juvenile 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 176–525 lb. 3 24 Blue, young adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 601–1,800 lb. 3 24Brass, young adult 6, fly 30 48, fly 240 351–1,050 lb. 4 32 Brass, adult 6, fly 30 48, fly 240 601–1,800 lb. 4 32Bronze, juvenile 4, fly 20, swim 6 32, fly 160, swim 48 351–1,050 lb. 3, swim 4 24, swim 32 Bronze, young adult 4, fly 20, swim 6 32, fly 160, swim 48 601–1,800 lb. 3, swim 4 24, swim 32Copper, young adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 351–1,050 lb. 3 24 Copper, adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 601–1,800 lb. 3 24Dragonnel 4, fly 9 32, fly 72 351–1,050 lb. 3 24 Gold, very young 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 461–1,380 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Gold, young 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 801–2,400 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 Gold, juvenile 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 1,401–4,200 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Green, juvenile 4, fly 20, swim 4 32, fly 160, swim 32 351–1,050 lb. 3, swim 3 24, swim 24 Green, young adult 4, fly 20, swim 4 32, fly 160, swim 32 601–1,800 lb. 3, swim 3 24, swim 24Red, very young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 461–1,380 lb. 3 24 Red, young 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 801–2,400 lb. 3 24Red, juvenile 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 1,401–4,200 lb. 3 24 Silver, juvenile 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 351–1,050 lb. 3 24Silver, young adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 601–1,800 lb. 3 24 White, young adult 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 351–1,050 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Wyvern 2, fly 6 16, fly 48 233–700 lb. 1.5 12 Large or Smaller RidersBlue, adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 2,081–6,240 lb. 3 24 Bronze, adult 4, fly 20, swim 6 32, fly 160, swim 48 2,081–6,240 lb. 3, swim 4 24, swim 32Dragon turtle 2, swim 3 16, swim 24 2,081–6,240 lb. 1.5, swim 2 12, swim 16 Gold, young adult 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 3,681–11,040 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32Gold, adult 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 4,161–12,480 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32 Green, adult 4, fly 20, swim 4 32, fly 160, swim 32 2,081–6,240 lb. 3, swim 3 24, swim 24Red, young adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 3,681–11,040 lb. 3 24 Red, adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 4,161–12,480 lb. 3 24Silver, adult 4, fly 20 32, fly 160 2,081–6,240 lb. 3 24White, adult 6, fly 30, swim 6 48, fly 240, swim 48 601–1,800 lb. 4, swim 4 32, swim 32138Light Load or No Load: Dragons, like other flying creatures, can only fly when carrying no more than a light load.

Though rela- tively simpleminded for dragons, they are fiercely loyal to their masters. A dragonnel stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder andmeasures nearly 10 feet fromnose to tail. Its scales range from red-brown to a brilliant gold. A pair of muscled wings sprouts from its shoulders, spanningup to 30 feet in flight. In the wild, dragonnels typically lair in hidden caves located far from civilization. Occasionally, a group of up 151CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS Dragonkin152to four families settles in nearby locations, sharing hunting and protection duties among the various adults. Dragonnels speak Draconic. COMBAT A dragonnel opens combat with its roar, hoping to frightenwould-be opponents. Once engaged in battle, it fights fear-lessly, using its claws and bite to shred its enemies. Roar (Ex): Once per day, a dragonnel can unleash a mighty roar. All enemies within a 30-foot-radius spread who canhear the dragonnel must succeed on a DC 14 Will save orbecome shaken for 1d6 rounds. Training a Dragonnel Although intelligent, a dragonnel requires training beforeit can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a dragonnelmust have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this canbe achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).Training a friendly dragonnel re-quires six weeks of work and asuccessful Handle Animal check(DC 30 for a young creature, or DC 35for a mature creature of three or moreyears in age). Dragonnel eggs are worth 5,000gp apiece onthe open market, whileyoung are worth7,500 gp each. Pro-fessional trainerscharge 2,500 gp torear or train a dragonnel.Riding a trained dragonnelrequires an exotic saddle. Adragonnel can fight while carry-ing a rider, but the rider cannotalso attack unless he or she suc-ceeds on a Ride check (see theRide skill, page 80 of thePlayer’s Handbook). Earth drakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *They have an additional +4 racial bonus on Hidechecks when in rocky environments (such as mountain ter-rain or underground). 153CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS154FIRE DRAKE Large Dragon (Fire) Bite +12 melee (2d6+5)CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSFire drake Earth drakeAir drake +3 Ice drakes are vicious scavengers that lair in cold or arctic lands. The scales of an ice drake are ivory in color, with occa- sional tinges of ice-blue. Ice drakes have short, stocky limbsand a wide, flat tail that helps them climb on icy surfaces. Ice drakes give large predators a wide berth, preferring to wait until after such creatures have finished feasting tomove in on the remains. They aren’t afraid to chase off small-er predators such as wolves. An ice drake speaks Draconic and either Auran or Aquan (50% chance of either). The creatures speak halt-ingly, but woe to any who mistake this trait for lack ofintelligence. Combat Unless it is desperate, an ice drake only takes on livingopponents smaller than itself, and preferably from hiding. Itfocuses its attacks on an individual, using its freezing touchto weaken that opponent to the point where it can grappleit and fly away . Freezing Touch (Su): Anyone hit by an ice drake’s claw attack takes an extra 1d6 points of cold damage and mustsucceed on a DC 18 Reflex save or also take 1 point ofStrength damage. +3 The mightiest of the elemental drakes, the magma drake smolders with evil power. The thick, scaled hide of a magma drake resembles cool- ing lava, with obsidian claws and gleaming crimson eyes.Though these creatures appear slow and clumsy, they movewith surprising agility . Magma drakes generally live in deep caves or in volcanic craters, particularly those with nearby lakes or rivers ormolten rock. They often ally with efreet or salamanders. A magma drake speaks Draconic and either Ignan or Terran (50% chance of either). The creatures’ voices rumblewith power, suggestive of their volcanic heritage. Combat A magma drake wastes no time toying with its prey, pre-ferring to pin a grappled target and watch it burn to death.If it has room to fly, it uses Flyby Attack to grapple anopponent and bring it somewhere where it can dispatch itat its leisure. Burn (Ex): Those grappled by a magma drake must suc- ceed on a DC 22 Reflex save or catch fire. The fire burns for1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire, page 303 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame (but not while grappled). Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a magma drake must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack.It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action withoutprovoking an attack of opportunity . Magma drakes have a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks and on Hide checks. 155CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS156OOZE DRAKE Large Dragon (Aquatic, Earth, Water) The creature’s type changesto undead. It gains theincorporeal subtype. Size isunchanged. A ghostly dragon retains all the attacks of the base dragon, although those relying on physical contact donot affect nonethereal creatures. It also gains an incorporealtouch attack, which it can use with any body part normallycapable of attacking (which may include the bite, a claw, awing, or a tail). Apply a ghostly dragon’s Dexterity modifier,not its Strength modifier, to its incorporeal touch attack roll. Against ethereal creatures, a ghostly dragon uses the base dragon’s damage ratings. Against nonetherealcreatures, a ghostly dragon usually cannot deal physical dam-age but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests(see below). Hoard scarabs have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks. Hoard scarabs have a +4 racial bonus on Hidechecks when they are concealed among coins (at least 10coins for an individual scarab, or at least 10,000 coins for aswarm). A hoard scarab has a +8 racial bonus on Climbchecks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,even if rushed or threatened.LANDWYRM Landwyrms are cunning, wingless predatory dragons whoruthlessly scour their environment for prey . While someclaim they represent a primitive, ancestral form of the truedragons, most dismiss such claims. Regardless of its origin,each variety of landwyrm is singularly adapted to its natu-ral environment. All landwyrms lack wings, but their body shapes vary by type, from serpentine (desert landwyrms) to craggy(mountain landwyrms). They have large, powerful jaws,clawed fore and hind limbs, and thick scales whose col-oration matches that of their natural environment. Landwyrms have stores of great knowledge about their environment, and if approached peacefully and respectfully,they can be sources of great wisdom. Landwyrms can make excellent steeds, though they are strong-willed and independent, so even the least intelli-gent must be treated with great respect, or it will turn onits rider. COMBAT Each type of landwyrm has different combat tactics, thoughmost rely on stealth to surprise their opponents. They areskilled trackers, and they see nothing wrong with fleeing abattle only to follow their prey and attack again later. Frightful Presence (Ex): Much like the chromatic and metallic dragons, landwyrms can unsettle their foes withtheir mere presence. This ability takes effect automaticallywhenever the landwyrm attacks or charges. Creatureswithin the specified radius are subject to the effect if theyare at least one size category smaller than the landwyrm andhave fewer HD than the landwyrm. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 landwyrm’s HD + landwyrm’s Cha modifier)CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSHoard Scarab Hoard Scarab Swarm Fine Vermin Fine Vermin (Swarm) ——remains immune to that landwyrm’s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures whose HD are less thanhalf the landwyrm’s HD become panicked for 2d6 roundsand those whose HD are equal to or more than half thelandwyrm’s HD become shaken for 2d6 rounds. Otherdragons (whether landwyrms or not) are immune to a land-wyrm’s frightful presence. DESERT LANDWYRM — The heart of a desert landwyrm burns with a patient evil as it lies in wait for victims. A desert landwyrm’s yellow-brown scales perfectly blend with its arid surroundings. Their sinuous bodiesmake them look like enormous serpents, until one noticesthe powerful front and rear claws normally held tightagainst the body . Desert landwyrms often lair in ancient tombs or other ruined buildings, which leads to their nickname of “tombdragon.” They are quite capable of defending their lairsfrom any but the largest blue dragons, with whom theyoften clash over territory . They respond best when offeredvaluables. Desert landwyrms speak Draconic and Common. 169CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS Illus. by W . EnglandDesert landwyrm Hill landwyrm Forest landwyrm170Combat Thanks to its hardy nature, a desert landwyrm can lie buriedin the sand for weeks at a time waiting for prey, with onlyits rocky eye-ridge protruding. When potential victimsapproach, the landwyrm bursts forth, creating a sandstormto blind its prey . It ignores panicked opponents, knowingthat it can track them down later if needed. Desert Adaptation (Ex): Desert landwyrms can go with- out water for a number of days equal to their Constitutionscore. Even after this point, they need only make a Con-stitution check each day (rather than each hour, as notedin Starvation and Thirst, page 304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ) to avoid taking nonlethal damage from thirst. They take no nonlethal damage from heat exposure (though theytake damage from fire normally). They suffer no ill effectsfrom being caught in dust storms or sandstorms (includingtheir own sandstorm attack; see below). Frightful Presence (Ex): 160-ft. radius, HD 31 or fewer, Will DC 31 negates. Sandstorm (Ex): As a standard action, a desert landwyrm can create a small sandstorm by kicking up sand, dust, anddebris in a 120-foot-radius spread centered on itself. Anycreature in the affected area must succeed on a DC 33 Forti-tude save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. This ability onlyfunctions in deserts or areas with similar quantities of dustor sand. Improved Critical (bite), Improved Initiative, Im- proved Overrun, Multiattack, Power Attack, Stealthy, Track — Hill landwyrms are slow-witted bullies who rely on intimida- tion and displays of physical prowess to subdue their enemies. A hill landwyrm’s coloration varies with its surround- ings. Some are slate-gray, while others have brown, red-brown, or tan scales. They appear bulky and muscular, withlong, daggerlike claws. Despite their might, hill landwyrms prefer to pick on opponents clearly weaker than themselves. While a singlehill giant is a tempting target, a hunting party of giantssends a hill landwyrm into hiding. Some giants capture hilllandwyrms to use as guardians or steeds, though the dragonshate this and escape as soon as possible. It is possible for asuitably intimidating individual to humble a hill landwyrmwithout striking a blow. Hill landwyrms speak Draconic, Goblin, and Common. Combat A hill landwyrm likes to open combat with an overrunattack against the weakest-looking target. Once an oppo-nent is prone, it focuses its attacks on that individual, usingimproved grab to neutralize the target and crush it to death.If reduced to half its hit points or fewer, a hill landwyrmbegins looking for an escape route. Frightful Presence (Ex): 100-ft. radius, HD 19 or fewer, Will DC 21 negates. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a hill landwyrm must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack.It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action withoutprovoking an attack of opportunity . — Among its kind, the jungle landwyrm is considered the most purely sinister and evil. It knows no emotion except hate,which it holds for all other living creatures. A jungle landwyrm’s scaled hide is deep green in color, with occasional splotches of bright red or yellow that blendin with its tropical environment. Despite their size, junglelandwyrms have lithe forms that slide easily through foliageand between trees. Some unwitting individuals mistake thejungle landwyrm for an enormous dinosaur and think theycan treat it as they would a mere animal. Such fools don’t livelong after making this mistake. A jungle landwyrm eats anything it can, though it prefers living prey to carrion or plants. It has few rivals for power,although it avoids older green dragons. Even in rare instanceswhen the landwyrm seems willing to negotiate, it inevitablytricks its prey and attacks it later. Jungle landwyrms speak Draconic and Common. Combat Like others of its kind, a jungle landwyrm relies on its natu-ral camouflage to surprise enemies. However, it is also willingto follow potential prey for great distances, choosing just theright circumstances to strike. If faced with multiple oppo-nents, it spreads out its early attacks and doesn’t hesitate toflee if overmatched, knowing it can return days later to pickoff those weakened by its disease-bearing claws. Disease (Ex): The wounds caused by a jungle landwyrm’s claws may become infected with red ache disease (DC 15;incubation 1d3 days; damage 1d6 Strength). Frightful Presence (Ex): 140-ft. radius, HD 27 or fewer, Will DC 27 negates. Rend (Ex): Extra damage 2d10+15. Snatch (Ex): Against Small or smaller creatures, bite for 2d8+10/round or claw for 2d6+5/round. Jungle Adaptation (Ex): Jungle landwyrms can ignore any concealment provided by foliage. *Jungle landwyrms have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in warm forest (or jungle) environments. Thisbonus on Hide checks increases to +8 when the landwyrmis immobile. 171CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS172MOUNTAIN LANDWYRM Colossal Dragon +2 The plains landwyrm would be a pitiful beast if it weren’t so dangerous. Despite its general cowardice, this scavenger occa-sionally attacks living creatures when it is hungry or desperate. A plains landwyrm has scales that bear stripes of tan or light green, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings. Itis sometimes mistaken for a raptorlike dinosaur, since itoften stands up on its hind legs. Most plains landwyrms wander their environment, since they aren’t courageous enough to fight other creatures forterritory . The creature is capable of bluffing when in a crisis,though it rarely has the patience for such tactics. Some par-ticularly brave halflings tame these creatures as mounts,though it takes an attentive rider to keep them on task. Plains landwyrms speak Draconic and Common. Combat Whether lying in wait in the tall grass or hiding under a thinlayer of earth, a plains landwyrm favors a quick strike againstan unwary foe. Burst of Speed (Ex): Once per day, a plains landwyrm may activate a burst of speed as a free action. This doubles itsCHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSspeed for 5 rounds, after which it is fatigued for 10 min- utes. It usually uses this ability to escape from danger. Frightful Presence (Ex): 40-ft. radius, HD 7 or fewer, Will DC 15 negates. Poison (Ex): The bite of a plains landwyrm delivers a toxic venom (Fort DC 16; 1d6 Str/2d6 Str). Fort +20, Ref +14, Will +15CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS Tundra landwyrm Underdark landwyrmSwamp landwyrmAbilities: Str 27, Dex 10, Con 22, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 12 — The blood-drinking tundra landwyrm spends much of its life in semihibernation, burrowed under the icy ground inwait for prey to happen by . The scales of a tundra landwyrm are dirty ivory . It has short, stubby claws that help it dig through the frozen earth.Its roar sounds like the bark of an angry sea lion. A tundra landwyrm prefers mammalian prey, such as cari- bou or even polar bears. The creatures occasionally tangle withwhite dragons or frost worms. Any offering of live or recentlykilled animals can sway a tundra landwyrm’s opinion. Tundra landwyrms speak Draconic and Common. Combat A tundra landwyrm lies motionless a few feet beneath thesurface of the ground, relying on its tremorsense to warn itof prey . It scatters targets with its frightful presence, thengrapples a single creature and attempts to drain its blood. Blood Drain (Ex): If a tundra landwyrm gets a hold on a living foe, it can drain blood with a successful grapplecheck. Each successful grapple check deals 1d6 points ofConstitution damage to its target. A single landwyrm candeal as many points of Constitution damage in a day as ithas Hit Dice. Frightful Presence (Ex): 120-ft. radius, HD 23 or fewer, Will DC 23 negates. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tundra land- wyrm must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a clawattack. If it gets a hold, it can attempt to draw blood. It canalso attempt to start a grapple as a free action without pro-voking an attack of opportunity . Snatch (Ex): Against Small or smaller creatures, bite for 2d8+8/round or claw for 2d6+4/round. Cold Adaptation (Ex): Tundra landwyrms take no non- lethal damage from exposure to low temperatures (thoughthis ability doesn’t affect normal cold-based damage). Theysuffer no ill effects (such as penalties on Spot checks) fromsnow or sleet and can walk across icy surfaces without need-ing to make a Balance check. The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, orskill points. Size is unchanged. The creature retains its land speed, but loses fly and swim speeds. If it had a burrow or climb speed, it retainsthat as well. The creature’s type changes to undead, and it loses any subtypes it had in life. Do not recalculate thecreature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size isunchanged. Increase from the base dragon as follows: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, vam-piric dragons have no Constitution score. The creature’s type changes to undead, and it loses any subtypes it had in life. Do not recalculatethe creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size isunchanged. This zombie dragon has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if dis- tracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSIllus. by S. T appinZombie white dragonhis chapter presents 120 ready-to-play true dragon NPCs, one for each of the twelve age categories andten varieties. These dragons have the basic statistics given in the Monster Manual. Each entry includes notes about the dragon’s personality, combat tactics, and otherdetails of its life and habits. Some entries differ slightly from their Monster Manual counterparts because the skills and feats for some of them have been adjusted. Though the dragons are presented here as individuals, nearly any dragon described in this chapter could serve as amember of a dragon family, or in the case of younger dragons,the leader of a clutch. A clutch or family led by one of thesedragons tends to reflect the leader’s personality and tastes. CUSTOMIZING THE DRAGONS You can customize any sample dragon by altering its abil-ity scores. As presented here, each dragon’s ability scores(as given in the Monster Manual or another source) assume the standard array (all 11s and 10s), modified to take intoaccount the dragon’s racial ability adjustments. See Abil-ity Score Arrays, page 290 of the Monster Manual, for more information. To create an elite dragon, you could apply the elite array typically used for NPC ability scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.To apply the elite array to any dragon, assign the followingability score modifications as you see fit: +4, +4, +2, +2, +0, –2. Applying the elite array to a dragon increasesits Challenge Rating by 1. For a slightly less powerful dragon, use the non- elite array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. To apply this array toany dragon, assign the following ability score modi-fications as you see fit: +2, +2, +0, +0, –2, –2. Apply-ing the nonelite array to a dragon has no effect onits Challenge Rating. EXAMPLE Rime, the white wyrmling described on page 270,would have the following ability scores using theelite array: Str 15, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 11,Cha 4. Changing a dragon’s ability scores requires making several adjustments to its statisticsblock, as detailed below. A black dragon can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racialbonus on any Swim check to perform some special action oravoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. Thedragon can use the run action while swimming, provided itswims in a straight line. Blight Wyrmling Black Dragon Mean as the proverbial polecat, fiercely territorial, vain, andperpetually hungry, Blight tends to breathe acid first andconsider the consequences later. Blight thinks of herselfas the most dangerous creature in her patch of swamp. Sheis queen of all she surveys; however, she is a Tiny dragonand doesn’t actually survey very much. The mere sight ofany creature more attractive than herself (and that’s mostcreatures) fills Blight with rage. She delights in destroyingbeautiful things, especially birds and small animals. Like-wise, she scars small plants, trees, and even rocks just forthe fun of it.

Caster level 2nd; Will DC 14negates.Ysauraithus Young Blue Dragon Ysauraithus lives on a wide, dry steppe populated by horse-riding nomads. She has quite an appetite for horseflesh,but tries to limit her ravenous cravings in order to avoiddrawing the full wrath of the nomadic population uponherself. Some of the nomadic clans make regular offeringsof weak or injured horses to appease her, while otherssuffer occasional raids in which Ysauraithus makes a mealof a horse or two. Ysauraithus loves to fly, and soars for hours over her domain. As a result, she knows every knoll and gulch onthe steppe, and recognizes most of the creatures that dwellthere. Newcomers and strangers can count on a visit fromthe self-appointed queen of the steppe, but as long as theyfawn and grovel appropriately she usually lets them live—particularly if they offer her a horse. A bronze dragon can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racialbonus on any Swim check to perform some special action oravoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. Thedragon can use the run action while swimming, provided itswims in a straight line. Immersa Wyrmling Bronze Dragon Immersa is as playful as a dolphin and curious as a cat. Sheseldom sits still. Immersa loves animals, and makes frequentuse of her speak with animals ability . She has befriended almost every creature that swims, flies, or crawls along hersection of rocky seacoast. She finds humanoid fishers andhunters somewhat distasteful. While she would never denya being sustenance or a means of making a livelihood, sheremains alert for signs of over harvesting, killing for sport,or cruelty . From time to time, Immersa aids shipwreckedsailors, helping them to shore and sending them inlandtoward civilization. This gives her a good reputation amongthe local sailors even if the hunters and fishers don’t carefor her much. 223CHAPTER 5: SAMPLE A green dragon can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racialbonus on any Swim check to perform some special action oravoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. Thedragon can use the run action while swimming, provided itswims in a straight line. Blister Wyrmling Green Dragon Blister counts herself among the woodland nobility, alongwith the beasts of prey . She detests laughter and merri-ment, disliking elves and positively loathing pixies, grigs,and other carefree sylvan folk. She stalks through thetrees, high and low, sometimes winging over the forestcanopy, som etimes fluttering among the boles of the trees, sometimes slinking on foot. She has recently located thedwelling place of a band of pixies and has attempted sev-eral raids, but the pixies have thus far successfully evadedher attacks. Her last sortie left her entangled while thepixies danced about her and laughed before packing uptheir meager belongs and fleeing into the forest. Blisterhas sworn revenge. 247CHAPTER 5: SAMPLE Bluff +5, Diplomacy +6, Hide +4, Intimi- date +4, Knowledge (nature) +5, Listen +7, Search +5, SenseMotive +5, Spot +7, Swim +17; Alertness, Wingover.

At this stage of hislife, however, Chokedamp stands out more as a cunningnegotiator. He has forged a partnership with a pack ofworgs whose territory overlaps his own, and through theworgs, he has a loose alliance with a tribe of goblins. Choke-damp and the worgs make a formidable team. The worgs’hunting has improved greatly thanks to aerial reconnais-sance courtesy of Chokedamp, while the dragon has col-lected considerable booty from creatures the worgs havedefeated or sniffed out for the dragon. Still, Chokedampand the worgs distrust each other. The dragon finds theworgs’ failure to cower in his presence very annoying; heis aware that the whole pack probably could best him in afair fight and that annoys him too. Chokedamp also fearsthat the worgs’ goblin allies might raid his hoard while heis absent.

Rynskald Juvenile Green Dragon Though he loathes all kinds of sprites and mercilessly huntsthose who still dare to dwell in his forest, Rynskald haslearned to use some of their tricks against them. He is fondof using illusion cantrips to distract and disorient his foes,and laughs harshly every time a sprite—who should knowbetter—falls for one of his tricks. Of course, he usually stopslaughing as soon as he gets the creature in his mouth, but hehas been known to chuckle even while swallowing.

Shewastes no time in revealing herself to foes, usually by flyingoverhead to throw her shadow over a group or by perchingin a high place and imperiously demanding that charactersbehold her magnificent self. She expects lesser creaturessuch as humanoids to lavish praise upon her and extol herbeauty, strength, and grace. If she fails to get the praise shethinks is her due, she attacks. Characters who flatter Raazemust still endure her demands for tribute, and even if theypay up, find themselves invited to flatter her some more.Raaze never tires of hearing about herself, and usually doesnot let her victims go until they have provided a sum of trea-sure and assured her that she is simply too magnificent fortheir small minds to describe. A white dragon can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racialbonus on any Swim check to perform some special action oravoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. Thedragon can use the run action while swimming, provided itswims in a straight line. Rime Wyrmling White Dragon Rime takes savage joy in hunting and is happiest when clos-ing in for a kill. He delights in harrying and killing creatureslarger than himself. His favorite prey includes polar bearsand the occasional whale, provided he can catch the creaturein shallow water where it cannot readily escape. WhenRime is hungry, he’s not picky about what he hunts. 6 obsidian (9 each), 5 zircons (70 each), 4 black pearls (200 each), 8 aquamarines (700 each), 9 white opals(1,000 each), blue diamond (3,000), 5 platinum rings (50each), 4 keys carved from crystal (80 each), intricatelycarved darkwood cigar box (100), matched pair of gold gob-lets bearing inscription “Drink in good health” in Elven(100 each), 3 silver armbands bearing onyx lantern insignia(200 each), horse bridle set with moonstones (300), set ofsilk bedsheets (300), rough-hewn granite statue of dragonwith carnelian eyes (400), elegant leaded-glass perfumebottle with pegasus-shaped stopper (600), hickory-framedmirror set with four matching silver pearls (700), jeweledgold statuette of a toad (800), 6 matching intricately carvedcoral chairs (900 each), collection of leatherbound tomes ofreligious knowledge (grants +2 circumstance bonus onKnowledge [religion] checks) (1,000), silver-rimmed bonegoblet bearing symbol of Vecna (1,000), pair of sapphire ear-rings sized for Large creature (1,200 each), antique violinwith jade inlay (1,300), life-size stone statue of a halflingcleric of Yondalla with hand extended in friendship (1,300),oak armoire with mother-of-pearl inlaid symbols of Boccob(1,300) holding five sets of silken holy vestments bearingsymbol of Boccob (110 each), gold brooch set with tinyjacinth (1,400), silver belt studded with red garnets (1,400),fine painting of a golden sunrise in gold-gilt frame (1,500),polished onyx orb cunningly set with garnets, simulatingan orrery (1,600), 4 gold signet rings each bearing diamond“N” (2,000 each), intricate amethyst and gold chandelier(2,100), marble altar with symbol of Boccob inlaid in plat-inum and rubies (2,400). A dozen mephits from areas 3 and 8 come to greet any characters they see here. If you wishto have the characters encounter Sventsorggvireshearly, she too is close enough to catch sight of the char-acters when they reach the rim. DFire Mephits (6): hp 15, 14, 14, 13, 12, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual. DMagma Mephits (2): hp 16, 14; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual. DSteam Mephits (4): hp 15, 14, 13, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . Two to four mephits (some combina- tion of fire, steam, and magma types) are always hereeating, drinking, loafing, and (coincidentally) keepingwatch over the entrance to the lair. hp 13; see the mephit entry in theMonster Manual . hp 14; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . hp 12; see the mephit entry in theMonster Manual . A swarm of twelve fire, steam, and magma mephits is always here sleeping, playing knuck-lebones, or diving off the terrace outside into the lavapool some 250 feet below. DFire Mephits (4): hp 15, 13, 12, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . DMagma Mephits (4): hp 16, 15, 13, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . DSteam Mephits (4): hp 15, 14, 13, 13; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . As noted in the section above on Sventsorggviresh’s tactics, the dragon prefers to defendher lair here. If Sventsorggviresh can catch the party in this chamber, she flies in from the crater and tries todrive her foes toward area 5, using walls of force to restrict their movements as needed. In addition, shemay use bull rush maneuvers to force opponents downthe stairs. 5. GROTTO OF FIRE (EL 20 OR 0) The natural staircase from area 4 leads down 50 feet tothis area. The chamber is protected by the same forbid- dance effect that wards area 4. This grotto is noticeably hotter than area 4 (180 °F). The air stinks of sulfur and rotting flesh. This smellemanates from the 20-foot sinkhole at the end of the cor-ridor. A shaft about 16 feet across drops nearly straightdown to the lava pool in area 8, approximately 150 feetbelow. The shaft’s sides are smooth and well greasedfrom the scores of carcasses that Sventsorggviresh hasused to smear the walls over the years. The Climb DC is 30 for the walls in the shaft and the sinkhole, but this DC is reduced by 10 for a Colos-sal or Gargantuan climber. Any creature that falls intothe pit takes 15d6 points of falling damage, plus 20d6points of fire damage per round for immersion in themolten lava, plus an additional 10d6 points of firedamage each round for 1d3 rounds after leaving the pool. A Colossal or Gargantuan climber can use theshaft to slow the fall and take only 10d6 points offalling damage. If Sventsorggviresh has attacked the characters in the outer chamber (area 4), she tried tofinish the battle here. Sventsorggviresh spends most of her time in northwest spur of this cave, resting atop whatseems to be a mound of gems and coins at least 30 feetin diameter and 10 feet high. In fact, it is a pile of vol-canic sand with Sventsorggviresh’s hoard layered overit. If she has not already encountered the party else-where, she is here. A gang of ten fire, steam, and magma mephits are always here playing in the pool or in the airabove it. DFire Mephits (4): hp 15, 13, 12, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . DMagma Mephits (3): hp 15, 13, 12; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . DSteam Mephits (3): hp 14, 13, 13; see the mephit entry in the Monster Manual . The mephits use the same tactics as their comrades in area 1. If threatened, most flee toward area4, but a few head for area 7. ALTERING THE ADVENTURE Sventsorggviresh is a formidable opponent all by her-self. To make this adventure even more dangerous,however, you can give her a mate. She is most likely tochoose a younger male. Sventsorggviresh’s mate mightshare her chamber, but he is more likely to dwell inarea 4 or area 5. In such a case, Sventsorggviresh won’tbother with the programmed image in area 4, and woe to the party caught between the two dragons. Sventsorggviresh’s volcano, with its multiple cham- bers, also makes an ideal lair for a clutch of younger reddragons. Such a group of young dragons has probablydriven off the resident mephits, or at least thinnedtheir numbers considerably.

AZURIA, HALF-SILVER DRAGON/ HALF-DJINNI Despite their differing alignments, djinn and silver dragons share a heritage of elemental air. In fact, somesages have argued that genies and dragons may be dis-tantly linked in some way, pointing to the elementalnature of each creature as evidence. Whatever of the reason, it is not uncommon for a djinni and a silver dragon to find purpose and meaningin a common goal. Occasionally such a relationshipresults in children who, while undoubtedly genies,nevertheless display their draconic heritage. Azuria is such a creature, born of the union of dragon and djinni. She served in the court of Bahamutfor a short while, but left when she began to find thesurroundings too confining for her taste. Since then,she has wandered the planes, searching for a placewhere she feels comfortable and accepted. Thoughfriendly with both her parents’ races, she neverthelessknows that she doesn’t really belong with either.",

They lived peacefully until a hunter named Sharak killed a sacred stag, and all those who ate of the stag’s fl esh became ill. Many died, but others were transformed, twisted into hideous caricatures of humanity by the evil they had committed. The humans who escaped the curse scattered, leaving Desh to be lost forever. Those creatures who had once been human gathered together and fl ed as well, making their own way in the world but forever after hated by humans because they stood as a reminder of that sin. These became the sharakim. Sharakim live in small villages and towns. They are comfortable in hills and mountains, especially places that feature long shadows and high cliffs on every side. They are eager for outside contact, and thus settle close to other races. They make frequent forays to nearby towns and encourage their neighbors to visit them, whereupon they take the part of lavish hosts. Sharakim spend their waking hours fi ghting the impression people assume based on their appearance; only in the privacy of their own homes do they relax and gather their thoughts. Sharakim learn from early childhood that they were created from sin, and that others believe Sharakim, due to their their existence is a curse upon the world. This knowledge human roots, are a special makes them sullen when they are alone, and eager to breed indeed please when they are with other races. Humans compare them to puppies, which hate to be alone and accept any treatment because it means attention. Sharakim despise other orcs, seeing them as examples of what they could have become, and they make every effort to distinguish themselves from those monsters. They bathe frequently and are fastidious about their clothing and manners. They learn to speak Common and strive to pronounce the words without an accent, which is diffi cult because of their tusks. Sharakim villages are models of tidiness and order, each house carefully placed in relation to its neighbors, and each one kept spotlessly clean.

Any creature may learn diaboli tail code, although only creatures with tails of their own can \"speak\" it. Most diaboli who make the journey from their plane learn to speak Abyssal first, as their forked tongues can most easily form the words of that language.

Diaboli have a knack for making themselves at home on new planes. Diopsids are Underdark creatures that resemble a Diopsids are typically neutral. In the wild and dangerous lands of the Underdark, they are renowned for their ability to survive and mingle with a staggering range of creatures, from cruel drow and mind flayers to the friendlier svirfneblin and dwarves.

These simple but take pleasure in causing pain or misery. They simply effective tactics have taught many would-be enemies fight for their masters and rarely spread more havoc that diopsids are better met with barter than battle. than needed to defeat an enemy. Religion: Diopsids possess a simple set of beliefs that Diopsids lack names they can communicate in languages such as Common. The patterns of flashes they use have no analog. Thus, diopsids usually allow others to pick nicknames for them. Diopsids embrace new names and drop old ones with ease. They see such monikers as devices of communication devised by and for their trading partners and employers.

Some ride fast horses or dire wolves across the steppes to bring down deer, antelope, and elk while others stay nearer their longhouses to fish or pick berries and nuts. Lupins warily watch anyone who enters the lands they consider theirs but usually allow other races to move through their territory unmolested. They actively make war against goblinoids and gnolls who venture too close to the vast swaths of territory they travel. Lupins speak thickly accented Common among nonlupin visitors.

In general, tibbits find humanity\u0027s ambition, drive, and fiery passion intriguing. They consider dwarves overly dour. Elves strike them as kindred spirits, as tibbits appreciate that the long-lived races share a similar tendency to see issues from different perspectives. They adore gnomes and halflings and many good-aligned tibbits adopt such folk. More than one kobold or goblin party has descended upon a sleepy gnome village or halfling caravan only to find an enraged tibbit wizard waiting for them. Gnome and halfling folk who have benefited from such welcome surprises have strong traditions of taking care of stray cats and treating their feline pets as treasured companions. To a death master, poisoning a town\u0027s well, unleashing a horde of undead monsters against a sleeping village, and butchering innocents in the name of Orcus qualify as adventures. Only black-hearted villains follow this class. Death masters usually arise within the cults of Orcus. They study the sect\u0027s blasphemous texts, experiment with the production of undead, and master forbidden secrets. Other death masters are apprentice wizards and neophyte clerics who find necromancy too tempting to resist. These students uncover the principles of necromancy and study them in secret.

This duel is an important part of the bleeder\u0027s biological processes. The victorious bleeder lays its eggs within the slain opponent\u0027s corpse. After a brief incubation period, those eggs hatch into young bleeders. While bleeders can fly, sometimes these creatures roll along the ground to better engage their opponents or to take cover in preparation for an ambush. COMBAT Bleeders prefer to attack from ambush, particularly if they can strike from above. While bleeders usually attack a foe with their tentacles, their bulky, spherical bodies are suited to trampling opponents. A bleeder uses this attack mode to escape tight quarters. Blood Drain (Ex): A bleeder\u0027s tentacles deal 1 point of Constitution damage per round that they are attached to a victim. The bleeder drains blood from its victims and gathers it within its body. Keep track of the total Constitution damage a bleeder deals during an encounter, as it uses the blood it drains with its blood feeding ability. Tentacle Grapple (Ex): A bleeder gains the benefits of improved grapple when it strikes an opponent with its tentacles, with several exceptions.

The glasspane horror is a bizarre creature that is capable of assuming several different forms. Its shapechanging ability allows it to take the guise of a humanoid creature seemingly hewn from scintillating gemstones, a sheet of clear glass, or a whirling funnel cloud of stinging, crushed gems. In its glass from, the horror usually lurks within a window frame or similar position to pounce upon its enemies. Hence, the creature\u0027s name. Glasspane horrors make excellent guardians, and many powerful wizards and nobles seek them out as guards. The horrors consume gems to survive. Thus, a wealthy merchant can offer a glasspane horror a steady diet of high-quality diamonds, emeralds, and so forth in exchange for its service. Once a horror enters a contract, it does its best to live up to its bargain. A glasspane horror might wait patiently within its hiding place for days. While in its glass form, it is almost utterly inert. It can survive for years without feeding. While glasspane horrors are faithful servants, they are by no means bound to give their lives for their masters. A severely injured (10 hit points or less) horror flees to warn its master of any intruders. If a horror\u0027s employer is slain, the creature is freed from its bond.

A ghoul cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (6o-foot range). CREATING A RAVENOUS CREATURE \"Ravenous\" is a template that can be added to any corporeal undead (referred to hereafter as the \"base creature\"). It is most common among undead that feast on humanoid flesh, such as ghouls, ghasts, and some zombies. A ravenous undead possesses an exaggerated maw filled with especially sharp, jagged teeth. Some even sport multiple rows of teeth. It can also unhinge its jaw in order to take larger bites and feed its perpetual hunger all the quicker. A ravenous undead uses all the base creature\u0027s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. A ravenous creature retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a bite attack if it didn\u0027t already have one. Ravenous creatures have bite attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the damage values in the table below. Creatures with natural bite attacks deal damage as if they were one size larger on the table below or retain their original damage, whichever is better.

ANMEH’S HALL OF ODDITIES The façade of this building is covered with dozens of posters, many in tatters or out of date, depicting strange freaks of nature, monsters, and bizarre relics with catch- phrases such as “See the Wondrous Eel-Man!” and “Behold Nature’s Cruelest Trick: The Toad-Faced Dog!” and “Test Your Endurance in the Pit of Vile Ooze!” A huge sign over the main entrance proudly proclaims the place to be Anmeh’s Hall of Oddities; the sign fl ickers with a permanent faerie fi re. This place is just what it seems—a freak show and museum that caters to the exotic and unusual. Entrance costs only 1 sp, or 1 gp for the “honored guest tour,” a guided tour of the museum by Anmeh himself that includes access to the “secret exhibits.” These are usually a handful of upcoming displays that the rich can pay to see early.

A qorrashi (a kind of frost genie, see Frostburn, page 131) named Jusii (YOO-seyee) has created the sculptures and frost patterns. Because of his artistic temperament, Jusii found life among his almost universally lawful neutral people much too restrictive, so he exiled himself to the glacier, where he spends endless hours sculpting and painting, using small amounts of pure water instead of pigments. From time to time, he even ventures down the mountain and into more civilized areas, where he creates his frost paintings on whatever suitable surfaces he can find (most often windowpanes and frozen ponds). He only does so when cold weather prevails in the areas he visits, however. Jusii doesn\u0027t care for even moderate temperatures, and his art requires freezing temperatures or lower.

According to some theories, they have been imbued with power beyond all other animals to serve as nature’s defenders. Whatever their origin, leg- endary animals are extraordinarily rare. Not every animal has a legendary counterpart—there aren’t any legendary sparrows, for example. Generally only the top predators and largest herbivores in a partic- ular climate have legendary versions. Two examples are provided here: the legendary bear and legendary tiger. LEGENDARY BEAR A legendary bear doesn’t usually attack humans despite its great strength. Most of the bear’s diet consists of | plants and fish. COMBAT Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a legendary bear must hit with a claw attack. LEGENDARY TIGER The legendary tiger is among the fiercest and most dangerous land predators in the animal kingdom, measuring 8 to 10 feet long and weighing up to 600 pounds. COMBAT Pounce (Ex): If a legendary tiger leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the legendary tiger must hit with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake. Rake (Ex): A legendary tiger can make two attacks (+30 melee) against a held creature with its hind legs for 2d6 + 5 points of damage each. If the legendary tiger pounces on an opponent, it can also rake.

THE MONSTERS If you desire, you can change the directional ori- entation of this map to control how close the PCs are to the monsters when the encounter begins. For instance, if you want the PCs to start close to the ghasts and zombies, then they should approach along the street that’s adjacent to the buildings where the ghasts are located. If you want them to start as far away as possible from those monsters, then they should approach from the opposite end of that same street. If one or more PCs approach stealthily and the zombies don’t notice them, the ghasts emerge from the buildings in which they lurk and attack the zombies.

AFTER THE BATTLE The street quiets, and the disrupted mist begins to inch forward again to cloak the village in a blanket of hopelessness. The PCs are free to continue exploring the town, but they are at risk of random attacks by roving zombies (see page 24).

AFTER THE BATTLE If Doru is destroyed, the necromantic plague immediately ceases. All infected undead in the village instantly drop, now just ordinary corpses. If Strahd’s secondary goal is Undead Legions, destroying Doru alone is not enough to stop the necromantic infection. Only defeating Strahd himself can end the zombie plague forever (see Undead Legions, page 16). F A EATURES OF THE REA This chamber is a weird variant of an alchemist’s lab (PH 129). The furniture in the northwest corner is not tall enough or massive enough to provide cover or concealment. See Treasure in the E7A entry on page 28 for more information. The vertical beams holding up (most of) the floor of the church are not thick enough to provide cover or hinder movement. Doru’s Tactics Although it is not mindless, Doru the blaspheme has one overwhelming goal: Infect and kill all enemies. However, the monster dimly recognizes Danovich and does not attack the priest if he is present. Zombie Tactics On its turn, each zombie moves from its starting posi- 43 tion toward the closest enemy.

This rough-hewn, earthen tunnel is about 6 feet in diameter. A terrible stench emanates from somewhere deeper. Bits of gnawed remains— including a fi ngerbone and part of a skull—and scraps of torn, rotted clothes are partly embedded in walls worn by heavy use.

The tunnel opens up into a fetid earthen chamber whose stench is abominable. Corpses of humans, mostly eaten, are strewn about and partly trodden into the fl oor.

This is a sonic, mind- affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy’s song for 24 hours. A captivated creature walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A captivated creature within 5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard’s countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.

It tries to draw off one or more PCs so that the other creatures in the lair can deal with those remaining. The harpy maintains the effect until all resistance is dealt with; the others then attack captivated foes. Inka’s Tactics Inka prefers to attack with her claws and bite, hoping to paralyze and infect victims. She exploits her high speed, Tumble skill, Mobility, and Spring Attack to deliver attacks while staying away from opponents. If Inka drops to 9 hit points or below, she attempts to fl ee to the surface. She switches to her unarmed strikes if hard pressed so as to deal more damage. AFTER THE BATTLE If the PCs defeat the ghouls, they are free to search the cof- fi ns and the general area for treasure, as described in the E8 entry on page 28. If the PCs are in the graveyard at midnight, they observe the spirit procession described in the E8 entry. F A EATURES OF THE REA These coffins have been dragged here from the original site of burial and their contents eaten. Inka, the gra- vetouched ghoul monk, is resting in one of the coffins. If a PC opens the coffi n containing Inka, ask the players to roll initiative. The ghast in the western part of the area bursts forth from its hiding place, and the harpy also moves in to join Inka in the fi ght against the PCs. As her fi rst action, Inka attacks from a prone position. THE MONSTERS Ghouls (Ghasts): Identical to those described in encounter E6 on page 38.

Devil’s Garden Terrain: The press of devil’s trees and slippery goo that coats the parapet top is navigable, but makes for difficult terrain for Medium and larger creatures (except for Khyristrix, who is adapted to the environment). Difficult terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. PCs can’t run or charge across difficult terrain.

Catwalk (K58): The catwalk bridges the top of the parapet (K57) to the Dayheart landing (K60A). The slender stone and masonry bridge hangs in the swirling fog.

A crazy old man named Cyrus also can be found here (if he hasn’t already met the PCs elsewhere in the castle). He ignores any commotion in K61, but reacts as described on page 109 if any PCs open the door and enter this area. Kitchen (K65): Cyrus prepares horrid treats here. High Tower Staircase (K18): This stairwell is seemingly separate from the wine cellar. However, at the far south end of the west wall, a long crack allows easy access for gaseous creatures.

The base of the shaft lies in K84 and it rises to K59. a Strahd zombie (standing in the open next to the pot, Z on the map), a mohrg (hiding in the pot, marked M when it emerges), and a wight (hiding in a cabinet, marked W). The zombie ignores the PCs. It thrusts its hands into and out of the pot, splashing liquid around. It appears to be searching the contents of the pot for something, but in reality it is trying to keep the mohrg from getting out of the pot. RUNNING THIS ENCOUNTER If Cyrus is with the PCs, he grabs a wooden spoon from a countertop and moves toward the pot. He takes a few whacks at the zombie, then starts stirring the liquid, occa- sionally smacking something in the pot with the spoon. “I’m not the cook I used to be,” he yells while tending to whatever is in the pot. None of the undead creatures in this room attack Cyrus, but they turn against the PCs at the fi rst opportunity. If Cyrus remains with the PCs, he explains further. “Strahd says I can do what I want with the corpses. They have to listen to me.” This is true, as far as the three undead in this room go. Other undead will not attack Cyrus, but they won’t listen to him either. Cyrus totally believes what he says, nonetheless. If the PCs are on their own, the zombie continues to ignore them and the mohrg and wight remain hidden. When a PC gets close to the zombie, it suddenly forgets about the pot and turns to attack. The wight waits until the mohrg emerges to join in. A gangrenous arm reaches out of the pot and tries to grab you. A head and the rest of the body emerge next, dripping wet and in an advanced state of decay. 166 5566KK RREETTNNUUOOCCNNEE Strahd Zombie CR 2 HP 40 __________________________________________________ NE Medium undead (humanoid) Init +0; Senses darkvision 60 ft.; Listen +0, Spot +0 AC 16, touch 10, flat-footed 16 HD 6 Immune mind-affecting, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, energy drain Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +5 Speed 30 ft.

This stairway is dark. It steeply climbs 40 feet up to room K23. MONSTERS The following creatures are active in this area: This creature looks like any other zombie, except that it is harder to dispatch. Thick, dusty cobwebs hang from the ceiling of this long passage. The webs grow thicker farther down the hall, almost completely fi lling the western end and the alcoves around it. PCs examining the end of the hall can make a DC 18 Spot check to notice that there are bones visible within the thicker clumps of web to the west. Anyone who makes a DC 24 Spot check notices the web golem hiding among the thick ceiling webs. Any PCs who make the higher Spot check can participate in the surprise round along with the web golem. MONSTERS This vaguely humanoid-shaped creature (W) is composed entirely of layer-upon-layer of spider webs, except for its eight spider-like eyes and sharp mandibles. Bar-lguras: These two demons (B on the map) look very much like lumbering orangutans, and the malevolent gleam in their eyes indicates that they really do want to rend fl esh and eat the innards of any who get too close. This creature (R) appears crude, bestial, and misshapen. It howls and writhes in pain as its corrupted body continues to mutate. [curse, dispel good] These zombies look much like any other zombie—decaying fl esh, tattered clothes, plodding mannerisms—except that they prove to be extremely harder to destroy. When a PC is teleported into a cell that contains a Strahd zombie, the undead creature slowly rises out of the water to attack. Two of these creatures (R) help protect the area from intruders. They appear as hairless, ape-like creatures with cancerous blemishes that disfi gure their yellow-green fl esh. An ichor-slicked tentacular tongue protrudes from a rot reaver’s mouth. The tongue winds around one of the creature’s thick arms, looping down to lick the blades of the cleavers it wields in each hand. They work as a team, converging on the same target to fl ank and slice. They prefer to attack any PCs carrying light or radi- ating daylight, seeking to douse the light in the brackish water.

PCs can make DC 20 Knowl- edge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion) checks to recognize this creature as a powerful form of ghoul. A great stone ring stands on its end against the west wall of the crypt. Disturbing glyphs and pictograms decorate the stone ring, which frames a shimmering curtain of green mist full of shifting stars, fl ashes of light, and blossoms of dark clouds. As one fl ash of light bursts through an expanding cloud of darkness, a terrible creature steps out of the ring and fi lls the crypt with its hulking form. MONSTERS AND TACTICS VAULT The monsters in this chamber start out in the stone coffi ns spread out across the room. There are one shadow (S), one wraith (Wr), and thirteen wights (W) in this area. If the PCs enter the vault by descending from the shaft, combat begins when a PC opens a coffi n. The undead in the coffi n rises and attacks. In the following round, 1d4+1 wights become active, rising from their coffi ns to join in the battle against the PCs. Repeat this every round until all thir- teen wights have emerged. The wights chase and attack any PCs who remain in the vault. They will not leave the chamber. The shadow emerges from its coffi n as soon as it gets to act. It moves toward the near- est PC and tries to sap that PC’s Strength until the target drops or the shadow is destroyed. If the shadow succeeds, it moves on to the nearest PC to repeat the process. The wraith emerges on its action in a spectral rage, ready to extinguish the life from the intruding PCs.

An entan- gled creature can escape with an Escape Artist check (DC 20) or burst the web with a Strength check (DC 26). The web has 6 hit points and takes double damage from fire. An entangled creature gets a +5 bonus on an attempt to escape or burst the webbing if she can grab onto something (such as the unwebbed wall or a pole held by a strong ally) while trying to pull free. The web can support 100 pounds of weight. Any more weight than that causes key strands to break and plunges the web and all it carries to the bottom of the pit, where those within the web remain entangled. Falling creatures take 2d6 points of damage and may not make Jump or Tumble checks to reduce this damage.

Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a success- ful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free.

Githzerai live within self-contained, fortresslike monasteries hidden deep in the swirling chaos of Limbo. While disorder rules outside, stability holds sway inside. Each monastery is ultimately under the control of a sensei, a monk of at least 16th level, and follows a strict schedule of chants, meals, martial arts training, and devotions, according to a particular sensei’s philosophy. A monastery contains noncombatants (mostly children) equal to 15% of the fighting population.

        "merged_description":  "Running the City focuses on provid- ing advice to DMs about how to run urban campaigns. It discusses the importance of history in a city, and how history drives ongoing stories, which dovetails into an analysis of the city as an adventuring environ- ment, including how-to tips on dungeon crawling and ways to keep the setting “alive,” by means of NPC and location management. The chapter concludes with an overview of city crime and punishment. Most of the material in this section is, of course, intended for Dungeon Masters. WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY Cityscape makes use of the information in the three core rulebooks—the Player’s Handbook (PH), Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG) , and Monster Manual (MM) . This book also draws on or references information in other supplements, including Dungeon Master’s Guide II, Unearthed Arcana, and Heroes of Horror . Those titles make excellent sup- port references for urban adventuring, but they are not required in order to make full use of Cityscape. 620_95386_Ch1.indd 6620_95386_Ch1.indd 6 8/21/06 4:42:34 PM8/21/06 4:42:34 PMhe first thing to consider as a Dungeon Master p l a n n i n g a n u r b a n c a m p a i g n i s w h a t t r u l y makes a city. Cities proper differ from other communities in many ways, but population is the primary factor. However, the numbers stated on Table 5–2 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide repre- sent average city populations and can vary depending on the campaign. If you decide to adjust the numbers, you should retain the relative sizes of communities. For example, if your world is populated with roughly twice as many people as is assumed in the default fantasy setting, simply multiply the numbers in the table by 2. In such a case, a thorp could contain up to 160 adults, while a large city might contain as many as 50,000 adults. A city’s “persona” also makes it unique. Unlike smaller communities, which tend to resemble their surroundings, a true city has a character all its own, developed by the people, ideas, and events that have shaped its history. This persona manifests itself in the city’s physical characteristics, such as its layout and architecture. An urban center planned in advance, using a traditional grid shape, is going to look and feel different from one that developed organically over time. Most cities are divided into districts whose character and layout reinforce the overriding persona. A city with several mercantile districts, for example, is clearly focused on commerce, while one with an embassy district is likely a capital or other politically active urban center. A complete breakdown of district types, and the typical features of each, begins on page 34. ALIGNMENT A fundamental aspect of any major urban center is the moral and ethical outlook of its populace. The alignment of a city’s power center ( DMG 138) is certainly inﬂ uential, but the overall attitude of the city’s inhabitants, known as the community align- ment, is separate from that of any leader or group of leaders. A given city’s community alignment depends not only on the mindset of its leaders, but also the history of the region, the indigenous cultural mores, and even the local geography. Speciﬁ c individuals have their own alignments, but the community alignment represents the city’s overall cultural outlook. In most fantasy settings, the default commu-nity alignment is lawful, representing a popular 7 Illus. by D. BirchamIllus. by D.

Often a city’s outlook has no bias toward good or evil, which is typical of humans in general. A typical campaign also assumes that humans are the dominant race. Cities founded or dominated by nonhuman races could have very different attitudes, often reﬂ ecting the typical racial alignment (such as chaotic good for elves or lawful good for dwarves). Consult the table below when randomly determining the community alignment of any sizable urban center— typically, a community larger than a small town. Community Alignment d% Alignment 01–20 Lawful good21–28 Neutral good29–36 Chaotic good37–61 Lawful neutral62–67 Neutral68–69 Chaotic neutral70–89 Lawful evil90–95 Neutral evil96–100 Chaotic evil Cities by Type The following example cities serve a dual purpose. Each has a name and demographic detail so it can be dropped as-is into almost any campaign. An example city can form the basis for long-term urban adventures, or be simply a brief stopping point for PCs on their way to some other destination. These entries also serve as models, much like the terrain material in prior environment books. Each demonstrates the most typical features of its function, whether military, commercial, or political. You can simply replace the names and details with your own, or construct your own cities that follow similar patterns.BLACKWALL (THE MILITARY CITY) Surprising though it seems, given the frequency of wars and the presence of so many monsters, many communities—even some great cities—have no defenses at all. The reasons for this deﬁ ciency could include insuf- ﬁ cient wealth, a recent attack that obliterated previous fortiﬁ cations, or being located in a peaceful region that makes defenses unnecessary. Foul-smelling monsters, such as ghasts or troglodytes, have moved into the tannery district, using its stench to mask their own odor. Here they hide, preying with impunity on the populace of nearby districts. THEATER Often—monstrous. Buildings: Temples (2%; monstrous deities), poor lodging (6%), poor food (13%), average trades (5%), poor trades (17%), average services (5%), poor services (20%), poor residences (30%). Description: Every city has its “underground,” an area of criminal activity or black-market sales, but in some communities the term is literal. The undercity lies beneath the streets, a thriving shadow community in which criminals and monsters interact, do business, and kill one another. The district might consist of aban- doned sewage or mining tunnels, natural caves, forgotten catacombs, the ruins of long-abandoned buildings, or combinations of these elements. The precise appearance and ambience of the undercity depend on its inhabitants and structure, but most such districts are musty from stale air, and often unsanitary. Although the mere existence of an under- city is often a sufﬁ cient excuse for adventuring, a twist on the usual sewer crawl has the PCs chase a fugitive into the undercity. They navigate this strange new environment in order to track down their quarry, rather than as an end in itself. They risk incurring the wrath of more criminals, and monsters besides, for invading their territory. WAREHOUSE This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take the feat, its effects apply to a new culture, geographic region, kingdom, or nation ( whichever is appropriate). Note: In the E BERRON setting, you can substitute the Favored in House feat for Favored as the prerequisite for this feat. If you do, you gain the beneﬁ ts of this feat while within any of the Five Nations. STRONG STOMACH You have greater resilience to illness and foul odors than most people. Prerequisites: Con 13, Endurance. Beneﬁ t: You reduce the effects of sickening and nausea by one step. You cannot become nauseated. If you are exposed to an effect or condition that would normally make you nauseated, you become sickened instead. If an effect or condition would normally sicken you, that effect is negated. SWIFT TUMBLER You can ﬂ ip, twist, and roll with great speed. You might have learned this ability by traversing the city’s rooftops and alleys, or simply by moving through the throng day after day. Prerequisite: Tumble 7 ranks. Beneﬁ t: When tumbling, you move at a speed equal to half your base speed +10 feet. Normal: W i th o u t th i s f e a t , c h a r a c t e r s m o v e a t h alf speed when tumbling. URBAN TRACKING You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities. Beneﬁ t: To ﬁ nd an individual’s trail, or to follow a trail for 1 hour, requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour you search, as well as each time the trail becomes more difﬁ cult to follow, such as when it takes you to a different part of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on on the community size and the prevailing conditions. If you fail a check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning; the DM should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn’t know exactly how much time the task will require. You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (from 1 hour to 30 minutes), but you take a –5 penalty on the check. Obviously, this feat will not allow you to locate someone who has gone beyond the boundaries of the community, but it could inform you that they’ve done so.

An urban savant is an expert on the local community. If something has been around for a while, you’ve likely either heard stories about it or had direct contact with it. You can draw upon this extensive familiarity to gain certain benefits against the following types of creatures: aberrations, animals, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, oozes, and vermin (all of which are commonly found within the urban environment). The DM can modify this list as needed, replacing any creature type here with any other type appropriate to the campaign, or adding new ones. The benefits conferred are detailed in the descriptions below. As you grow in experi- ence, you unearth new uses for your growing urban knowledge. Using this ability re- quires you to succeed on an appropriate DC 15 Knowledge check (see the Knowledge skill, PH 7 8 ), made as a mov e ac -tion.

Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged. Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s. Plague, crime, and monsters are all rampant, because the city cannot or will not deal with the causes of these problems. Adventurers are desperately needed, but the rewards are low. 8. The middle and upper classes have received a major influx of riches in the past few generations, perhaps due to local mining or the immigration of wealthy merchants. Effect on City: Gold and silver have grown so common as to be devalued; goods and services cost 25% to 100% more than their standard values, and those among the poor who have not grown richer are now even less able to afford what they need. Those few who beneﬁ t from the inﬂ ux—the mining guilds, or nobles who are being paid off by the rich merchants—have grown corrupt, and seek to main- tain the status quo by any means necessary. If someone does not ﬁ nd a way to change the situation, many of the poor will literally starve to death. 9. When the city was founded, the land on which it stands was taken, by either deceit or force, from the people or creatures who dwelt there. Effect on City: Ruins and relics still exist beneath or around the city. At 5th level, the druid gains the ability to transform into an animal, as per the standard wild shape ability. She can do this once a day to start with, but the frequency of her wild shapes increases as per the standard druid advancement chart. At 8th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into Large animals. Instead, she may transform into Small and Medium vermin, as well as animals. At 11th level, the druid gains the ability to transform into Tiny animals and vermin.At 12th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into plant creatures. Instead, she may transform into an animal- or vermin-based swarm, so long as it fits within her standard wild shaping Hit Die limits. At 15th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into Huge animals. Instead, she gains the ability to transform into Large animals and vermin. 1st.Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain Track as a bonus feat.Benefit: He gains Urban Tracking (Cityscape 64) as a bonus feat. Voice of the City For some, the ability to make oneself understood in the midst of any culture is of far greater value than the ability to influence the beasts of the wild. Astaroth constantly whispers the secrets of reality in the back of your mind, allowing you to draw on his own nigh-infinite knowledge. This functions as the bardic knowledge ability (PH 28), based on your effective binder level. Astaroth\u0027s Breath: Once every 5 rounds, you can exhale a 60-foot cone of foul-smelling gas. Creatures within the cone must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round and sickened for an additional 1d4 rounds. Those who make the save are merely sickened for 1 round. Creatures immune to poison or disease are immune to this effect. Desharis grants abilities that reflect his desire to protect the civilized peoples of the world, plus provides a few that show his anger at the fey and other creatures of nature. City-Dweller: While hosting Desharis, you move at your normal rate when moving through a crowd, rather than requiring two squares of movement for every square as is normal. In addition, you gain a +6 competence bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks (and may use the latter even if you have 0 ranks in it). You may attempt to smite an animal, elemental, fey, or plant with a single melee attack. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack roll and deal 1 extra point of damage per effective binder level. If you accidentally smite a creature that is not one of the above types, the attempt has no effect. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.Cityscape, Part 2",

BLUE SOCIETY Blues are often poorly integrated into a goblin tribe. Common goblins rail against them (but not in their presence) and leaders don\u0027t trust them: It is not uncommon for blues to be killed by their own kin out of fear. As such, blues are often extremely paranoid—those that survive do so because they have become cruel, cunning, and dangerous. Blues live apart in a cave of their own, but since they depend on the tribe for protection, they do not often stray too far. In a tribe containing more than one blue, a “Blue Council” may secretly gain control and thereafter manipulate the titular leader from behind the scenes. Such tribes are far COMBAT more dangerous than those that slay their blues early on. Brain moles lurk in groups of at least three within the mouth of a burrow, hiding as best they can.

GITHYANKI SOCIETY Mind flayers enslaved entire races, including the githyanki forerunners. Centuries of captivity bred hate, nurtured resolve, and finally instilled psionic powers. With mental armaments of their own and a powerful leader to rally behind (the legendary Gith), the slaves instigated a crossplanar struggle that, in the end, threw down the illithid empire, bringing freedom to the surviving slaves. However, these soon split into the racially distinct githyanki and their mortal enemies, the githzerai (see the Githzerai entry, below). Each constantly attempts the extinction of the other. This animosity has burned through the centuries, warping the githyanki into the evil, militaristic creatures they are today. Both peoples\u0027 hatred of the mind flayers knows no bounds, though, and they will break off hostilities to slay illithids if the opportunity presents itself. Githyanki live within massive fortresses adrift in the Astral Plane. Here they conduct commerce, manufacture goods, grow food, and live out their lives. Family dwellings are nonexistent, as most githyanki prefer their own abode; however, githyanki are often found in groups, honing their fighting skills. A fortress contains noncombatants (mostly children) equal to 20% of the fighting population. Githyanki males and females may be found in almost any role or class. The githyanki have no deity but instead pay homage to a lich-queen. A jealous and paranoid overlord, she devours the essence of any githyanki that rises above 16th character level Besides eliminating potential rivals, the lich-queen enhances her power with the stolen life essence. 7-8 HD (Medium- size); 9-12 HD (large) Skills: *When it consumes a brain, “A big brain on four the intellect devou- legs” describes an rer absorbs some of the victim\u0027s memo- intellect devourer. ries, gaining a +5 The creature stalks living prey, sometimes at the behest of powerful masters, competence and co-opts their bodies after devouring the brain. bonus on Perform (act) checks when trying to pass off the possessed body as the A closer look reveals that the intellect devourer\u0027s 2- footdIameter brain is protected by a impervious, transparent original crust, and its legs are bestially jointed with cruel claws.

DESTROY ARTILLERY (6TH) The enemy has a field of fire along a relatively clear approach, with two batteries of catapults to threaten the area. The PCs’ commander wants to attack at dawn the next day, but if the catapults are not destroyed or disabled by then, the strike will turn into a slaughter. The commander depends on the PCs to disable or destroy the enemy’s catapults on a strike mission during the moonlit night. The enemy has two emplacements, emplacements.

GET ’EM OUT ALIVE! (10TH) Intelligence has determined that the duke and a small number of POWs are being held in a makeshift enemy camp in the hills on the other side of a nearby forest. It is believed the duke will soon be moved to a more secure location, so the PCs must act now if they wish to rescue him. To further entice the characters to perform this mission, let it be known that one of the PC’s siblings was with the prince when he was taken prisoner. For a 7th-level group accom- panied by 4 human elite soldiers (page 143), the camp contains the following enemies, half of which are on duty at all times: 12 orcs (Monster Manual page 203), 8 gnolls (Monster Manual page 130), 4 ogres (Monster Manual page 199), 2 ogre brutes (page 146). For a 13th-level group accompanied by 4 elite guard majors (7th-level fighters; use Human Sniper Major, page 143), the camp contains the following enemies, half of which are on duty at all times: 12 ogres (Monster Manual page 199), 8 ogre brutes (page 146), 4 ogre mages (Monster Manual page 200), 1 troll hunter (Monster Manual page 247). 53 ENCOUNTERS BATTLEFIELD CHAPTER 3 KING OF THE HILL (10TH) Several hill giants are throwing rocks from a rocky knoll on the battlefield, surrounded by enemy troops. The PCs must take the hill, then defend it from further incursions while the main force pushes forward. A squad of hill giants stands atop the hill, hurling rocks into the battle below. The giants are accompanied by a squad of ogre brutes who cheer them on and place bets on who throws the farthest. If the giants fall, a nearby squad of trolls takes note and begins climbing the hill. If the trolls are also repelled, two fire giant soldiers lead their ogre brute squads in an effort to reclaim the hill. • 4 hill giants (Monster Manual page 123) • 5 ogre brutes (page 146) • 10 trolls (Monster Manual page 247) force abandons any further attempts to take the hill.

Fortunately, armies of demons are seldom seen on the Material Plane. On the Outer Planes, a tanar’ric horde might march into battle against celestial hosts or devilish brigades. Battles could be fought on any of the Outer Planes, and war eternal is waged on the Infernal Battlefield of Acheron. A typical tanar’ric horde is led by a marilith; a balor commands mul- tiple hordes in larger battles. The natural chaotic tendencies of demons do not allow for much of a command structure beneath the leader. The tanar’ric horde presented here consists primarily of masses of dretches, herded toward the enemy by massive hezrou. The marilith commander watches the battle unfold, sending vrock aerial assaults and babau gangs toward the places where they can cause the most damage. Tanar’ric hordes are far from uniform: Two hordes might bear virtually no resemblance, other than the appetite for death and destruction. Nalfesh- nee and glabrezu sometimes lead a horde. The most dangerous hordes use hezrou for rank-and-file instead of dretch. Command Retinue EL 17: The commander of this horde is a marilith. She neither trusts nor desires any bodyguard or sup- port troops, since any demon would be better put to use on the front lines. Unless she is somehow caught unawares, any encounter with the marilith would be one that she initiated, and she uses her greater teleport ability to choose her battles. If hard-pressed, she will try to summon a glabrezu or nalfeshnee to finish off her foes, but she hates to show weakness in such a manner. If the attack misses the target square, roll success on this check this grants the crew chief a +2 bonus on 1d8 and consult the diagram below to determine the deviation his check. of the throw. The ammunition lands 3 squares away from the Next, the catapult must be loaded. As with aiming, loading target square for every range increment of the attack. a catapult requires one or more full-round actions taken by the crew members. As before, multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions at the same time, reducing the time it takes to load the catapult (for example, if the catapult requires four full-round actions to load, a crew of four can load it in a single round). The crew chief must succeed on a DC 15 Profes- sion (siege engineer) check, and at least one member of the crew must succeed on a DC 10 Strength check. Other members of the crew can assist with either of these checks by using the aid another action but must choose which check to aid (that is, the same crew member cannot assist in both rolls). Large or larger creatures load a catapult in half the given time, while Small creatures require twice the given time. Tiny creatures can’t load a catapult. Finally, the crew chief makes a special attack roll to fire the catapult. He rolls 1d20 and adds his base attack bonus, his In- telligence modifier, any penalty for range increments (see Table 4–1), and any other modifiers that apply (see the remainder of this sidebar). A square on the battlefield is treated as having AC 15 against a catapult’s attack. This attack is a standard action, and the attack roll can’t be assisted by the crew. Catapults (other than ballistae) hurl their ammunition in a high arc. A catapult requires vertical clearance equal to half the range to the target to operate, so subterranean races rarely use such devices. Because of this high arc, catapults can strike squares that aren’t in line of sight of the crew, though at a –6 penalty on the attack roll. If the attack fails to hit a target that is in line of sight of the crew, and the catapult’s next shot targets the same square, the crew chief gains a +2 bonus on his special attack roll. If succes- sive shots at the same square continue to miss, this bonus im- proves by 2 on every additional attempt to hit the same square, up to a maximum of +10 (after five straight misses). pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs 66 4 RETPAHC FO SELUR RAW aims at either a creature or an object (such as a section of wall) rather than a square. Loading a light ballista requires two full-round actions (that is, two crew members can load it in a single full round). Loading a heavy ballista requires four full-round actions. A ballista need not be reaimed; each attack suc- ceeds or fails independent of previous attack rolls. A light ballista takes up a 5-foot square, while a heavy ballista takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot space. The battering ram is a simple device consisting of a heavy pole—either suspended by ropes from a movable scaffold or held aloft by troops—that is repeatedly smashed into a gate or other barrier to break it down. The end of the pole is often shod in iron, which can be forged into a variety of decorative shapes such as dragon heads. The typical battering ram is 30 feet long. Including its scaffolding, it occupies a space 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. Up to ten Medium or Small troops can occupy the same space as the ram and its scaffolding, in two rows of five (one row on either side). Larger creatures can contribute to the attack as long as they share at least one square of their space with the ram. As a full-round action, the character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the AC of the target construction, applying the –4 penalty for lack of proficiency (it’s not possible to be proficient with this device). In addition to the damage given on Table 4–1: Siege Engines, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their Strength Loading a light mangonel requires a total of two full- modifier to the ram’s damage, if they devote a full-round round actions (taking one full round for a crew of two, action to doing so (the character guiding the ram adds any or two full rounds for a single crew member).

Faun Society Fauns are native to pastoral settings such as pleasant wood- lands and quiet groves. They live in loose bands with no govern- ment or hierarchy. They often associate with satyrs, centaurs, dryads, and nymphs. Unlike satyrs, fauns are amenable to interaction with human society; they are not as xenophobic as their cousins are. Indeed, they are somewhat intrigued by the nuances of human culture, particularly accomplishments in philosophy and the arts, and they strive to imitate human culture even when they do not have exten- sive contact with it.

It does not become a eyeless savage leaping through the wood, the effete noble new incarnum wraith. with a penchant for bloodletting, and even the griffon that descends upon hapless travelers in the wild with his gore-encrusted beak and talons—all these creatures and more are lost. Forever separated from its mortal brethren, a lost is pinned to the depths of hate and rage by a single wisp of pure incarnum. A lost is created when a passing strand of uncontrolled soul energy strikes a creature that happens to share its negative emotional state at that moment. For example, a human who is angry at a merchant for fl eecing him out of his hard-earned silver might encounter a strand of incarnum that embodies anger in the alley near the merchant’s stall. The incarnum permanently bonds the wrath to the man’s soul and amplifi es it until it becomes blind rage. This bonding process fi ercely intensifi es the creature’s heartbeat, making it audible at a distance of 5 feet with a DC 20 Listen check. Once the bonding is complete, the creature gains the lost template. Each lost appears as a deformed version of its former self, though the type and extent of the deformities vary widely from one individual to another. The creature’s mental stability is also hampered to a greater or lesser extent based on the emotion to which it is bound. For example, a lost dwarf who has retained his wits might wear a single glove to cover the twisted remains of his fi ngers, while a lost human blacksmith might drool, twitch, and stumble like a mad dog. None but the most deviously insane lost bother with dress or personal upkeep; they simply sleep where they can and let their clothes deteriorate into rags. But even a lost that successfully disguises its nature cannot escape its traitorous heart. Thus, the rare lost that attempts to masquerade as fully humanoid haunts noisy public places to mask its telling heartbeat. No lost has ever been restored to its former state, but sages speculate that a method might exist to redeem at least some of these creatures. The exact means of doing so is left to the DM to devise, but it should require a quest Incarnum wraith of some sort. Illus. by A.

        "merged_description":  "They are not often aware of it, and would be insulted if someone else were to suggest it, but the drow live every day of their lives in mortal terror. They fear their masters and priestesses, they fear the treachery of underlings, they fear displeasing their deity, they fear losing power and falling into disgrace. This fear engenders the paranoia and distrust that keep the drow from growing close, and the secrecy in which they orchestrate their schemes. For all their cru- elty, all their power, the drow are bitterly fearful creatures, always afraid to lose what they have, yet driven to risk it all for just a little bit more. Everything the drow do stems from the interactions between these three emotions, bolstered by societal pressures.

AMBUSH FEATS Ambush feats, introduced in Dragon Magazine and expanded upon in Complete Scoundrel, allow you to use your sneak attack ability to deal an additional harmful or hindering effect upon an opponent, at the cost of one or more of the extra damage dice you normally deal with a successful hit. You must declare your intent to use an ambush feat’s ability before making your attack roll and you must always deal at least one extra die of sneak attack damage with the attack (that is, you can’t reduce the number of sneak attack bonus damage dice to 0). You can apply multiple ambush feats to the same attack as long as you still deal at least one extra die of damage with the attack. Creatures immune to sneak attacks are immune to the secondary effects created by ambush feats. Even if a creature is vulner- able to sneak attacks, if your attack deals no damage to the creature (for example, if it is negated by the creature’s damage reduction), the secondary effect doesn’t occur. As noted in Complete Adventurer, the sudden strike class fea- ture can be used in place of sneak attack in qualifying for feats. Furthermore, whenever an ambush feat mentions sneak attack, you can substitute sudden strike. The skirmish ability of a scoutCAd doesn’t count as a sneak attack for the purpose of qualifying for feats, nor may a scout sacrifi ce skirmish extra damage to gain the benefi t of an ambush feat.

Serpentirs are unnatural predators, preferring to stalk foes from the shadows rather than face them in a stand-up fi ght. Their talent for stealth and their speed make them favor quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics. Strategies and Tactics A serpentir conceals itself from foes whenever possible, shadowing them for hours as it sizes up their abilities and learns their habits. It takes great delight in attacking without warning, using walls, ceilings, and difficult terrain to its advantage. A serpentir attempts to grapple a weak-looking creature, draw that foe into its churning ribs, then retreat. If it has had Serpentir time to prepare, it takes a preplanned escape route that is 158 DROL LLUKS lekewS .A yb .sullI difficult for foes to follow, such as a steep mine shaft or a serpentir is slain, Dramethius and his three vampire rubble-filled corridor.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a rug of welcome must hit a creature of its size category or smaller with its grab attack. (The rug has a +4 racial bonus on its grab attacks, already ﬁ gured into the statistics above.) It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold. The creature ’s type changes to construct. It loses all subtypes and does not gain the aug- mented subtype. Recalculate base attack bonus, saving throws, feats, and skills accordingly as described below. Hit Dice and Hit Drop any Hit Dice gained from class lev- els (to a minimum of 1 ) and change re- maining Hit Dice to d10s. As a construct, the creature loses any bonus hit points for high As base creature. As a construct, an ef ﬁ gy creature ’s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice (as a cleric). An ef ﬁ gy loses all the special qualities of the base creature, but it gains the special qualities given below. Damage Reduction (Su): An ef ﬁ gy gains damage reduction based on the base creature ’s Hit Dice: Hit Dice Damage Reduction 1–3 1/adamantine 4–6 3/adamantine 7–10 5/adamantine 11–15 7/adamantine 16–20 10/adamantine 21 or more 15/adamantine Same as base creature +1. A water monolith has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE Past the timeless eons that lie between the stars, pseudonatural creatures dwell beyond the planes as we know them, nestled in far realms of insan- ity. When summoned to the Material Plane, they often take on the form and abilities of familiar creatures, though they are more gruesome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. Alternatively, they might appear in a manner more consistent with their origins, manifesting as masses of writhing tentacles or other even more terrible-looking forms. SAMPLE PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE This ﬂ apping horror has a vaguely horse- like body with the forelegs and wings of a huge, foul bird. Grotesque pustules erupt from its ﬂ esh, ichor oozing from the vari- ous extrusions, and a long, serpentine tail thrashes behind the creature. This example uses a 3 HD hippogriff as the base creature.Pseudonatural Hippogriff Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. Almost every seeker of the song aims to take levels in the seeker of the song prestige class, though not all will attain that goal. Those most passionate about seeking the primal music generally focus on the bard ’s path Symbol of the Seekers of the SongIllus. by D.

Though uncommon, many of the most powerful and accomplished seekers have levels in other bardlike prestige classes such as the stormsinger (from Frostburn ) and the war chanter (from Complete Warrior ). M o s t m e m b e r s o f t h e s e e k e r o f t h e s o n g p r e s t i g e c l a s s belong to the order, but many evil bards with levels in the prestige class eschew the order to pursue the primal music exclusively for their own ends. Lore of the Seekers: Seekers spread and believe in many different tales regarding the origin of the primal music. The one that has the most boisterous adherents (and sees the most rancorous debate) posits that some three thousand years past, an angelic being named Karoninwaithe brought the sounds of the primal music to Haeldriss Fey, an elf bard of great skill who devoted the rest of his days to spreading the primal music and seeking to more fully understand its power. Other sages (and even some seekers as well) claim that Karoninwaithe was actually a ﬁ end in disguise, and that the music that the seekers touch is actually a form of infernal power. Those who espouse this theory believe in the captivating nature of the music, and they point out how creatures once controlled by a powerful seeker are often driven to seek further exposure to the primal music. Two senior students are stationed between the two pairs of gates. They rotate every eighthours, but their schedules are staggered, with onechanging at midnight, the other at 4 AM, and so forth around the clock.

Shehad the camp chairs brought in to replace thethronelike chair that her predecessor used. Importantmeetings and strategy sessions take place around thetable.

However, in on the other side, you can’t cross the barrier. Some obstacles may dungeons and wilderness areas, that’s often not the case. also require a skill check to cross (such as Climb of Jump). Difficult terrain, such as rubble, an uneven On the other hand, some obstacles, such as floor-to-ceiling walls, cave floor, thick undergrowth, and the like, hampers movement. block movement entirely. A character can’t move through a Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. blocking obstacle. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles though squares.) You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain. a floor-to-ceiling wall blocks a flying creature as well as a landbound creature. If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow. through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. (This is particularly true for creatures whose space fills more than one square, such as a giant.) You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. For instance, an ogre (whose space is 10 feet, or 2 squares, wide) can squeeze through or into a space at least 5 feet (1 square) wide. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC. When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that’s one square wide, the creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into. A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square. To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill (page 73). You can’t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC. Special Movement Rules These rules cover special movement situations. Some- times a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. For example, you might incur an attack of opportunity from a monk while moving through a friend’s square and become stunned. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer. 148 :8 RETPAHC TABMOC creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can’t flank an enemy. and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures: Very large (just as two diagonal moves normally do). creatures take up more than 1 square. For instance, an ogre (Large) If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 takes up a space 10 feet on a side (2 squares wide). squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two they aren’t in adjacent squares. For instance, an ogre can attack doublings are equivalent to a tripling. targets up to 10 feet (2 squares) away from it in any direction, even A low obstacle (such as a wall no attack helpless or pinned defenders.

Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to determine if it has cover against you. make a Hide check. 151 COMBAT CHAPTER 8: As with cover, it’s usually not worth differentiating between more degrees of concealment than described above. However, the DM may rule that certain situ- ations provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly. For instance, a light fog might only provide a 10% miss chance, while near-total darkness could provide a 40% miss chance (and a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks). FLANKING When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner. When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters’ centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s space (including corners of those bor- ders), then the opponent is flanked. If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking. Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus. Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent. HELPLESS DEFENDERS A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy. If you are knocked unconscious, you have a an attack of opportunity against you, and your grab automatically 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or 75% if you’re in a military succeeds.

If there are multiple opponents involved in the grapple, you pick one to make the opposed grapple check against. OVERRUN You can attempt an overrun as a standard action taken during your Multiple Grapplers move, but not a charge. (In general, you cannot take a standard Several combatants can be in a single grapple. Up to four combat- action during a move; this is an exception.) With an overrun, you ants can grapple a single opponent in a given round.

You can only overrun an opponent who is one creatures that are one size category larger than you count double, size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.

You may decide to add or omit rolls in the following circumstances. • In cleared-out areas of the dungeon. • While the characters are leaving the dungeon. RANDOM DUNGEON ENCOUNTERS This section provides you with a way to generate dungeon encounters randomly. You can also use the tables in this section simply as lists from which you choose the encounters you want to put in your dungeon. The dungeon encounters tables given here offer a wide range of possibilities, but even so they represent only a small fraction of the creatures (and combinations of creatures) that would make an appropriate encounter at a certain level within the dungeon. By using the rules about Challenge Ratings and Encounter Levels (see page 48), you could design your own encounters to supple- ment or replace the ones on these tables.

In the baseline D\u0026D game world, sewers are much more prevalent than they were in real-world medieval times. To get into the sewers, most characters open a grate (a full-round action) and jump down 10 feet. Sewers are built exactly like dun- geons, except that they’re much more likely to have floors that are slippery or covered with water (treat as a shallow pool, described on page 64). Sewers are also similar to dungeons in terms of crea- tures liable to be encountered therein (see the dungeon encounter tables earlier in this chapter). Some cities were built atop the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes lead to treasures and dangers from a bygone age.

Decide for yourself how much you want to stress the difficulty of playing a monster in civilized areas. The player must decide just how bestial or sophisticated he wants to play the monster character, and how true to the monster arche- type the player wants to cling. He may look to you for guidance, so be prepared ahead of time regarding these issues as well. Do you want the minotaur PC to be gleefully terrorizing the little folk or to be struggling to fit in with humans? Remember that what’s good for PCs is good for NPCs.NPC monsters can have classes, exceptional ability scores, and maxi- mum hit points from their first Hit Die as well. Creating New Races While the creatures in the Monster Manualmake for interesting PC racial choices, that’s not really what they were made for. Most weremade to be opponents for the PCs (which is why they’re monsters). Thus, some DMs may want to create new races made primarily for giving players new options. Creating new races is difficult. In general, use the races in the Player’s Handbookas examples and guides. When in doubt, make the new race similar to one found there. Monsters in the Monster Man- ualweren’t created to be PC races and shouldn’t be used as models for anything other than monsters and NPCs. If you want to create a catlike race with a high Dexterity, look to the elves as an example. They gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity but take a –2 penalty to Consti- tution. For having such a great benefit as heightened Dexterity, the cat people should have a commensurate penalty as well. Here’san important point: Not all the ability scores are equal. For example, the half-orc has a penalty to both Intelligence and Charisma but a bonus only to Strength. That’s because neither a penalty to Intelligence nor a penalty to Charisma by itself is equiv- alent in significance to a bonus to Strength. To return to the cat people example: Dexterity is also a very important ability, and thus a Dexterity bonus could not be balanced by a Charisma penalty alone—some other drawback needs to be added. In general, the following table demonstrates appropriate penal- ties to match equal bonuses. Sometimes the bonus/penalty trade- off doesn’t work both ways. For example, a bonus to Strength is roughly equivalent to a penalty to Constitution, but a bonus to Constitution is not equivalent to a penalty to Strength. together when referring to Table 3–2. For instance, suppose a Ability Score Equivalencies monster with 1 Hit Die and a +1 level adjustment has two levels of rogue. Its ECL is 4 (2 class levels + 1 Hit Die + 1 level adjustment).

A scout’s stealth and trapﬁnding ability make her the natural choice for entering and searching dangerous areas. GAME RULE INFORMATION Scouts have the following game statistics. The most roguelike of the prestige classes in this book, stealthy prestige classes not only provide Hide and Move Silently as class skills, but they emphasize the beneﬁts of moving unseen through enemy territory or making surprise attacks. ANIMAL LORD For an animal lord, a humanoid form is simply an accident of birth. In spirit, he belongs with the wild pack of wolves, the running herd of horses, or the dancing school of ﬁsh. His nearly hairless, two-legged form is a hindrance to being one with his true kind, but it is a hindrance he can overcome. Each animal lord forms a bond with one group of ani - mals. Apelords, bearlords, birdlords, catlords, horselords, sharklords, snakelords, and wolﬂords all exist. Animals in his selected group accept an animal lord as a kindred soul and a leader. They offer him their support, and he watches over them in turn. Individual animal lords approach their calling in different ways. Some are simple defenders of their kind, content to live as part of the natural cycle of predator and prey. Others, believing that nature’s creatures are meant to guard and ultimately improve this world, use their gifts to do good. Still others lead their animal brothers and sisters down a path of selﬁshness or vengeance. Barbarians, rangers, and druids are the most likely characters to adopt this class. Barbarians prefer the more physically powerful options, including apelord, bearlord, and horselord. Rangers gravitate toward the stealthier selections, such as catlord and wolﬂord. Most birdlords are druids with the ability to use wild shape, but druids are equally likely to select any type of animal to bond with. Some scouts, rogues, and even rare monks ﬁnd this path rewarding as well. Among the races, elves and half-elves are the most common examples of animal lords due to their close bond to nature. A character can choose this prestige class more than once but must select a different group of associated animals and start at 1st level each time. Levels of differ - ent animal lord classes do not stack when determining level-based class features. constrictor, giant con - strictor, viper (all). Wolﬂord : dire wolf, wolf. *These creatures are in - cluded even though they are not of the animal type. Detect Animals (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, an animal lord can detect the presence of any animals of his selected group at will, as if using detect animals or plants with a caster level equal to his class level. Wild Empathy (Ex): An animal lord can improve the attitude of an animal. See the druid class feature, page 35 of the Player’s Handbook. If an animal lord has wild empathy from another class, his levels stack for determining the bonus.

The Order of Illumination might be too zealous for some campaigns. Its members are so thor - oughly dedicated to good that they can sometimes stray into intolerance or unfounded accusations. But by leaving the game mechanics unchanged and simply removing the ﬂavor elements of zealotry and suspicion, the shadowbane stalkers become a small group of dedicated cleric/rogues who are extremely skilled at ﬁnding evil monsters. This order probably would consist of clerics from several different churches and would welcome characters who have the right skills. Alternatively, a single shadowbane stalker might run into more than she can handle in the course of an investigation and turn to the PCs for help. In this way, the shadowbane stalkers could become a steady source of adventure leads and staunch allies as the campaign progresses. The Order of Illumination might be too zealous for some campaigns.

In addition to the tricks found on pages 74–75 of the Player’s Handbook , the follow - ing tricks can be taught to an animal with a successful Handle Animal check (DCs noted below). Some tricks require that the animal already know an existing trick. Assist Attack (DC 20): The animal aids your attack or that of another creature as a standard action. You must desig - nate both the recipient of the aid and a speciﬁc opponent when commanding the animal to perform the task. The animal uses the aid another combat action (see page 154 of the Player’s Handbook ), attempting to grant a bonus on the recipient’s next attack roll against the designated opponent. It also ﬂanks the designated opponent, if it can do so without provoking attacks of opportunity. An animal must know the attack trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 74) before it can learn this trick. Assist Defend (DC 20): The animal aids your defense or that of another creature as a standard action. You must designate both the recipient of the aid and a speciﬁc opponent when commanding the animal to perform the task. The animal uses the aid another combat action, attempting to grant a bonus on the recipient’s AC against the designated opponent’s next attack. An animal must know the defend trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 75) before it can learn this trick. Assist Track (DC 20): The animal aids your attempt to track. The animal must be present as you attempt a Survival check to track another creature; if the animal succeeds on a DC 10 Survival check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Survival check made to track. An animal must have the scent ability and know the track trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 75) before it can learn this trick. Hold (DC 20): The animal initiates a grapple attack and attempts to hold a designated enemy in its arms, claws, or teeth. An animal with the improved grab ability uses that ability in the attempt; otherwise, the attack provokes attacks of opportunity. An animal must know the attack trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 74) before it can learn this trick. Home (DC 20): The animal returns to the location where it was trained to perform this trick, traveling overland as required. Hunt (DC 15): The animal attempts to hunt and forage for food for you using its Survival skill. See page 83 of the Player’s Handbook for details on how to use Survival to hunt and forage for food. While any animal automati - cally knows how to hunt and forage for its own needs, this trick causes it to return with food rather than simply eating its ﬁll of what it ﬁnds. Stalk (DC 20): The animal follows a designated target, doing its best to remain undetected, until the target is wounded or resting, and then attacks. An animal must know the attack trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 74) before it can learn this trick. Steal (DC 20): The animal grabs an object in the posses - sion of a target creature, wrests it away, and brings it to you. If multiple objects are available, the animal attempts to steal a random one. An animal must know the fetch trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 75) before it can learn this trick. Subdue (DC 20): The animal attacks a designated target creature to deal nonlethal damage, taking a –4 penalty on its attack roll. The animal stops its attack when the target creature lapses into unconsciousness. An animal must know the attack trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 74) before it can learn this trick. Warn (DC 20): The animal reacts to new creatures coming near, even without any command being given, regardless of whether the animal sees the newcomer, or hears it, or detects the creature with scent. The exact warning sound given (hiss, growl, squawk, bark) varies depending on animal type and the training; this sound is chosen at the time of training and cannot be changed. If the newcomer does not stop after this warning, the animal attacks. As part of the training, the animal can be trained to ignore speciﬁc creatures (such as the trainer’s allies). An animal must know the guard trick ( Player’s Handbook, page 75) before it can learn this trick. Making a Heal check to determine the cause of a creature’s death takes 10 minutes. The creature can learn three more tricks than normal. This feat can be taken multiple times.

You can also use this option to sneak up on someone from a hiding place. For every 5 feet of open space between you and the target, you take a –5 penalty on your Hide check. If your Hide check succeeds, your target doesn’t notice you until you attack or make some other attention-grabbing action. Such a target is treated as being ﬂat-footed with respect to you. For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue could attempt to dash across a 5-foot-wide doorway without revealing her presence to the orcs inside. Even though the open doorway provides no cover or concealment, she can attempt a Hide check as normal, opposed by the orcs’ Spot checks. She takes a –5 penalty on her check because of the distance involved. If she moved at more than half her speed, she would take an additional –5 or –10 penalty on the check depending on how fast she moved (see above). Sense Motive 4 ranks, base attack bonus +5. Beneﬁt: As a free action, you can use Sense Motive to assess the challenge presented by a single opponent in relationship to your own level/Hit Dice (see the assess opponent option under the Sense Motive skill, page 102). You gain a +4 bonus on such checks and narrow the result to a single category. In addition, whenever you make a melee attack against a creature that you made a melee attack against during the previous round, you gain a +1 insight bonus on your melee attack rolls against that creature.

A typical drum consists of skin, parchment, or some similar material stretched tightly over the opening of a hollow wooden cylinder or pot. This covered opening is called the drumhead. Striking the drumhead with sticks, mallets, or even hands produces the sound. Some drums have only one drumhead; others have two or more. Drums exist in large varieties (such as kettle drums) as well as smaller varieties (such as bongo drums or the double-ended tabor). Drums are popular with almost every race and culture for their ability to stir the emotions, establish a back - ground beat for dancing, and provide counterpoint for a melody produced by some other instrument. Dwarves, orcs, and other races that favor underground living particularly enjoy the echoing power of drums. Smaller races, such as goblins and halﬂings, like bongo drums for their portability. The rare creatures that do not appreci - ate drum-playing include celestials, who consider drum rhythms primitive, and elves, who ﬁnd them vaguely disturbing and annoying (a prejudice reinforced, perhaps, by the enthusiasm with which many of their enemies embrace them).

A herd of goats keeps the groundcover cropped fairly close. The animals belong to a tribe ofcentaurs that helps to defend the college when neces-sary. Visitors to the college might spot a few centaursand goats roaming the grounds during daylight hours. DDCentaurs (5-8): hp 26 each; see Monster Manual, page 32. At almost any hour, a few students are busily studying the tapestries in this chamber. The talethey illustrate is the subject of many popular poems andsongs, and a bard who has studied them gains some newinsights into those works. Also, some of the Fochlucanmasters find that the tapestries serve as an excellenttextbook for teaching a variety of subjects, from humanfolklore to observation and memory. Consequently,their students spend a great of time in here trying totake in all the details. A door warden—typically a junior member of the college staff—is posted in this chamber at all hours togreet visitors and generally keep an eye on the situation. DDStudents (0-5): Male or female bard 1 to bard 6; see the sample NPC statistics in Chapter 4 of theDungeon Master’s Guide. DDWarden (1): Almost any character might be on duty here, but the warden usually is a Fochlucan lyrist.Use the statistics for Tyrea Neylis on pages 48-49 ofComplete Adventurer for a warden. One Fochlucan has made the gazebo her permanent quarters. Elibroviel the pixie grew upnear the college and spent her youth bedeviling itsstudents and masters. Having absorbed much of theirknowledge over the years, she eventually decided tobecome an adventurer. These days, she functions as thecollege’s unofficial sergeant-at-arms and its chief liaisonto the sylvan creatures living near Loch Firrnen. The Fochlucan masters have wide interests and many friends, so a guest house may hostalmost any kind of visitor. Lillends visit the collegeoften because they’re drawn to the tapestries in thefront hall and the delightful music that the bardsproduce. Thus, a few lillends generally occupy one ortwo of the guest houses at any given time. The majorityof the houses, however, are empty unless a major eventis occurring at the college. DDLillends (2-4): hp 45 each, see Monster Manual, page 168. The kitchen is empty in the middle of the night. At all other times, three or four servants are at workhere, either preparing a meal or cleaning up after one. Cooks (3–4): Male or female human or half-elf commoner 2; hp 7. One of the college librarians and a handful of students are here at all hours. (See theCreatures section of the Front Hall description fordetails.) Two librarians are present at the college at anygiven time, and the Fochlucans count nearly a dozenamong their members. All are familiar with the collec-tion and with books in general. The absent librariansspend much of their time acquiring or writing newbooks for the collection. Loch Firrnen (EL 5, 6, 7, or 8) The clear water of the loch teems with fish. The shore-line is rather marshy, and the loch remains fairly shal-low (about 4 feet deep) for about a hundred yards outfrom it. Clumps of cattails grow in profusion in theshallow portions. The lake is more than 8 miles wide,however, and the water is more than 300 feet deep atvarious spots around its midpoint. The loch is home to a tribe of nixes, and like the local centaurs, these creatures have agreed tohelp defend the college. To that end, a band of nixieslurks under the water about 100 yards from the end ofthe dock at all times, keeping an eye on the college. DDNixies (6-11): hp 3 each; see Monster Manual, page 235. During the day, this room is empty because the residents are working elsewhere in the collegeor on the grounds. At night, they are here sleeping. Servants (0-6): Male or female human or half-elf commoner 1; hp 3. SECOND FLOOR This floor is generally off limits to visitors.Unauthorized folks who wander up here are first askednicely to leave, then forcibly ejected if necessary. Master’s Room (EL 12) Each of these three chambers contains two beds withcurtained canopies, a divan, a worktable and writingdesk, two wardrobes, two chests of drawers, a bookcase,and two trunks. The typical bookcase holds a fewvolumes borrowed from the library, plus several booksthat belong to the current residents. An everburning torch augments the light from the windows, and a color- ful rug similar to the one in the library covers the floor. These rooms are reserved for Fochlucans who are currently pursuing projects at thecollege—usually the two librarians and wardens, plusanyone who currently has students working in thebuilding. Typically, each room has one or two occu-pants, and each master has a key to her own room. The room could house anywhere from no students to more than a dozen at any given time. Students (0-13): Male and female bard 1 to bard 6; use the sample NPC statistics in Chapter 4 of theDungeon Master’s Guide. The current yew master in residence is a half-elf named Noelin, who is very much a typicalmember of the Yew Circle. He is known for his eclecticskills, wide interests, and detached manner. Noelin is quick to investigate any disturbance within the building, and he doesn’t hesitateto attack visitors who become violent.

Ferrug’s former demonic lord was slain as she lay senseless while astrally traveling to the Material Plane to corrupt mortal hearts. Since then, Ferrug has hosted countless armies of demons interested in gathering workable iron to build other iron strongholds. Because the demons highly value iron, devil strike forces often attack the Lakes of Molten Iron, so Ferrug currently serves as a command center for a force of demons charged by Demogorgon to protect the lakes. Azzagrat Azzagrat is the realm of Graz’zt, an Abyssal lord. Azzagrat stretches over three layers, the 45th, 46th, and 47th. Because all three layers are ruled by the same Abyssal lord, they share many traits and have many portals con- necting them. One of the common threads among the three layers is the River of Salt, a sparkling crystalline mass of liquid salt crystal. Needless to say, submersion in the river is deadly. Other features include portals between the three layers that appear as groves of viper trees and ovens of green fire. But given Graz’zt’s cruel sense of humor, some green-fire ovens are simply full of fire and don’t contain portals at all. 101 PLANES THE OUTER CHAPTER 7: pqs RANDOM ABYSSAL LAYERS What if your characters wind up being sent to the Abyss as a result of an adventure gone wrong?

It is covered in dark blue-green scales. It has two long tentacles in place of arms and a long, forked tail. Demogorgon’s mortal servants sometimes call forth his aspect to receive living sacrifices of sentient beings. Aspects of Demogor- gon are infamous for using these opportunities to take more than his followers bargain for. An aspect of Demogorgon, like other tanar’ri, can speak tele- pathically to any creature within 100 feet that has a language. It also speaks Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic. Combat An aspect of Demogorgon is more willing to engage in combat than Demogorgon himself, mostly because the aspect doesn’t have underlings at its beck and call to do the fighting for it.

They are equally happy to come to the Material Plane as mercenaries or regular soldiers in the hire of an evil lord. On their native plane, the three varieties of shadow beast do not war against one another, but neither will they serve in the same company of soldiers. They do sometimes work together when serving on the Material Plane; in particular, the khumats seem able to cooperate with either of the other two varieties.

BATTLE GRID Start with a battle grid, a map overlaid with 1-inch squares. Two published battle grids are available: in the D\u0026D Miniatures Entry Pack(22 inches by 34 inches) and the DUNGEONMASTER’s Guide (19 inches by 28 inches). Any size will do, though, depending on how big a skirmish you want. The edges of the battle grid are impassable walls. The only way off is through the exit squares. These are either the five squares in a corner (marked on the Entry Packbattle grid) or three squares along a side (for players not starting in a corner). Seating Arrange players around the battle grid according to how many are involved. An out of command creature can rush toward the nearest enemy it can see if it can reach that enemy during its 87 RULES SKIRMISH CHAPTER 5: 620_96582_MinisHndbk.qxd 8/19/03 10:05 AM Page 87 SSwwoorrdd ooff HHeeiirroonneeoouuss 33 CCoommmmaanndd RRaannggee 11 22 AA ccoommmmaannddeerr ccaann ccoommmmaanndd aalllliieess tthhaatt 44 iitt ccaann sseeee oorr tthhaatt aarree wwiitthhiinn 66 ssqquuaarreess.. 44 TThhee SSwwoorrdd ooff HHeeiirroonneeoouuss ccaann ccoommmmaanndd tthhee DDwwaarrff AAxxeeffiigghhtteerr oorr tthhee MMaaannn---aaattt---AAArrrmmmsss,,, 55 bbuutt nnoott tthhee HHaallfflliinngg VVeetteerraann oorr tthhee SSuunn SSoouull IInniittiiaattee.. 55,, 66 66 DDwwaarrff AAxxeeffiigghhtteerr HHaallfflliinngg VVeetteerraann lliinnee ooff ssiigghhtt bblloocckkeedd lliinnee ooff ssiigghhtt OOKK SSuunn SSoouull IInniittiiaattee MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss WWaallllss aanndd DDiissttaannccee WWhheenn ddeetteerrmmiinniinngg ddiissttaannccee ffoorr ccoommmmaanndd,, ccoouunntt aarroouunndd wwaallllss,, nnoott tthhrroouugghh tthheemm..

Becoming Under or Out of Command If a creature starts its turn under command, it moves as though under command for its entire turn, even if it winds up moving out of command during its turn. Conversely, a creature that starts its turn out of command moves as though out of command for its entire turn, even if it becomes under command during its turn. However, a creature is subject to a commander’s Commander Effect whenever it is within 6 squares of that commander, whether or not it started its turn under command. WHEN COMMANDERS CAN’T COMMAND Only active commanders can put other creatures under com- mand. A commander who is routing, stunned, confused, or helpless can’t put any creature under command, not even itself. Its Commander Effect also does not function under these circumstances. MOVEMENT During its turn, a creature can move up to its speed and attack, or attack and then move up to its speed. It can also decide not to attack and instead take a second move, moving up to double speed. A creature that is out of command has its speed reduced to 2 unless it rushes the nearest enemy during that turn (see Command and Movement, above). A creature can move through a space occu- pied by an ally, but it can’t end its move in an occupied square, and it can’t charge through that square, either. A creature cannot move through a space occupied by an enemy. Some attacks deal extra damage, shown by a when one is available. “+” sign. For example, the Large Fire Elemental’s melee attack deals “10 + 5 fire.” Extra damage is not doubled on a critical hit.

(The battle plays faster if units don’t have facing.) them, squad-level battles work better with a lower point cost. Try 300 If the unit isn’t routing and engages one or more enemy units, it must make all melee attacks it’s allowed against those units. It also must shift as much as it is able (up to 1 inch) to be in contact with the maximum number of enemy creatures. (See Movement, below, for detailed rules on shifting.) If the unit isn’t routing and can’t attack an enemy unit from its current location, it must stand. However, a standing unit can adjust its position slightly. A formed unit may move forward up to 1 inch, pivot freely, or move backward up to 1/2 inch. An unformed unit may move up to 1 inch in any direction. A stand- ing unit may not attack, even if this movement puts it in a loca- tion where normally it could attack. Commanders and Actions Commanders never require command points, not even their own, to act. They are never forced to take compulsory actions. MOVEMENT Armies can’t clash until they move close enough to each other to unleash their attacks. A unit can move and then attack, attack and then move, or move at double speed if it takes no other actions (or if it charges). All intended moves can be premeasured. You don’t have to esti- mate distances before deciding what actions to take. FORMED UNIT MOVEMENT A formed unit moves straight ahead unless it takes a special move option: drift, pivot, or back up. UNFORMED UNIT MOVEMENT Unformed units have no facing and so can move in any direction. Drift Thus, they do not need to drift or back up as a special maneuver. Any time a formed unit moves straight ahead more than its speed (such as by making a double move or a charge), it can Pivot drift, ending its move up to 1 inch to the left or right of the An unformed unit can pivot around any point.

This follows the normal rules for melee contact (see Attacks and Damage, below), but if the enemy unit is formed, only one rank of creatures in it can attack. Each creature that does so can make only a single attack roll as part of the attack of opportunity. If the moving unit converges, this attack happens after the pivot. A moving unit avoids this attack if it has a Melee Reach rating at least as high as that of the defending unit. Unlike in the skirmish rules, a unit with Melee Reach does not fight at a distance. Even if both units have Melee Reach, the moving unit converges to bring its edge flush against the other’s edge. CHARGE Any unit may charge the nearest enemy unit to cover more ground and attack at an advantage. Movement To charge, a unit moves toward the nearest enemy unit it can see. If two or more enemy units are equally near, the attacking unit’s player chooses which one to charge. A charging unit can move up to double speed and must be able to move at least 2 inches before making its attack. A charging unit must move in a straight line (although it can drift). If any line traced between the unit’s starting and ending positions passes through terrain that slows or prevents move- ment, or terrain that contains a unit (even a friendly one or a lone creature), the charge is not allowed. When the charging unit engages the enemy unit, it makes a single set of melee melee attack rolls (also known as a mass Third, the moving unit makes a melee attack (if the movement strike) with a +2 bonus. A unit with multiple melee attacks can was part of a charge, or if the unit has moved its speed or less). use only one of these on a charge.

(If the units are already edge to edge, the moving unit obviously doesn’t have to converge.) The converging unit must pivot in one direction or the other, depending on which edge is closer to the enemy unit. If two edges are equally close, the acting player chooses. Converging doesn’t count as part of a unit’s movement. Normally a formed unit can only pivot forward around a front corner. These restrictions don’t apply to converging. (A formed unit that is converging pivots around the point of contact.) A unit that starts its turn engaging an enemy unit at an angle must either converge or disengage (see below). However, it cannot converge if doing so would cause it to disengage from another enemy unit. Melee Attack If the converging unit has completed a charge or has moved its speed or less, it can now make a single melee attack against the enemy unit. (If creatures in the converging unit have multiple melee attacks, they can make only one set of melee attack rolls.) Engaging an Enemy with Melee Reach If a unit moves to engage an enemy unit that has the Melee Reach special ability, the enemy unit can immediately make an 136 attack of opportunity against it before the moving unit can :6 RETPAHC ELTTAB SSAM SELUR nippaT .S yb .sullI 620_96582_MinisHndbk.qxd 8/19/03 12:08 PM Page 136 Man-at-Arms CChhaarrggiinngg MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss uunniitt OOrrcc WWaarrrriioorr uunniitt 11 iinncchh WWhheenn aa ffoorrmmeedd uunniitt mmoovveess ffoorrwwaarrdd mmoorree tthhaann iittss ssppeeeedd,, iitt mmaayy ddrriifftt 11 iinncchh ttoo tthhee lleefftt oorr rriigghhtt aatt aannyy ppooiinntt iinn tthhee mmoovvee..

MELEE CONTACT When hostile units engage each other, use the rules for melee contact to determine how many creatures in each unit can attack. Frontage Even though creatures in a unit are on round bases, they are con- sidered to be in melee contact with enemy creatures whose frontage touches their own. A creature’s frontage is the portion of its unit’s edge that corresponds to the width of the miniature’s base. Lining Up Units (Offset) When hostile units engage each other, line them up so that their creatures’ frontages overlap, never directly opposite one another. This allows melee contact between the greatest number of indi- vidual creatures. If the frontages of one unit line up exactly with those of the other, then the unit that moved into position lines up slightly to one side or the other to offset the frontages. Formed Units A formed unit can make a number of attack rolls equal to the number of its creatures in melee contact with the enemy unit, plus one for each adjacent creature in the same rank as those creatures (or in the same file, if the attack is against the unit’s side). There may be a creature on one or both sides of a group of crea- tures in melee contact, so the unit may be able to make one or two more attacks than the number of creatures in actual contact. See the accompanying diagram for an example. If a formed unit consists of Small or Medium creatures with Melee Reach 2 or better, it can make additional melee attack rolls against enemies to its front. The second rank of creatures can attack as if they were in the front rank, determining melee contact in the same way. Large units having Melee Reach 3 or better also get this benefit. (In the best case, Melee Reach allows a formed unit to make twice as many attack rolls as normal.) Melee Reach does not allow units to make more melee attack rolls when attacking to a side or to the rear. Unformed Units An unformed unit has empty space between any two creatures. Unformed units, therefore, get fewer attack rolls in melee because they can’t bring as much force to bear against the enemy. Since no two creatures in an unformed unit are really adjacent, a creature can attack only if it or the adjacent empty space is in melee contact. (Treat the empty space as having a frontage equal to its width.) Unformed units, because of their loose order, cannot make extra melee attack rolls by using the Melee Reach ability. Engaged with Multiple Units A unit attacks all enemy units that it engages. A given creature, 138 however, can contribute to attacks against only one enemy unit. :6 RETPAHC ELTTAB SSAM SELUR 620_96582_MinisHndbk.qxd 8/19/03 12:09 PM Page 138 MMeelleeee CCoonnttaacctt ((22)) MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss uunniitt aattttaacckk 22 –– 22 AACC –– OOrrcc WWaarrrriioorr uunniitt aattttaacckk ++22 ++22 AACC MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss UUnniitt:: TThhee uunniitt ccaann aattttaacckk wwiitthh oonnllyy ttwwoo ccrreeaattuurreess (( bbootthh ccoonnssiiddeerreedd ttoo bbee iinn mmeelleeee ccoonnttaacctt))..

If a creature in a formed unit is in melee contact with one enemy unit and is adjacent to a creature in melee contact with another enemy unit, it can’t contribute to attacks against the second unit. If a creature is in melee contact with two enemy units, it can contribute to attacks against either one but not against both. If it is adjacent to creatures that are in contact with two different units, it can contribute to attacks against either one but not against both. (When the attacking creatures are in an unformed unit, treat the adjacent empty spaces in the unit as adjacent creatures for purposes of this rule.) Before you make melee attack rolls against an enemy unit, you commit to which creatures are contributing to that attack. You can’t roll first and then decide to add other creatures to the attack. Shifting A unit that starts its turn engaged by an enemy unit can shift to one side to put more of its edge in melee contact with the enemy unit. The distance of this shift is equal to the width of the base of one of the creatures in the unit. A shift does not count as movement. A unit of creatures with multiple melee attacks can make all of its attacks after shifting. A unit can’t shift if doing so doesn’t increase the length of the edge that’s in melee contact with the enemy. A unit also can’t shift when doing so would take it out of contact with a second enemy unit or reduce the length of the edge that’s in melee contact with any enemy unit. Pivoting around a Point of Contact An unformed unit can pivot around a point of contact with an enemy unit if doing so brings more creatures into contact with Units of Differing Size the enemy unit. It can’t perform this pivot if it would be disen- Often a unit made up of smaller creatures has more of them in gaging from other units by doing so. This movement counts nor- melee contact than an opposing unit with bigger creatures has. mally against the unit’s movement in a round. For instance, when a formed unit of Small creatures (six per rank) is lined up front to front with a formed unit of Large crea- tures (three per rank), all six Small creatures are in contact with the three Large creatures. All six Small creatures contribute to the melee attack, making six attack rolls, while the three Large creatures respond with three attack rolls. Narrow Gaps between Units Sometimes terrain or another unit prevents a unit from con- verging completely with an enemy that it engages. In this case, creatures along the nearer edge are considered to be in melee contact if they’re within 1 inch of the enemy unit. (Walls, other creatures, and other obstacles that would prevent a creature from moving up to the enemy prevent this contact.) GENERAL MELEE RULES All units abide by these rules for melee combat, whether formed or unformed. Multiple Melee Attacks Some creatures have multiple melee attacks, indicated on the stat card by two or more numbers separated by a slash (such as +7/+2). A unit of such creatures first makes a mass strike using the number preceding the slash. After the effects of damage are applied (including any morale saves by the defending unit), a unit may make another mass strike using the number following the slash, and so on for each attack available. All of the attacks made by a creature in the unit must be made against the unit the creature attacked during the first mass strike. If a unit with multiple melee attacks moves at all in its turn, it 139 can make a mass strike only once (using the number preceding RULES MASS BATTLE CHAPTER 6: 620_96582_MinisHndbk.qxd 8/19/03 12:10 PM Page 139 SShhiiffttiinngg MMaaannn---aaattt---AAArrrmmmsss uuunnniiittt OOrrcc WWaarrrriioorr uunniitt 11 iinncchh MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss uunniitt OOrrcc WWaarrrriioorr uunniitt TThhee MMaann--aatt--AArrmmss uunniitt bbeeggiinnss iittss ttuurrnn aallrreeaaddyy eennggaaggeedd wwiitthh tthhee OOrrcc WWaarrrriioorr uunniitt..
