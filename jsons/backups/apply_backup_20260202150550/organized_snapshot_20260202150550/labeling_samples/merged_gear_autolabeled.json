        "merged_description":  "REARING A DRAGON Being an adoptive parent to a dragon is no easy task. Even good-aligned dragons have a sense of superiority and an innate yearning for freedom. Most dragons instinctively deferto older dragons of the same kind, but they tend to regard other creatures with some disdain. Older and wiser dragons eventually learn to respect non- dragons for their abilities and accomplishments, but a newly hatched wyrmling tends to regard a nondragon foster parent as a captor—or at best as a well-meaning fool. Still, it is possiblefor a nondragon character to forge a bond with a newly hatched wyrmling. Accomplishing this requires the use of Diplomacy or Intimidate as well as (eventually) the Handle Animal skill. A character seeking to rear a newly hatched wyrmling must begin with a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to persuade the dragon to accept the character’s guidance; 5 or more ranks of Knowledge (arcana) gives the character a +2 bonus on thecheck. The character’s Diplomacy or Intimidate check is opposed by a Sense Motive check by the dragon. The dragon has a +15 racial bonus on its check. Certain other conditions,such as those mentioned on the table below, can further modify the wyrmling’s Sense Motive check. Condition ModifierCharacter tended the dragon’s egg while –2 it was incubating Character was present at the dragon’s hatching –5 Each component of dragon’s alignment –5 in common with the character’s1 1 Alignment components are chaos, evil, good, law, and neutral. This opposed check is rolled secretly by the DM, so that theplayer of the character does not immediately know the resultof the check. If the wyrmling wins the opposed check, it regards the character as a captor and attempts to gain its free-dom any way it can. (Most dragons, even newly hatched wyrm- lings, are smart enough to forego an immediate attack on a more powerful being, and will wait for the right opportunity toescape.) No attempt by this character to rear this dragon can succeed. This opposed check cannot be retried. If the character wins this opposed check, he or she can attempt to rear the dragon. The process takes 5 years, but once the rear- ing period begins, the character need only devote one day a week to the dragon’s training. Throughout the rearing period, however,the dragon must be fed and housed at a cost of 10 gp per day. When the rearing period has run its course, the character attempts a Handle Animal check (DC 20 + the dragon’s Hit Dice at the very young stage). Only one check is made, rolledsecretly by the DM. A failed check cannot be retried. If the char- acter’s Handle Animal check fails, the dragon is not success- fully reared and seeks to leave, as noted above. If the checksucceeds, the character can begin to train the dragon to perform tasks (the most common of which is serving as a mount; see Dragons as Mounts, page 136, and the HandleAnimal skill, page 74 of the Player’s Handbook ). For many characters, the ultimate purpose of rearing a dragon is to make it available to the character as a cohort. Torear a dragon for this reason, the character must have takenthe Leadership feat (see page 106 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ) by the time the rearing period expires, and must have a sufficiently high Leadership score to attract the dragon as acohort at that time (using the dragon’s Hit Dice at the very young stage as its cohort level). Also, the dragon’s alignment must not be opposed to the character’s alignment on eitherthe law-vs.-chaos or good-vs.-evil axis (for example, a lawful good character cannot attempt to rear a chaotic evil wyrmling). For more information, see Dragons as Cohorts, page 138. pqqqqrspqqqqrs14 CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS undergoes little obvious physical change. By this stage of life, a dragon is truly a force to be reckoned with—and it knows it. Mature adults display a degree of self-confidence that younger dragons lack. Mature adults seldom seek out dangerjust to prove themselves (except, perhaps, against other drag-ons). Instead, they act with purpose and confidence, oftenlaunching schemes that take years to complete. Because of a mature adult’s power, wealth, and age, it seldom remains unnoticed in the larger world. Its name becomesknown, at least among other dragons, and it often becomes thetarget of rival dragons or adventurers. One of a mature adult’sfirst orders of business is to review and improve the defensesin its lair. Often, the dragon relocates as a matter of prudence.The dragon never chooses its new lair hastily, and usuallyincludes in its plans some scheme to secure more treasure.Bards’ tales of dragons destroying kingdoms and seizing theirtreasuries often have their roots in true accounts of what hap-pens when a mature adult dragon is on the move. OLD (AGE 401-600 YEARS) By the time most dragons reach this age, their physicalgrowth stops, though they become even more hardy, andtheir minds and magical powers continue to expand withthe passing centuries. Old dragons usually begin to show some outward signs of aging: Their scales begin to chip and crack at the edges andalso to darken and lose their luster (though some metallicdragons actually take on a burnished appearance), and theirises in their eyes begin to fade, so that their eyes begin toresemble featureless orbs. Most old dragons continue to hone the patient cunning they began to develop as mature adults. Though quick todefend what they regard as their own, they seldom rush intoanything, preferring instead to plumb the possibilities inany situation before acting. VERY OLD (AGE 601-800 YEARS) After passing the six-century mark, a dragon becomes evenmore resistant to physical punishment. It begins master-ing potent spells and magical abilities. This is the last stageof life in which female dragons remain fertile, and mostfemales attempt to raise at least two clutches of eggs beforetheir reproductive period runs out.ANCIENT (AGE 801-1,000 YEARS) By this stage, female dragons have reached the end of theirreproductive years. Many females compensate by mentor-ing younger dragons of the species, as do many males.Ancient dragons have little to fear from much younger drag-ons that have not yet reached adulthood, and they havemuch wisdom and experience to pass on. Most dragons at this age have minds to match the best and brightest humans, and they can tap into vast stores ofknowledge, both practical and esoteric. WYRM (AGE 1,001-1,200 YEARS) Surviving for more than a thousand years is a grand accom-plishment, even for dragons, and this stage is a great mile stone in dragon life. Even among rival dragons, a wyrm com-mands at least grudging respect. Male dragons at this stageare reaching the end of their reproductive years, but theirexalted status among dragons practically guarantees themmates. Younger females often establish territories adjacentto a male wyrm for mating, for protection, and to make iteasy for the offspring to gain the wyrm as a mentor. GREAT WYRM (AGE 1,201+ YEARS) When a dragon passes the twelve-century mark, its mentaland physical development is finally at an end, and the dragonis at the peak of its physical, mental, and magical powers. THE TWILIGHT AND DEATH Exactly how long a dragon can live after reaching the greatwyrm stage is a matter of some debate (some scholars con-tend that a dragon lives forever). Unfortunately, dragonsthemselves are little help in this matter. They keep no birthrecords and are apt to exaggerate their ages. The half-elf sages Guillaume and Cirjon de Cheirdon made a study of dragon ages by carefully noting when cer-tain famous (and infamous) dragons reached their wyrm cel-ebrations and then tracking their ages from there. Somelater scholars suspect that Guillaume and Cirjon were silverdragons using half-elf guise, and that the speculations theypublished were in fact field notes. In any case, the pair even-tually vanished, and their final resting places are not known.Perhaps they died in a dragon attack, or perhaps they arewith us still, in other guises. DRAGON GRAVEYARDS A dragon graveyard presents a macabre landscape of blasted earth littered with ossified dragon bones and fresher dragon remains. Every dragon graveyard has at least one ghostly guardian, charged with protecting the place. The graveyard’s guardian is exactly like a ghostly dragon (see page 161) of a great wyrmdragon, usually a gold dragon or other dragon of lawful align- ment. The guardian exists only to guard the graveyard, not to recover a lost hoard. The guardian cannot be put to rest byoffering it treasure. If it is defeated in combat, the guardian re- forms in 1 day. Other ghostly dragons might be present also. These addi- tional spirits are normal ghostly dragons. Supernatural hazards abound in a dragon graveyard. Periodic storms of elemental energy rage through area. These storms are similar to fire storm spells cast by 20th-level charac- ters (Reflex DC 23 half), except that they can be composed of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, and they cover the whole grave- yard. They typically strike every 1d4 hours, but the frequencycan vary widely. Dragon graveyards also contain areas in which the fabric of the cosmos is weakened. These unstable areas can be anywherefrom 5 feet to 50 feet across. Every 1d4 hours, such an area is equally likely to expel a horde of elementals (treat as an elemen- tal swarm spell cast by a 20th-level character) or draw everything within the unstable area into a vortex leading to an elementalplane. This vortex lasts for 1d4 minutes. Creatures that touch or enter the unstable area during the period of the disturbance are whisked to an elemental plane. A weak spot always has a lingering aura of conjuration magic (aura strength is overwhelming when it is active). A dragon graveyard also has an ever-changing population of dragon skeletons and dragon zombies (see pages 192 and 197) that have become animated by the supernaturalforces in the graveyard. These creatures attack any living creature they meet, except for dragons that have come tothe graveyard to die. The legends about treasure in dragon graveyards are true. A dragon graveyard typically contains triple standard treasure forthe guardian’s Challenge Rating. Though ghostly dragons normally do not have any treasure, a dragon graveyard accu- mulates bits and pieces of treasure that departing dragonshave left behind and equipment from would-be looters whoweren’t up to the challenge. Yes (object) An invisible ray projects from your fingers. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. Thetarget, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field. If this spell is used against a creature, the target can’t cast spells or can’t use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor dosuch abilities have any effect on the creature. However, thecreature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls)or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it can’tcast the spells required. If this spell is usewd against an object, that object’s magi- cal powers are suppressed—including any spells previ-ously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as anyspells or magical effects targeted on the object during theantimagic ray ’s duration. Remember that an object struck by the ray only receives a saving throw if it is attended or if it isa magic item. An unattended item, even if currently underthe effect of a spell (such as a torch with continual flame cast upon it), receives no save. The spell doesn’t affect any objects other than the target itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contactwith the target. For instance, if a creature is the target, its equipment remains unaffected. Yes (harmless) This abjuration grants a creature complete protection against damage from whichever one of five energy types you select:acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell protects therecipient’s equipment as well. Energy immunity absorbs only damage. The recipient could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid(since drowning results from a lack of oxygen), being deaf-ened by a sonic attack, or becoming encased in ice. The effect of this spell does not stack with similar effects, such as resist energy and protection from energy, that protect against the same energy type. If a character is warded withenergy immunity (fire) and is also receiving resistance to fire from one or more of the other spells, the energy immunity makes the other spells irrelevant. However, it is possible tobe simultaneously under the effect of energy immunity (fire) and resist energy (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy . Entice Gift Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]Level: Greed 2, Sor/Wiz 2 True dragons possess blindsense, which threatens to remove a valuable tool from the DM’s arsenal,because invisible foes aren’t nearly as dire a threat to thepartty anymore. Remember, though, that blindsense isn’tthe same thing as a true seeing effect—it merely allows thedragon to detect the presence of creatures within its blind-sense range. The dragon can’t automatically see through anillusion (though one without auditory and olfactory elementsprobably won’t work), and disguises work perfectly well.Incorporeal, gaseous, and ethereal creatures also can give adragon plenty of problems. A deafened dragon, or one insideasilence effect, also can’t use its blindsense to full effect.",

Thespian\u0027s Mask: Sometimes called a \"performer\u0027s face\" or \"actor\u0027s visage,\" each of these fascinating masks is a unique and intricate work of art. Fashioned by the greatest elven artists of the modern age, no two thespian\u0027s masks are alike. A thespian\u0027s mask is carved from the finest ivory and then painted to resemble the face of a humanoid creature. Depending on the whim of the artisan creating it, a thespian\u0027s mask might, for example, bear a fearsome orc warrior\u0027s visage, the fair skin of an elven maiden, or the face of an old human sage. When worn, the mask merges with its owner\u0027s face, changing his features to match those of the humanoid creature depicted upon it. The change affects the wearer as the spell disguise self, but it only changes the wearer\u0027s appearance to match that of the face the mask was crafted to depict. For example, a thespian mask in the form of a fair-skinned elven maiden would disguise its wearer—including clothing and equipment—as an elven maiden and nothing else.

Jarren Skein. The remorhazes usually rest about 10 feet under the surface, with one on either side of the crevasse. By design or by chance, the two creatures\u0027 tremorsense abilities cover the whole length of the crevasse. When one remorhaz notes prey nearby, it burrows up to attack with surprise while its mate moves into the crevasse, then burrows up to attack as well. It takes the mate 2-3 rounds to join the fight. If either remorhaz swallows someone whole, it immediately retreats under the snow, which collapses to fill the tunnel the creature has left behind. Fortunately, the blockage is fairly easy to clear. A Small or larger character can clear it away with a full-round action, revealing a slippery tunnel about 8 feet wide. A single Tiny or smaller creature needs an extra full-round action to clear the blockage for every size category below Small. Two or more creatures who cooperate to clear blockage are treated as a single creature of the next size category larger. For example, two Tiny creatures working together can clear the blockage with one full-round action. Movement inside the tunnel is hampered for creatures that do not have burrowing speeds. Ice Caves (EL 12) Several, long, rambling ice caves riddle the glacier\u0027s lower end. The interconnected caves create almost a mile of twisting corridors and chambers. Some of the passageways lead to crevasses higher up in the glacier. The caves have slippery floors that hamper movement and ceilings between 5 and 12 feet high. Walls inside the caves have a Climb DC of 18. Anytime except winter, pools of meltwater form in the cave, then freeze again into crystal clear ice. Many of these pools have only a thin crust of ice, with 1 or 2 feet of freezing water beneath. The crust can support only 20 pounds. A character approaching a pool at normal pace is entitled to a DC 15 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in. If someone runs or charges in the caves (difficult because of the hampered movement), the character doesn\u0027t have a chance to detect the pool before stepping in. The freezing water in the pool deals 1d3 points of temporary cold damage. The water also soaks the character\u0027s footgear, and a character with wet feet takes a -4 penalty on all checks and saves to resist the effects of environmental cold, such as the hourly save a character must make to avoid the effects of cold or severe cold on the glacier. Throughout the caves, visitors find sculpted walls, floors, and ice columns of almost unearthly beauty. Here and there, floors and walls made of otherwise clear ice have fantastical patterns of frost traced across them. The patterns have their own eerie beauty. To the untrained eye, these features seem like an unusual natural phenomenon, but a DC 15 Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (dungeoneering), or Appraise check reveals them to be artificial.",

Nelson 8 RETPAHC WEN SRETSNOM Cildabrins are subterranean hunters that prefer temperate or Cildabrin warm underground regions. Incapable of spinning normal webs, cildabrins roam their territory like great wolves, look- ing for any prey they can catch and tear to shreds with their powerful pincers. Once they catch their food, it is poisoned into submission or killed. The cildabrin then retreats to its lair—a warm, dark cave—to eat at its leisure. It devours its prey like a scorpion rather than a spider; its pincers tear off shreds of fl esh small enough for the creature to chew with its mandibles. A cildabrin has no interest in any gear or valuables its prey carries, beyond the possibility that scattering such items around its territory might attract more prey. Sages speculate that cildabrins might be a created race, not one that evolved naturally. Those who espouse this theory point to the aberration’s remarkable similarities to two other natural kinds of arachnid creatures: hunting spiders (such as tarantulas) and scorpi- ons. Cildabrins seem incapable of true speech but can communicate with other arachnids. They are sentient; they merely lack the means to vocalize sounds. When roaming underground, cildabrins sometimes stray perilously close to dungeons, sewers, crypts, and other subterranean elements of civilization. Despite legends to the contrary, it does not seem that cildabrins are tools of the drow. The dark elves fear these terrible beasts at least as much as other humanoids do. In fact, some religious sects among the drow consider the appearance of a cildabrin to be a dire omen.

The plane of lust is an endless world without borders, without curvature and without edge. It can Planar Links The plane of lust links across to the other planes fairly strongly, if it did not reproduction would likely be impossible on other planes, save where procreation has nothing to do with attraction and everything to do with brutality or cold, unfeeling need for progeny. Every time someone or something gets a little hanky-panky in another plane (especially the material world), a little of the energy of the plane of lust is siphoned off and escapes into the real world. Meanwhile the lusts, desires and thoughts of those on the other plane are reflected in the plane of lust in the form of mirages or landscape changes. Some worlds float closer to the plane of lust than others and some almost touch on certain regions of the plane. The world of Goug, for example, exists across a tiny planar boundary from the forest of leather. Replete with sex slaves in skimpy bits of fur and muscle-bound barbarians it spins through the multiverse blissfully unaware of the havoc the plane of lust is causing.

Dolphins are extremely numerous in the seas of this plane and the land is awash with rabbits. These seem to be a symbolic representation of the plane itself and exist in all sizes and varieties. Those who dwell upon the plane consider them a lucky animal. Movement on the Plane of Lust The plane of lust is infinite in size, but the further you travel from your starting point the kinkier and more depraved the landscape and inhabitants become. Between this effect and the constantly changing terrain, the plane can be an extremely confusing place to travel in. The only constant landmark is polyamora, whose great turreted spires and suggestive towers can almost always be seen on the horizon and appear to represent a centre point for the plane as a whole. 27 THE PLANE OF LUST replete with nymphs, dryads, satyrs, centaurs and The rain when it falls is light and warm, just enough other traditional woodland creatures. to make clothes and hair cling to the body in interesting ways, for those who still wear clothes Every tree hangs with its branches low, heavy with anyway.

Pink marble-paved streets wind up and down in a gentle undulation between houses and towers of flesh tone rock. Fountains spray here and there, creating cool spots to rest from the balmy atmosphere of the plane. The squares are filled with markets selling all manner of sexual equipment, books, spells and services. Some from the further reaches of the plane travel here to entice others who share their kinks back with them and others serve in the brothels, which are more common than the taverns and do not charge. With no need for food or drink save for pleasure, the shops that sell such fare all sell luxuries often traded for sexual favours rather than money. The confections are wonders, near magical in their creation and unmatched anywhere else on the planes. Some offer services to prepare their patrons like confectionery and then have it nibbled off them piece by piece. Those places that offer drinks offer exotic cocktails, sweet liqueurs and finely aged spirits. Clothiers sell only the most flattering of outfits cut from the most diaphanous of silks.

They might have arrived here by falling or jumping through the hole in the fl oor of the church (see encounter E7), or they might have been able to enter stealthily by using a stairway. Amid the litter of the collapsed fl oorboards is a dank understory. A partially smashed laboratory work bench stands in the northwest portion of the cellar, including an iron slab surrounded by a clutter of broken equipment of incomprehensible complexity. Something awful groans to the south and shambles forward. RUNNING THIS ENCOUNTER The church understory is dimly lit through the hole in the fl oor above. Treat this as shadowy illumination: Crea- tures have concealment (20% miss chance) and can make Hide checks. If Danovich leapt down into the understory during the previous encounter and survived the drop, place him in the square immediately beneath the one he fell through, and refer to his statistics block in tactical encounter E7 on the preceding pages. If he has time (and the need) to do so, the priest reads his scroll of cure moderate wounds to heal some of the damage he has taken. If any PCs followed Danovich through the hole, place them in appropriate squares adjacent to the priest. Char- acters who have arrived here by using the hatch and the stairway leading down from the ground fl oor of the church can position themselves within 10 feet of the base of the stairway.

A powerful and prosperous country, the leaders of Bazareene have nearly erased poverty from their land and have few problems with strange monsters within their borders. However, this was accomplished with an almost cruel level of oppression and rigidity, and while the common people of Bazareene may be healthy and have homes, they are rarely happy. Known for large families of nobles, with green-eyed sorcerer daughters and martial artist sons, Bazareene is seen by many as a military giant that is not so much sleeping but resting, for it has built a strong army and trained militia to repulse frequent barbarian raids, and in slack years the government uses that army as a tool against its weaker neighbors.

Sutulak was once a simple meeting point between orc and human lands where unscrupulous members of both communities could trade in stolen goods, livestock, and—on occasion—captives. Only after word got out about the place, and corrupt nobles from elsewhere began to arrive in search of slave labor, did the locals realize the potential of their situation. Sutulak grew swiftly into a functional if unattractive city. Today, its buildings are sturdier, its roads wider, and its walls higher, but it’s no less ugly or squalid than before. Sutulak is ruled by a council of its richest citizens— that is, the most powerful slave-traders. An enormous portion of the population consists of slaves and those who guard them, giving the entire city an atmosphere of misery. Sutulak has a higher gp limit than most cities its size due to the constant inﬂ ux of slavers. At any given time it might contain more than 2,000 travelers, both buyers and sellers, in addition to its resident population. ARCHITECTURE As with many other aspects of the city, Sutulak’s archi-tecture is sharply divided along class lines. The stone houses and ofﬁ ces of the powerful are bizarre hybrids of military and opulent styles. They feature strong doors, narrow windows, and high gates to protect against rivals’ forces, assassination attempts, and the constant threat of uprising. Yet they might also display ornate statues or colorful dyes, the better to showcase the wealth of 620_95386_Ch1.indd 16620_95386_Ch1.indd 16 8/21/06 4:44:58 PM8/21/06 4:44:58 PM17CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY the owners. Most of the city’s other structures are wooden and simple, whether they serve as homes for the city’s poor or as shops, taverns, and slave stables. The citizens of Sutulak prefer swift and cheap to difﬁ cult and expensive. The city government devotes some attention to inﬂ uencing the ﬁ rst impressions of visitors. Although Sutulak’s clients arrive simply to do business and are unimpressed with shows of wealth, they do appreciate efﬁ ciency. Thus, the larger and cleaner buildings are clus- tered along the main avenues, so that visitors encounter them before seeing anything else.LAYOUT Sutulak, like other slaver cities, resembles a military compound in terms of general layout. The streets are almost all unpaved, other than the few leading to the slave markets. Those main avenues are wide, if not well kept, to allow carts to carry slaves to and from the markets. Smaller streets are winding and confusing, to slow the escape of any slaves who manage to ﬂ ee. Soldiers stand at all major intersections, and the city’s various districts are walled off from each other. Guarded gates ensure that escaped slaves must bypass multiple obstacles to win freedom. 620_95386_Ch1.indd 17620_95386_Ch1.indd 17 8/21/06 4:45:11 PM8/21/06 4:45:11 PM18 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY A stone defensive wall rings the city, but it is unlike most others. Wooden spikes and embedded broken glass protrude from both sides, and portcullises defend the inside and outside of the heavy wooden doors. Sutulak’s wall is designed to enable defenders to ﬁ ght off invaders from outside or rebelling slaves from within.

Slave quarter PERSONA Sutulak is crowded, dirty, and miserable, and its citi-zens are much the same. The large slave population is wretched but transient, and most of the citizens are poor. Artisans and shopkeepers support the city’s only thriving industry by manufacturing and selling merchandise suited to the needs of slave traders, such as tools, shackles, and simple clothing. Foreign mer- chants do not come here for other kinds of goods, and thus a shop that deals in furniture or tailored clothing ( f or instance ) is only as successful as local demand allows it to be. The constant parade of newly captured slaves, crying in pain and despair, has deadened of the souls of Sutulak’s common people. They go through the motions of daily existence but care little about anything else. In sharp contrast are the few successful slave trad-ers who make their homes in the city. They dwell in fancy buildings, dress in ornate and colorful clothes, and send for delicacies and luxuries from other cities. Like the general population, these people are also i n u r e d t o s u f f e r i n g , b u t t h e y r e v e a l t h e i r s o u l l e s s -ness through greed and cruelty rather than through general ennui. Given such a climate of poverty and misery, it is only natural that crime is rampant in Sutulak. The government deals with criminals as might be expected: It sells them to the slavers . KADDASTREI (THE CAPITAL CITY) Members of the lower class range from the homeless or tenement-dwellers to a few lucky individu- als who own a small, ramshackle house. They live meager lifestyles (see the Variant: Upkeep rules, DMG 130). Even the most productive and hard-working members of a city’s lower class earn only a handful of gold per month—5 gp or less—and some earn only a few coppers a day. Most are poorly educated at best and have few prospects of making their lives any better.

Use it to repair the wax seals used on official messages to prove that they have never been opened; to fix locks and broken windows, hiding evidence of an escape or break-in; to repair torn clothes, hiding evidence of wounds until a body is closely searched; to reattach pages of a book that were stolen for copying; and many similar uses that can hide your trail as effectively as much more potent magics. 2: Rulers dislike it when adventurers become more popular than they are. Public acclaim is nice, but watch for backlash from above. 3: Once blood has been shed or public property destroyed, the city watch doesn’t much care who started it. The magis-trate might listen to your tale of self-defense, but the watch is going to beat heads and clasp manacles first and ask ques- tions later. 4: Nobody gets (or stays) rich by paying more than they have to for services. If a contract seems too high, it doesn’t mean you got lucky—it means you’re probably about to be used or cheated in some fashion. 5: One good, hot meal, when offered to the right person, can buy you as much good will—and therefore as much information and cooperation—as any monster you might slay or any other favor you might perform on that person’s behalf. 620_95386_Ch2.indd 64620_95386_Ch2.indd 64 8/22/06 9:14:23 AM8/22/06 9:14:23 AM65CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERNEW SPELLS The city has its own hazards to deal with, its own hurdles to work around, and its own mystical ﬂ ow. Spellcasters have developed quite a few techniques and methods for dealing with the urban environment. Some are truly only useful in cities, while others are of more broad utility.

Duties: The member must provide to the guild a copy of any new spell or scholastic discovery he researches. Favored Beneﬁ ts: The guild subsidizes the creation of magic items, reducing the character’s raw materials cost by 5%. Sample Contact: Z i n a d r i a H a t h e r f o r d ( h u m a n wizard 7). Zinadria will provide the PC, or one of his companions, the opportunity to copy one spell out of her spellbook. Once every 6 months. CRIMINAL GUILDS These organizations are illegal and highly secretive, except in particularly corrupt cities. They exist for one purpose: to protect their members from the law, the citizenry, and rival criminals. A criminal guild offers its members somewhere to train, compare notes, learn of opportunities, fence stolen goods, or simply lie low for a time. It is particularly valuable as a means of ﬁ nding employment, since those who require an illicit service often approach the guild (which in turn farms the job out to a speciﬁ c member). Membership in the guild is a powerful tool for intimidation and negotiation when dealing with those who know of the organization’s power. C riminal guil ds occasio nall y h a v e an un d e rw o r l d house at the center of their power structure. Examples: Assassins guild, thieves guild. Members must keep all details of the guild secret from nonmembers. They must avoid robbing or otherwise victimizing anyone the guild has declared off limits (either because the individual is paying pro-tection money, or because he poses too great a risk of drawing attention). A member is not required to take every job the guild asks her to perform, but she should have a good reason for refusing. She must obtain guild permission before undertaking any large criminal Illus. by R.

Finally, she must pay to the guild 15% of all profits made from criminal activities, on top of her monthly dues. Favored Beneﬁ ts: The guild provides access to the black market and stolen goods. A member can obtain many goods for a discount, in any city where the guild maintains a presence. The chance of ﬁ nding a speciﬁ c discounted item is a ﬂ at 85% for mundane items, 50% for minor magic items, 25% for medium magic items, and 10% for major magic items. If they are available, mundane items can be purchased for a 10% discount, while magic items are discounted 5%. Note that these items are stolen or contraband, and a PC caught with an identiﬁ ably stolen item on his person could be arrested and charged. Sample Contact: C o l b e n S h e y ( h u m a n b a r d 5 ) . Through a combination of clever lies, forgeries, and a group of “witnesses” he keeps available at all times, Colben can provide an airtight alibi for the PC, insisting that he was in one place when he was actually in another.

GLADIATORIAL STABLES M a n y c i t i e s h a v e a r e n a s w h e r e g l a d i a t o r s b a t t l e i t out—against one another or against various fearsome beasts—for the entertainment of the masses. While many gladiators are slaves, free ﬁ ghters also participate in public matches. A gladiatorial stable is a small guild, usually consisting of a number of gladiators, support staff such as healers and trainers, and an owner or man-ager. Some arenas do not accept free ﬁ ghters who do not b e l o n g t o an e s t a b li s h e d s t a b l e . E v e n if th e y d o , s t a b l e managers often have the contacts and clout to arrange better and more proﬁ table ﬁ ghts. A reputable gladiato- rial stable provides free healing to its members (at least for injuries sustained in the arena), arranges matches between foes, and offers to invest a gladiator’s proﬁ ts in other enterprises if the gladiator so chooses. It can also provide most nonmagical equipment a gladiator might request, though he can usually use such items only in the arena, not on outside adventures. Unlike other guilds, gladiatorial stables do not require monthly dues. They make their profits on fees from the gladiators’ matches (and from betting on the side, of course).

It can compress its body to ﬁ t through openings as small as two inches in width. They range from swamp-green to thick brown in color, blending into the refuse, and usually have various bits of detritus contained within. This might include body parts of people as animals, as well as more mundane items such as broken tools or bits of stone. In most instances, a larger cesspit ooze has likely lived for longer than a smaller one, but not all of them grow larger with age. SOCIETY While they are intelligent, cesspit oozes do not think as other creatures do. They have no sense of community, and they do not appear to recognize even other oozes as living beings.

In a campaign that covers multiple settings, it hardly matters if some characters are more effective in one, and others in another; in fact, such myriad skills are all but essential. In a city-focused campaign, however, a traditional druid or ranger might find her abilities less useful than those of classes such as the rogue or the bard. Of course, you can gear these classes toward adventuring in the city from the start. The urban barbarian is no wild warrior from a distant land, but a rage-driven streetfighter from the worst neighborhoods. The urban druid still seeks to manipulate the natural world while revering its powers, but she may be more interested in the ebb and flow of the city -- and the living things within -- than in the surrounding woods or distant fields. Presented here are urban-oriented alternate class features for the barbarian, druid, ranger, scout (Complete Adventurer), and spirit shaman (Complete Divine) classes. Not all city-dwelling members of these classes possess these features, but the options exist for those who want them. In addition, while the paladin is hardly a wilderness-oriented class, her summoned mount is not appropriate for all city-focused campaigns, so she gains a few alternate class features as well. Several class features presented here reference feats and mechanics found in Cityscape. City-Shape The ability to transform into an animal is the hallmark of the druid, so much so that even many urban druids choose to retain it. Some, however, prefer the ability to blend and maneuver within the streets of the city, sacrificing size for a wider range of forms. bull rush, disarm, or trip. For purposes of adjudicating these attacks, make your touch attack as normal, if one is necessary. When actually resolving the opposed roll, however, substitute your caster level for your base attack bonus and either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice) for your Strength. Because the attack is made at a distance, it does not draw an attack of opportunity that such an attack would draw under normal circumstances, nor can your foe attempt to perform the same maneuver on you in turn, even if such is normally allowed. Cityscape, Part 3 Cityscape, Part 3 Urban Tools By Ari Marmell Cityscape presents a variety of new feats, spells, and warlock invocations that were developed in an urban environment or that you can use in a city-based setting. While these are the most prevalent of new tools and tricks for the urban adventurer, however, they are far from the only ones. For those who do not practice such esoteric arts, not only magic items, but also alchemical and entirely mundane tools, exist to enhance the abilities of the city explorer. Several of the abilities and items herein reference mechanics from Cityscape . For Tools of the Trade The city poses unique challenges, and many a creative craftsman or skilled wizard has risen to meet those challenges. Presented here are a number of items particularly suited to urban adventuring. Alchemical Items Alchemical items often seem like magic to the ignorant, though they are less potent than true magic. The items below include the Craft DC to create them. Alchemical Items Craft (alchemy) Item Weight Cost DC False Paper * 15 gp 20Liquid Light * 25 gp 22 Sewer Mask * 30 gp 25* No significant weight",

Some seek out the dark powers as youths, driven by ambition or the de-sire for power, but a few blameless individuals are simply marked out by the supernatural forces as conduits and tools. The exact na-ture of a warlock ’s origin is up to the player to decide; just as a sorcerer is not beholden to the magic-wielding ancestor that bequeathed his bloodline with arcane power, a warlock is not bound to follow the source that gifted him with magic. Warlocks are not hal f- ﬁ ends or tie ﬂ ings by default (although many creatures of those kinds become some of the most powerful and terrify- ing representatives of the class). The mark that the supernatu-ral powers leave on their servants is often a mark in the soul, not the ﬂ esh. In fact, many warlocks are created by nonevil powers — wild or fey forces that can be every bit as dangerous as demons or devils. Whatever their origin, warlocks are widely feared and misunderstood. Most are wan- derers who rarely stay in one place for long. Backpack with waterskin, 1 day ’s trail rations, bedroll, sack, and ﬂ int and steel. Case with 10 bolts. Spell component pouch.

They are seldom found living with the rest of human society. Instead, they live as hermits in the wilderness, purifying their bodies and minds to contact the various natural and supernatural powers of the world. From these entities they learn their spells —magical means to control the invisible forces of the world. Adventures: Wu jen typically adventure to expand their knowledge of the world, both magical and mundane. Like wizards, they tend to approach adventures with care- ful planning, since their daily spell selection is vitally important. Characteristics: Wu jen are the arcane spellcasters of the Far East. As with wizards, their spells are their primary class feature, and as such assume an all-important role in their lives. Many wu jen spells draw on the power of the five elements (earth, fire, metal, water, and wood). Finally, wu jen are adept at manipulating their spells, increasing their range, duration, or effect, or eliminat-ing verbal or somatic components through permanent metamagic effects. Alignment: Wu jen tend to stand apart from the lawful societies predominant in most cultures, ﬂ outing the rules and norms of decent folk. They have a strong tendency toward chaos, but in any event they cannot be lawful. Background: Wu jen crave magical power in a world where no organized colleges of wizardry typically exist. T h e i r t h i r s t d r i v e s t h e m t o s e e k o u t o t h e r s l i k e t h e m -selves —hermits, recluses, or exiles who have gained the secrets they seek. Nearly all wu jen are trained by a single mentor in this fashion, outcast from proper society and set apart by their fearsome supernatural powers. Races: Most wu jen are humans, though members of all the common races of the eastern lands can learn their craft. Other Classes: Wu jen generally don ’t like members of any other class. At the same time, however, a wu jen is painfully aware that without ﬁ ghters and samurai to block enemy soldiers, a shaman to heal her wounds, and perhaps a rogue to deal with locks and traps, her path to the knowl-edge she seeks might be blocked by insurmountable and possibly fatal obstacles. This realization of her reliance on other classes might make her accept them or might make her resent them. 620_17925_Chpt1.indd 14 620_17925_Chpt1.indd 14 9/15/04 9:21:14 AM 9/15/04 9:21:14 AM15CHAPTER 1 CLASSESGAME RULE INFORMATION Wu jen have the following game statistics. +2 chain shirt, +2 ring of protection, cloak of Cha- risma +2, +1 cold iron rapier, wand of scorching ray (20 charges), wand of ray of enfeeblement (25 charges), wand of searing light (10 charges), scroll of cure critical wounds , potion of bear ’s endurance, 27 pp. SUBLIME CHORD Music is not just a pleasant sound; it is also the expression of mathematical relationships fraught with signi ﬁ cance. A member of the sublime chord prestige class sees music, even the powerful music of a skilled bard, as nothing more than a stepping-stone to true universal insight into the legend-ary song of creation heard at the dawn of time. Music and magic are actually one and the same, and an astute student who unravels the riddles of meter and pitch simultaneously reveals hidden secrets of great power. All sublime chords must have some foundation in the bard ’s art, since bardic music is the first step in master- ing the power of the First Song. However, music is only one tool for understanding the infinite; a sublime chord must also study mathematics and the precise movements of the stars and planets in which the music of the spheres is e vi d e n t. In ex ch an g e f o r a ban do nin g h e r co n tin uin g study of bardic music, a sublime chord instead masters a number of spells far more powerful than most bards can ever use. While most sublime chords receive the majority of their training as bards, a small number of sorcerers and wizards are drawn to this class, enticed by the notion of an ultimate truth linking the power of song and the power of magic. Sublime chords are often drawn to colleges, universities, and other gatherings of learned folk. In some places, such as the Starry Lyceum in the city of Osterhaven, they gather in small circles of musical scholars. The Starry Lyceum is dedicated to the pursuit and preservation of knowledge, and its members are known for their efforts to recover lost secrets and prevent the fading of ancient songs and star-taught wisdom. Ostensibly neutral in the affairs of the world, the sublime chords of the Lyceum make their learning and lore available to all who seek it —a policy that often runs counter to those who would seek to govern or dominate other people by fostering ignorance. NPC sublime chords are encountered in much the same variety of adventures and roles in which one ﬁ nds NPC bards. They blur the line between bard and wizard, and are often mistaken for mages who wield mysterious song-based magic. As scholars without peer, NPC sublime chords are especially interested in recovering lost lore and exploring arcane mysteries, and they often join adventuring parties with similar interests. Adaptation: The Starry Lyceum can serve as the focal point for the inclusion of this prestige class. However, this organization is more than a group; it is really a way of life. Its members are scholars, bards, and mages in search of fundamental truth and dedicated to the preservation of knowledge. In your campaign, you can easily substitute any similar college for the Starry Lyceum. For example, in the F ORGOTTEN REALMS ® setting, the scribes of Candle- keep or the Vault of Sages in Silverymoon would serve quite well in place of the Lyceum for any sublime chord characters. Hit Die: d6. Requirements To qualify to become a sublime chord, a character must ful ﬁ ll all the following criteria. Subject and equipment gain immu- nity to damage of speci ﬁ ed energy type. 7TH-LEVEL CLERIC SPELL Subject and equipment gain immu- nity to damage of speci ﬁ ed energy type. 9TH-LEVEL DRUID SPELLS Subject and equipment gain immunity to damage of speci ﬁ ed energy type.

You can bring one Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear and objects up to its maximum load) per four caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. A cloud chariot ﬂ ies at 10 miles per minute, so that you can cover a distance of 100 miles over the spell ’s full dura- tion. You and your passengers feel none of the effects of this swift movement, though, and the ride is perfectly steady and calm in even the worst weather. When the spell is dis-missed, the cloud settles gently to the ground and dissipates. Should the spell duration expire while a cloud chariot is still aloft, the magic fails slowly, with cloud and riders ﬂ oating downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If the cloud reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, and all creatures riding in it take falling damage. A cloud chariot descends slowly if the spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic ﬁ eld . No A ghostly hand bearing a lit candle appears at the spot you choose, shed- ding light in a 5-foot radius and moving as you desire —forward or back, up or down, straight or around corners at up to 50 feet per round (no concentra-tion required). The hand and candle are incorporeal and can pass through objects, making them a useful tool for simulating hauntings. As well, a corpse candle illuminates hidden, ethereal, and invisible beings and items, all of which become faintly visible as wispy outlines. Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but invisible creatures have only concealment (20% miss chance) and lose their bonus on attack rolls from invisibility when they are within 5 feet of the candle. The ghostly radiance also makes immaterial creatures and items slightly material, so that incorporeal creatures within 5 feet of a corpse candle have only a 30% chance to avoid damage from corporeal creatures (though all other bene ﬁ ts of being incorporeal are retained). The hand is Diminutive, has 1 hit point per caster level, and has AC 14 + a de ﬂ ection bonus equal to your Charisma modi ﬁ er. It makes saves as y o u d o b u t i s i m m u n e t o s p e l l s t h a t don’t cause damage. The spell effect ends if the hand is destroyed, and the hand winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell ’s range. Yes (harmless) This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete protection against damage from one of the ﬁ ve energy types —acid, cold, electricity, ﬁ re, or sonic. Energy immunity absorbs only damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drown- ing in acid, being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice. Yes You conjure a featureless black sphere of nothingness that disintegrates virtually anything it touches. The sphere ﬂ ies up to 30 feet per round, and you must make a ranged touch attack against the single creature or object you wish to target. The sphere stops moving during the round when it attacks, and you must actively direct it to a new target as a move action. When struck by the sphere, a target takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of ﬁ ne dust (though its equipment is unaffected). When used against an object, the sphere disinte-grates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is disintegrated. The effects of the sphere count as a disintegrate spell for the purpose of destroying a wall of force or any other spell or effect speci ﬁ cally affected by disintegrate. If the sphere exceeds the spell ’s range, it winks out. Wizards who take on appren- tices usually teach them many of the same notations and codes they themselves have perfected. A wizard attempting to decipher, prepare, or copy a spell from the spellbook of a master (or apprentice) gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the Spellcraft check. Mastering a Foreign Spellbook: Instead of laboriously copying each spell of interest from a found spellbook into his own, a wizard might instead make a dedicated effort to master the spellbook ’s particular ciphers and notations. This procedure is sometimes referred to as becoming attuned to the spellbook (although it ’s a matter of time and study, not a mystical process). Mastering a spellbook requires a success-ful Spellcraft check (DC 25 + the level of the highest-level spell in the book) and takes one week plus one day per spell contained within. If the wizard succeeds, he can use the foreign spellbook as his own, requiring no further Spellcraft checks to prepare or copy spells from it. If he fails, he cannot attempt to master that spellbook again until he gains at least 1 more rank in Spellcraft. SPELLBOOK CONSTRUCTION Aside from ornamentation and spurious false writings, all spellbooks require one page per spell level (minimum one page) to record any particular spell. The pages of most spellbooks have been treated for durability and protection against ﬁ re, mold, water, parasites, staining, and other hazards. These procedures make even a blank spellbook relatively expensive. The base cost of 15 gp buys a well-bound leather volume of 100 parchment pages, a style also typically used for other high-quality books such as the genealogies of noble families o r t h e m a s t e r c o p i e s o f s a g e s ’ published writings. Exotic materials increase the cost and weight of a spellbook accord-ingly, and these materials are usually reserved for grimoires, not arcanabula. Table 5–1: Spellbooks Cover Weight Hardness Hit Points CostLeather 1 lb. 2 +0 5 gpWood, thin 1 lb. 3 +1 20 gpMetal, soft 5 lb. 5 +4 100 gpMetal, hard 5 lb. 7 +5 200 gpDragonhide 2 lb. 4 +2 200 gpSlipcase +1 lb. +1 +1 +20 gp Pages (100) Weight Hardness Hit Points Cost Parchment 2 lb. +0 1 10 gpPaper, linen 2 lb. +0 2 20 gpVellum 2 lb. +0 3 50 gpBone or ivory 4 lb. +0 4 100 gpMetal foil 20 lb. +1 8 500 gp The weight, hardness, hit points, and cost of a spellbook of unusual construction is the sum of its cover and page con-struction. For example, a book made with a steel plate cover (hard metal) and copper foil pages weighs 25 pounds, has hardness 8, 13 hit points, and costs 700 gold pieces. All ﬁ ne books can be purchased with a waterproof double slipcase of chased and tooled leather, strong enough to pro- tect against driving rain or burial in snow but not against prolonged immersion. Special physical treatments (such as baths in secret herbal tinctures and alchemical solutions designed to retard ﬁ re and mold damage) are included in the above costs. PROTECTING SPELLBOOKS Any wizard with the means to do so will carefully safeguard her spellbooks against accident, battle damage, or theft. Most arcanabula feature cheap and inexpensive protections (often a simple explosive runes or ﬁ re trap ), but for most wizards, the risk of losing a workbook isn ’t enough to justify the expense of high-level protection. Grimoires, on the other hand, are generally stored in the most secret hiding places (sometimes even on other planes) and equipped with mechanical traps, loyal guardians, and deadly spells of defense. The protections applied to a great-book can take virtually any form, from magically sustained poisonous spiders or snakes, to bladders of paralyzing or sleep-inducing gases, to scything blades or poisoned needles concealed in the locks, lids, or frames of the coffers and cabinets the books are hidden in. These traps are never of a design or nature that might endanger the book, but otherwise are almost limitless in the kinds of damage they can in ﬂ ict on the uninvited. Magical protections can add thousands of gold pieces to the cost of even the simplest tome. Some of the most common spellbook defenses include the following. Resistant to Energy (Minor): The book has resistance 5 against acid, cold, electricity, ﬁ re, and sonic attacks. 620_17925_Chpt5.indd 140 620_17925_Chpt5.indd 140 9/15/04 11:26:08 AM 9/15/04 11:26:08 AM141CHAPTER 5 MAGIC ITEMS Moderate abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, resist energy ; Price +1,000 gp.

If you find something on one of those topics from the DUNGEON MASTER\u0027s Guide or the Monster Manual that disagrees with the Player\u0027s Handbook, you should assume the Player\u0027s Handbook is the primary source. The DUNGEON MASTER\u0027s Guide is the primary source for topics such as magic item descriptions, special material construction rules, and so on. The Monster Manual is the primary source for monster descriptions, templates, and supernatural, extraordinary, and spell- like abilities. Wild Shape Player’s Handbook, page 37 Replace sentence 3 of this class feature with the following text: This ability functions like the alternate form special ability (see the Monster Manual), except as noted here. Add the following sentence to the end of paragraph 1: Each time you use wild shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night. Add this new paragraph after the current paragraph 1: Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid\u0027s feet. A Thousand Faces Player’s Handbook, page 37 Add the following sentences to the end of paragraph 1: This affects the druid’s body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid’s appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

Baleful Polymorph Player’s Handbook, page 203 With those exceptions, the target’s normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features. All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. INTRODUCTION The new 3.5 Player’s Handbookprovides one starting package for each character class. This package includes preselected equipment, skills, feats, and spells, plus start- ing gold for a 1st-level character of the iconic character’s race. But what if you want to start a character of another PLAYER’S race—one that’s perhaps not often chosen to go with that class?

If all the items in the encounter’s treasure are expendable, such as potions and scrolls, you don’t want to spend the entire trea- sure value on them. If you did, the characters might find nothing but empty potion bottles and scroll tubes after defeating the encounter. NPCs with Treasure The gear that NPCs carry serves as the bulk of their treasure. The average value of an NPC’s gear is listed on Table 4–23: NPC Gear Value, and examples of what specific gear a character of a given class and level would have are in the sample NPC descriptions in Chapter 4. NPCs may have treasure in addition to their gear, at your discretion, but an NPC’s gear is already worth about three times the average value of a treasure of his or her level. Defeating NPC foes brings about great reward for treasure-seekers, but since the gear is mostly magic that the NPC can use against the charac- ters (some of which is one-use), it all evens out. Other Treasure At times you’re going to want to generate a treasure on the fly that’s not directly related to a monster. You might, for example, have created a devious dungeon full of traps and puzzles with no monsters at all, and now you have to generate the “grand treasure” that the traps were protecting. You can still use the table. First find the average party level, then use the table in the Treasure Values sidebar (page 54) to figure out the wealth the PCs should gain in the course of the adventure. Subtract the total value of all the other treasure in the adventure. What’s left is the value of the grand trea- sure. You can generate the contents randomly by finding the aver- age treasure value on Table 3–3: Treasure Values per Encounter that most closely matches it. That tells you the level of the grand treasure, and you can use that to roll on Table 3–5: Treasure for coins, goods, and items. Using the Treasure Table Cross-reference the level of the treasure on the left with the type of treasure. The level of the treasure is equal to the CR of the monsters in the encounter.

PCS AS LEADERS When PCs gain levels, they also garner reputations. Those who show promise, great power, a path toward success, or perhaps just a friendly demeanor may find that NPCs want to follow them. These NPCs may wish for apprenticeships, employment, or a leader they can look up to. Attracting Cohorts A character of 6th level or higher can start attracting cohorts (see page 104) and followers (see page 105) by taking the Leadership feat (see below). Unlike other feats, this one depends heavily on the social set- ting of the campaign, the actual location of the PC, and the group dynamics. You’re free to disallow this feat if it would disrupt the cam- paign. Be sure to consider the effect of a PC having a cohort. A cohort is effectively another PC in the party under that player’s control, one whose share of XP, treasure, and spotlight time is bound to take some- thing away from the other players’ characters. If your group is small, cohorts may be a great idea. If it’s big enough that a cohort would be a problem, don’t let the PCs have cohorts. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to the Leader’s Reputation Modifier leader’s alignment on either the law-vs.-chaos or good-vs.-evil axis, Great renown +2 and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of Fairness and generosity +1 an alignment different from his own.

The educa - tion of the dwarf people is considered a sacred duty, and those who are considered knowledgeable in dwarf his - tory and legend—and thought to possess above-average common sense—are often called upon to take up the respected role of teacher in the community. While other cultures might see this as a job for young girls or old men, the dwarves see an ollam as a protector of their cherished culture. No one in the dwarf community takes that position lightly. An ollam is granted a special position in the temple hierarchy—Moradin gives her spells that allow her not only to delve into the secrets of the universe but also to heal and keep an eye on her charges. While most ollams are clerics or bards, individuals of other classes are welcomed, as long as they possess the knowledge needed to teach the children properly. NPC ollams are equally likely to be safely ensconced in the heart of a dwarf community, passing on the accumulated lore of their people, or wandering the lands, sharing their knowl - edge with dwarves and nondwarves alike. If there’s something going on in a dwarf city, you can count on the ollams knowing about it ﬁrst. They’re uncommonly well connected with each clan and stratum of dwarf society. You try to incorporate a bypass element enabling you to avoid a trap’s effects if you encounter it again later. Doing this imposes a –10 penalty on your Disable Device check.

For example, you could insert a wedge that blocks the gears of a mechanical trap, or pick out a narrow path between the pressure plates that trigger poison darts from the wall. You can try to disable a device more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to disable any device to a full-round action, add +20 to the DC.

The DM is also free to rule that there are other repercussions in such situ - ations. HANDLE ANIMAL (CHA) This thick white paste, when applied to hands and feet, strengthens and steadies the user’s grip, making it easier for the character to climb. Suregrip provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Climb checks for 1 minute. One dose of suregrip is enough to cover the hands and feet of one Medium creature. Applying suregrip is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. ALCHEMICAL CAPSULES The life of an adventurer demands constant readiness and efﬁcient response to threats. In the heat of combat or the sudden danger of a cave-in, an adventurer rarely has time to apply an alchemical item. Such substances remain useful in those instances where an adventurer knows of a task ahead of time or is lucky enough to spot her foes before they are aware of her presence, but these situations are often the exceptions rather than the rule. To answer the need for a quick-use alchemical item, enterprising adventurers and alchemists have long worked to perfect substances that are easier to apply in the heat of combat, allowing the user to gain the beneﬁt of the item without wasting time that could otherwise be spent attacking the foe or casting a defensive spell. Alchemy’s answer to the adventurer’s need is a simple device that allows the wearer to hold a small amount of an alchemical substance in her mouth. The user can quickly break a capsule (as either a standard or swift action; see Delivery Devices, below), allowing her to continue ﬁght - ing while imbibing the highly concentrated alchemical substance. Alchemical capsules affect only living creatures with a discernible anatomy. Constructs, elementals, oozes, undead, and other creatures that don’t meet this requirement gain no beneﬁt from the use of an alchemi - cal capsule.

Each item is described in detail below. Only one capsule retainer or alchemical tooth can be worn at any one time, and only one alchemical capsule at a time can be stored in each type of delivery system. Using an alchemical capsule requires only a swift action if it is held in a properly worn capsule retainer or alchemi- cal tooth. In the absence of a capsule retainer or alchemical tooth, using an alchemical capsule is a standard action, just like drinking a potion. Fitting an alchemical capsule into an empty capsule retainer or alchemical tooth is a full-round action that provokes attacks of oppor- tunity. This long, ﬂexible pole is the perfect tool for balancing. The pole is 10 feet long, so it cannot be used in any space that allows less than 5 feet of clearance on either side. Provided the user has space to employ the pole properly, it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance checks.

Thieves’ Tools, Longspoon: These specially modiﬁed thieves’ tools are mounted on long, thin handles, enabling the user to manipulate latches, tinker with locks, and probe traps from a position up to 5 feet away and well off to the side of the target device. A 1-inch-diameter mirror mounted on a long handle gives the user a good view of the object being manipulated. Though some traps can inﬂict harm even at a distance, these tools make it possible for a wary rogue to avoid many common hazards, such as poison needles, spurting acid, and the like. Using these tools is more time-consuming and less accurate than taking a direct approach; longspoon tools add 2 rounds to the time required to make a Disable Device or Open Lock check and impose a –2 penalty on any Disable Device or Open Lock check for which they are used. Longspoon thieves’ tools are available in normal or mas - terwork versions.

MASTERWORK INSTRUMENTS This section presents a variety of musical instruments particularly appropriate for adventuring bards. Each entry offers a brief description of an instrument and notes on what races or creatures favor it. This information is not meant as an exhaustive treatment of all such instruments, or even of the wide variations possible within these few. Because each instrument is handcrafted, no two are exactly alike—thus, the size, the number of holes or strings, and other features can vary even between two examples of the same instrument.

Character Beneﬁts: The beneﬁts that an individual gains from membership. Although this section is geared toward players, the DM is free to change the beneﬁts or impose restric - tions on these beneﬁts as he or she sees ﬁt. Nonplayer characters are the most useful tool to convey the importance of an organization, and they can help a DM describe or emphasize a group in several ways. Small Favors: Because NPCs are the most noticeable represen - tatives of an organization, players will come to trust a group of NPC members to do them small favors because of that affilia - tion. For example, an innkeeper who is clearly affiliated with the Daggerspell Guardians might allow the player characters to stay at a 5% discount—even if they’re not members themselves—if they have helped the organization or have done notable good deeds in the past.

These classes repre - sent three very different approaches to missions, adventuring, and killing that members of the clan espouse. Those who follow the path of the ghost-faced killer see their abilities as a powerful tool to use with deliberate purpose. Those who pursue the path of the assassin see their skills as the perfect commodity to sell to the highest bidder, caring less about issues of morality. Those who seek to attain levels in the shadowdancer prestige class have a much looser approach to the clan and its honor (although they still carefully maintain their oaths of secrecy) and prefer lives of adventure to lives of intrigue.

To join the League of Boot and Trail, a prospective member must present a station head with three gifts, all originating from at least 300 miles away. One of these gifts must be a case of liquor worth at least 250 gp, one must be an object of art worth at least 300 gp, and the last must be a riding horse or warhorse. If the gifts meet all the requirements, the candidate is tattooed with the red boot and accepted as a member after a riotous party. Dues are 500 gp per year, payable at the time of the member’s one-month service at a station. Character Beneﬁts: The most signiﬁcant beneﬁt of membership in the League of Boot and Trail is access to the reports of previous travelers. A league station’s information about travel hazards, monsters, and current events isn’t fully up to date, of course, but it’s highly reliable. Any member can use the accommodations at a league station free of charge. Many league stations operate general stores that sell adventuring gear for 20% less than the going rate to those bearing the red tattoo, as well as horses for half price. In addition, merchants and innkeep - ers along important trade routes often offer discounts to travelers with red boot tattoos, hoping for good reviews on the next set of league reports.

Slow to add new members, the Nightsong Guild prefers to work with those it considers potential recruits for several years before actually inviting them to join. Candidates serve as paid informants, freelance burglars, or muscle for hire for long periods of time while their competence and trustworthiness are judged. Although most of these recruits are never told explicitly that they’re working for the Nightsong Guild, the group is pow - erful and notorious enough that most individuals guess correctly where their money comes from. Members are required to con - tribute 10% of their earnings to the guild. In return, they have access to extensive resources (see below). Character Beneﬁts: Within the conﬁnes of its home city, the Night - song Guild can offer its members nearly impenetrable security, well-funded political connections, and access to well-trained and loyal hirelings or followers. Members also have access to the guild’s extensive library, training facilities, and workshops. Many places of business in the city offer 10% discounts on services, goods, and equipment to Nightsong Guild members. These resources can be incredibly useful, but they come with a price. As an efﬁcient and long-lived criminal organization, the Nightsong Guild ﬁnds a proﬁt in every activity that it undertakes. If the guild provides a PC with access to a local baron and guarantees that the baron listens to her request, the guild requires in turn that the character undertake a dangerous mission to further cement that baron’s willingness to obey the wishes of the guild.

Such an organization exists solely to help its individual members spread hatred, destruction, and mayhem. A murder cult is one example of a chaotic evil organization.STEP 3: SIZE Determine how large the organization is and where it is based. If you haven’t already chosen a size based on your campaign needs, roll on Table 6–3: Organization Size. The size (minor, medium, or major) will help you determine the organization’s member population. Table 6–3: Organization Size d% Organization Size 01–40 Minor1 41–90 Medium2 91–100 Major 1 Minor organizations don’t exist in thorps or hamlets. 2 Medium organizations don’t exist in thorps. STEP 4: POPULATION AND RESOURCES After determining the relative size of your organization, use the appropriate column on Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size to determine its population. If you’ve already decided on the membership’s size and population, you can skip this step. Just like a community, every organization has a gold piece limit to its resources based on its size and popula - tion. The gold piece limit is an indicator of the maximum amount of money the organization can afford to spend in any given week, on any one item, or in pursuit of any given objective. The gold piece limit noted in Table 6–4 is for a medium organization. A minor organization has a gold piece limit of one-half the indicated value, while a major organization has a gold piece limit of twice the indicated value. To determine the amount of ready cash in an organiza - tion, or the total value of any given item of equipment for sale at any given time, multiply half the gp limit by 1/10 of the organization’s membership.STEP 5: DEMOGRAPHICS To effectively use an organization in play, you must know its composition. The following guidelines allow you to determine the most common classes and races repre - sented and the levels of the various members belonging to the group, from the leader down to the lowest-ranking associates. Class Demographics The mix of classes represented in any given organization depends on whether that group is exclusive (limiting its membership almost wholly to a single occupation), mixed (with a dominant class and a small representation of other classes), or integrated (including members from a wide variety of classes). Table 6–5: Class Mix Exclusive Primary class 96% Secondary class 2% Tertiary class 1% Other classes 1% Mixed Primary class 79% Secondary class 9% Tertiary class 5% Tertiary class 3% Tertiary class 2% Other classes 2%Integrated Primary class 37% Secondary class 20% Tertiary class 18% Tertiary class 10% Tertiary class 7% Tertiary class 5% Other classes 3% You should decide on a primary class based on the type, alignment, and location of your organization. For instance, most trade-based organizations count experts as their primary class, while religious organizations have adepts, clerics, and other divine spellcasters in the majority. Most thieves guilds are mixed, with a majority of rogues but a fair number of experts, warriors, ﬁghters, bards, and other characters. A typical wizard academy might be exclusive (limiting its membership almost entirely to pure wizards) or mixed (with sorcerers and other arcane casters joining the assemblage). An adventur - ers guild is likely to be highly integrated, with members of all walks of life. Don’t forget to include one or more NPC classes in your demographics, particularly warriors and experts.Highest-Level Members Use Table 6–6 and Table 6–7 to determine the highest- level character in the primary class of your organization. Roll the dice indicated for the class that you have deter - mined is primary, and apply the modiﬁer based on the size of the community found in Table 6–9. For secondary, tertiary, and other classes, use Table 6–8 to determine the highest-level character based on the town size. For instance, in a small city, the highest-level character of the organization’s secondary class will be one-half the result derived from Table 6–6 or 6–7, while the highest-level character of the organization’s tertiary classes will be one-fourth the normal result. Characters of other classes will be 1st level.

The high - est-level character in all other classes will be half the result derived for the tertiary class. Round fractional results down, but treat any result of less than 1st level as 1st level. In any organization, there is a 5% chance that a single member who doesn’t belong to the group’s primary, secondary, or tertiary classes will have a level equal to (or higher than) the highest-level character in your organization’s primary class. This character might repre - sent a “wild card” in the organization, a unique member, or simply a ﬁsh out of water.Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size Community Community Organization Membership1 GP Size Population Minor Medium Major Limit2 Thorp 20–80 n/a n/a 1–2 20 gp Hamlet 81–400 n/a 1–2 3–5 50 gp Village 401–900 1–2 3–5 6–10 100 gp Small town 901–2,000 3–5 6–10 11–25 400 gp Large town 2,001–5,000 6–10 11–25 26–60 1,500 gp Small city 5,001–12,000 11–25 26–60 61–125 7,500 gp Large city 12,001–25,000 26–60 61–125 126–250 20,000 gp Metropolis 25,001+ 61–125 126–250 251+ 50,000 gp 1 These numbers can be used to represent how many members exist in a given community; they need not represent the total number of members in the organization. 2 Halve the indicated value for minor organizations, and double it for major organizations.186 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 187CHAPTER 6 Such an organization exists solely to help its individual members spread hatred, destruction, and mayhem. A murder cult is one example of a chaotic evil organization.STEP 3: SIZE Determine how large the organization is and where it is based. If you haven’t already chosen a size based on your campaign needs, roll on Table 6–3: Organization Size. The size (minor, medium, or major) will help you determine the organization’s member population. Table 6–3: Organization Size d% Organization Size 01–40 Minor1 41–90 Medium2 91–100 Major 1 Minor organizations don’t exist in thorps or hamlets. 2 Medium organizations don’t exist in thorps. STEP 4: POPULATION AND RESOURCES After determining the relative size of your organization, use the appropriate column on Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size to determine its population. If you’ve already decided on the membership’s size and population, you can skip this step. Just like a community, every organization has a gold piece limit to its resources based on its size and popula - tion. The gold piece limit is an indicator of the maximum amount of money the organization can afford to spend in any given week, on any one item, or in pursuit of any given objective. The gold piece limit noted in Table 6–4 is for a medium organization. A minor organization has a gold piece limit of one-half the indicated value, while a major organization has a gold piece limit of twice the indicated value. To determine the amount of ready cash in an organiza - tion, or the total value of any given item of equipment for sale at any given time, multiply half the gp limit by 1/10 of the organization’s membership.STEP 5: DEMOGRAPHICS To effectively use an organization in play, you must know its composition. The following guidelines allow you to determine the most common classes and races repre - sented and the levels of the various members belonging to the group, from the leader down to the lowest-ranking associates. Class Demographics The mix of classes represented in any given organization depends on whether that group is exclusive (limiting its membership almost wholly to a single occupation), mixed (with a dominant class and a small representation of other classes), or integrated (including members from a wide variety of classes). Table 6–5: Class Mix Exclusive Primary class 96% Secondary class 2% Tertiary class 1% Other classes 1% Mixed Primary class 79% Secondary class 9% Tertiary class 5% Tertiary class 3% Tertiary class 2% Other classes 2%Integrated Primary class 37% Secondary class 20% Tertiary class 18% Tertiary class 10% Tertiary class 7% Tertiary class 5% Other classes 3% You should decide on a primary class based on the type, alignment, and location of your organization. For instance, most trade-based organizations count experts as their primary class, while religious organizations have adepts, clerics, and other divine spellcasters in the majority. Most thieves guilds are mixed, with a majority of rogues but a fair number of experts, warriors, ﬁghters, bards, and other characters. A typical wizard academy might be exclusive (limiting its membership almost entirely to pure wizards) or mixed (with sorcerers and other arcane casters joining the assemblage). An adventur - ers guild is likely to be highly integrated, with members of all walks of life. Don’t forget to include one or more NPC classes in your demographics, particularly warriors and experts.Highest-Level Members Use Table 6–6 and Table 6–7 to determine the highest- level character in the primary class of your organization. Roll the dice indicated for the class that you have deter - mined is primary, and apply the modiﬁer based on the size of the community found in Table 6–9. For secondary, tertiary, and other classes, use Table 6–8 to determine the highest-level character based on the town size. For instance, in a small city, the highest-level character of the organization’s secondary class will be one-half the result derived from Table 6–6 or 6–7, while the highest-level character of the organization’s tertiary classes will be one-fourth the normal result. Characters of other classes will be 1st level. Table 6–6: Highest-Level Members (PC Classes) PC Class Character Level (Primary Class) Barbarian 1d4 + community modifier Bard 1d6 + community modifier Cleric 1d6 + community modifier Druid 1d6 + community modifier Fighter 1d8 + community modifier Monk 1d4 + community modifier Paladin 1d3 + community modifier Ranger 1d3 + community modifier Rogue 1d8 + community modifier Sorcerer 1d4 + community modifier Wizard 1d4 + community modifier Table 6–7: Highest-Level Members (NPC Classes) NPC Class Character Level (Primary Class)Adept 1d6 + community modifier Aristocrat 1d4 + community modifierCommoner 4d4 + community modifierExpert 3d4 + community modifier Warrior 2d4 + community modifier In larger communities, there is a chance that the highest-level character in the secondary class will use the normal result from Table 6–6 or 6–7, and a chance that the highest-level character in the tertiary class will be determined just as for the secondary class. The high - est-level character in all other classes will be half the result derived for the tertiary class. Round fractional results down, but treat any result of less than 1st level as 1st level. In any organization, there is a 5% chance that a single member who doesn’t belong to the group’s primary, secondary, or tertiary classes will have a level equal to (or higher than) the highest-level character in your organization’s primary class. This character might repre - sent a “wild card” in the organization, a unique member, or simply a ﬁsh out of water.Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size Community Community Organization Membership1 GP Size Population Minor Medium Major Limit2 Thorp 20–80 n/a n/a 1–2 20 gp Hamlet 81–400 n/a 1–2 3–5 50 gp Village 401–900 1–2 3–5 6–10 100 gp Small town 901–2,000 3–5 6–10 11–25 400 gp Large town 2,001–5,000 6–10 11–25 26–60 1,500 gp Small city 5,001–12,000 11–25 26–60 61–125 7,500 gp Large city 12,001–25,000 26–60 61–125 126–250 20,000 gp Metropolis 25,001+ 61–125 126–250 251+ 50,000 gp 1 These numbers can be used to represent how many members exist in a given community; they need not represent the total number of members in the organization. 2 Halve the indicated value for minor organizations, and double it for major organizations.188 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 189CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS Table 6–9: Community Modifiers Community Community Size Modifier Thorp –3* Hamlet –2* Village –1 Small town +0 Large town +3 Small city +6 Large city +9 Metropolis +12 * A thorp or a hamlet has a 5% chance to add +10 to the modifier of a ranger or druid level. Total Characters of Each Class Use the following method to determine the levels of all the characters in an organization of any given class. If the highest-level character of a given class indicated is 4th level or above, assume that there is one additional character of that class of half that level. If this process results in a character who is 4th level or higher, assume that there are two characters of half that character’s level. Continue until the number of 2nd- or 3rd-level charac - ters is generated. Do not generate 1st-level members in this manner. After you have determined the number of 2nd- and 3rd-level characters of each class, divide the remaining population so that it matches the class demographics of the organization. For instance, if 37% of an organization are rogues, then 37% of the leftover membership are 1st-level rogues. Repeat for each class present in the organization. You can also round out any organization with a few characters of classes not represented in the organization’s typical mix. For instance, even if your thieves guild doesn’t have a listing for wizards, you can still add one to the membership. Don’t forget to include multiclass or prestige-class characters as appropriate. Your final membership numbers—particularly the 1st-level characters of PC classes—might not match up well with the expected quantity of that class in the community, as indicated in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide . Don’t worry too much about this. That book’s method of determining the number of characters with PC class levels might be too con - servative for your campaign, particularly if you have many cities and metropolises (which are likely to have large, powerful organizations). If you need a reason for this discrepancy, consider the possibility that the organization has drawn a great number of members from outlying towns and villages. Also, remember that many low-level characters might belong to more than one organization.Leader of the Organization The leader of an organization is usually the highest-level character of the primary class. Roll on Table 6–10: Organization Leader or select an appropriate character to lead the group. Table 6–10: Organization Leader d% Leader 01–70 Highest-level character of primary class71–85 Second-highest-level character of primary class86–95 Highest-level character (regardless of class) 96–100 Other (DM’s choice) Racial Demographics Most organizations mirror the local racial mix, though exceptions are common. Use Table 6–11: Racial Demo - graphics, or select an appropriate racial mix for your organization. Table 6–11: Racial Demographics d% Demographics 01–60 Same as community1 61–90 More isolated than community2 91–100 More integrated than community3 1 See the Racial Mix of Communities table, page 139 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. 2 Use the racial mix one step toward isolated. If the community already uses the isolated racial mix, treat as isolated. 3 Use the racial mix one step toward integrated. If the community already uses the integrated racial mix, treat as integrated. STEP 6: FLESH OUT THE DETAILS At this point, all that’s left is to breathe life into the framework you’ve created. Provide the organization with a name, turn your NPCs into full-ﬂedged characters (with personalities and backgrounds as appropriate), and link the organization to your campaign history. Now’s the time to determine other crucial details about the group you’ve created. Is it a secretive organization whose existence is known only to its members? Even a craft guild might pride itself on secrecy and mystery. How hard or easy is it to join the group? What kind of insignias, code words, or secret handshakes does the group use? Does the group enjoy support (whether public or private) from local authorities, or is it a renegade assembly? Is the organization respected by the populace, or are its members social pariahs? These and other details are what will transform your organization from a mere collection of numbers into a full-ﬂedged part of your campaign.APPENDIX: THE EPIC ADVENTURER The Player’s Handbook establishes 20th level as the limit of a character’s power and experience. The Dungeon Master’s Guide , however, provides rules for going beyond that limit to 21st level and higher. Such characters are called epic-level characters and use slightly modiﬁed rules to govern their interactions. This section addresses some issues relevant to epic skill-using characters, from becoming an epic character, to advancing to epic levels in prestige classes, to new epic feats. BECOMING AN EPIC-LEVEL ADVENTURER The passage from everyday hero to epic hero isn’t a given fact of life in all games. Every DM has his or her own opinions about how (or if) to incorporate epic-level char - acters into the campaign. Assuming that your campaign offers characters the opportunity to achieve 21st level, this section provides some advice for the player and DM of a rogue, ranger, bard, or similar character to use when approaching that point. More than any other type of character, great adventur - ers of lore are identiﬁed with daring tasks of guile, skill, and sheer chutzpah. Jason led a band of mythic heroes on a great quest for the golden ﬂeece. Orpheus braved the horrors of the underworld with only his musical talent to rescue his beloved Eurydice. The legendary hunter Orion claimed he could kill any animal in the world. Loki stole anything he could get his hands on, including the Golden Apples of Idun and the Necklace of Brisingamen. In order to reach 21st level, an adventurer might have to accomplish a task of such daring that even the gods take notice of his skill. Another mark of a legendary skilled character is his talent in a particular area of expertise. While anyone with 23 ranks in a single skill might claim to be the best in the world, epic contests involving such skills are the only way of proving such a claim. Whether such a contest takes the form of a series of ever more difﬁcult tasks (such as a set of ﬁendishly trapped locks that must be opened safely) or a single challenge of titanic proportions (such as swimming across an ocean), the contest must be truly memorable in its scope and difﬁculty. You can, of course, use similar goals or quests even for nonepic characters.

Shelves and pegs linethe walls, and a rack for hanging wet clothing runsdown the center. Usually, the shelves and pegs hold no more than a few travel-stained garments, but when a banquet ormeeting is in progress, the room is packed with gear.On such occasions, both doors are kept locked and analarm spell is placed in the room for extra security. The passkeys that Colver and the masters carry (see theFeatures section) fit these doors. Dock This simple wooden pier runs about a foot above thesurface of Loch Firrnen. Visitors and residents alike cantie up rowboats here, or sit and enjoy nature, or even fishor swim. The lake is only about 4 feet deep at the end ofthe pier, so jumping off is much safer than diving. Front Hall (EL 14) A flight of stone steps rises about 5 feet to the college’soak front door. Read or paraphrase the following whenthe PCs arrive. First-time visitors to the college often don’t know what to make of this imposing chamber. The mosaic pattern on the floor traces an elaborate labyrinth that follows a path from the front door to theroom’s center. This design represents the FochlucanCollege’s role in the world, which is to navigate the“labyrinth” of politics and diplomacy to reach a desiredend. Exactly what that end might be, the Fochlucan masters aren’t saying—at least not yet. The tapestries lavishly illustrate a folktale involving twin brothers who are rivals for a lady’s hand.

Guest House (EL 9, 10, or 11) A half dozen of these small buildings stand on thecollege grounds; the one shown on the map is a typicalexample.

The sleeping room hastwo or three beds, each with a small trunk for storingpersonal gear at its foot. One or two wardrobes andchests of drawers for storing clothing round out thefurnishings. Anyone staying in a guest house is given a key to its door.",

When they reach the Lower Planes, the conflict begins in earnest, with the inhabi- tants attacking the invaders from Regulus every step of the way. When the much-reduced force returns to Mechanus, the few remaining troops march straight to their superiors to report. What they say in this meeting is the subject of much speculation: Some claim that they report on the progress of the modron invasion; others insist that they merely describe the state of the planes. Granted, this seems a difficult way to gather knowledge, but perhaps the modron mind sees some particular logic about it. Whatever the case, the report is inexplicable to everyone except modrons. Over the centuries, the inhabitants of the other planes have grown accustomed to the March. Previous Marches are well documented, and an adventurous few have roughed out some of the probable routes for upcoming ones. 5 THE MODRON Anyone who watches the Orrery tick and whir for at least 1 hour can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check CATHEDRAL (DC 30) to discover that the device is actually a working Deep in the heart of Regulus, there stands a tower model of the planes, incredibly detailed and infinitely that appears to defy all the laws of mechanics.

This requires 200 gallons of water. Then carve off a small piece of the damp barge to carry with you. Higher-Order Ability: Once per week, you can drop or throw half of your piece of the barge into water to cause a phantom version of the vessel to appear on that spot (which must be large enough to support the barge’s Colossal size, or nothing happens). You can then command the barge to voyage to any point on the water within one day’s travel (about thirteen miles upriver—double that when traveling downriver). When one full day has passed, the barge sinks to the bottom, along with anything and anyone still aboard, and vanishes, although your piece of the barge appears in your hand at the same time.

TEMPLE OF THREE (EL 10) A long row of statues, called the Avenue of Sphinxes, leads to the main entrance of this temple, which was originally a small part of a greater temple compound. Of that com- pound, only the Temple of Three remains. The rest of the buildings are tumbled ruins, and even the Temple of Three has seen better days. Passing through the outer pylons into the nave of the temple, visitors discover a triple shrine dedicated to the worship of three mighty deities of old: Set, Sobek, and Apep. A grand frieze on the back wall of the nave depicts each of these deities, Apep in the ascendant.
