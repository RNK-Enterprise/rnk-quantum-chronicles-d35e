THE ASTRAL PLANE The Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a charac- ter moves through an interplanar portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane, such as dimension door, briefly touch the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Large tube-shaped clouds slowly coil into the distance, some appearing like thunderheads and others looking like immobile tornadoes of gray wind. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain. Both planar travelers and refugees from other planes call the Astral Plane home. The most prominent denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an outcast race that preys on travelers throughout the plane. The Astral Plane has the following traits. • Subjective directional gravity. • Timeless. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing don’t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane. • Mildly neutral-aligned. • Enhanced magic. All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be em- ployed as if they were im- proved by the Quicken Spell feat. Already quick- ened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.",

The ultimate ruler of Sigil is an enigmatic being known as the Lady of Pain, a floating female humanoid with bladelike hair. The full extent of the Lady of Pain’s abilities is unknown, but it is widely assumed that her power equals or exceeds that of the deities.

Assuming that the Material Plane of your campaign is essentially the same as the Material Plane of the D\u0026D cosmology, you need to decide what your cosmology will contribute to the campaign.
