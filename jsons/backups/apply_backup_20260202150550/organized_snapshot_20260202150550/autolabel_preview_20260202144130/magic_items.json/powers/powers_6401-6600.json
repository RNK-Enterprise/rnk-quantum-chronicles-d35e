Rebellious young goliaths often learn the traits of self-suffi ciency and independence—useful in a future career as an adventurer—when they spend a lot of time being shunned for minor infractions. Has your goliath character been shunned by his tribe? If so, for what infraction? How does he feel about this?

If the rune circle is smaller or larger than 10 feet in radius, the DM may choose to reduce or increase the cost according to Table 7–7: Variant Rune Circle Sizes. In some cases, the estimated gold piece value might not fully represent the appropriate value for a rune circle. For instance, a rune circle that grants a bonus on Craft checks is worth more than the estimate would suggest, since the circle’s lack of portability isn’t a signifi cant factor in its util- ity.
