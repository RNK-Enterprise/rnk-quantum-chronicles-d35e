Sand golems seem to be a part of the earth. They can move readily through sand and loose soil at their burrow speed, and they can do so indefi nitely, since they have no need to breathe. When fashioned, a sand golem is keyed to a set of magic amulets, usually in the shape of scarabs or scorpions. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of an amulet as its master, obeying that person’s commands without fail. The wearer of an amulet can call the sand golem from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane, no matter how long this might take.
