Such creatures are normally left among their mortal kin, never again thought of by their otherworldly sires. Half-elementals always have some aspect of their ele- mental nature displayed in both their appearance and their temperament. Half-air elementals often have their hair blown about in mysterious breezes and a breathy voice. Sometimes people describe them as flighty, for it’s hard for them to concentrate too long on any one topic. Half-earth elementals have a rocky sheen to their flesh. They are often slow to act but stubborn once committed. Half-fire elementals have a reddish tint to their hair, eyes, or skin. They are temperamental and quick to jump to conclusions. Half-water elementals have a blue-green hue about them—either in their hair or their skin. They are usually nurturing and giving, but terrible when angered. Creating a Half-Elemental “Half-elemental” is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more (referred to hereafter as the “base creature”). Because the half-elemental is still mostly flesh, it cannot be of the ele- mental type. Instead, the creature’s type changes to “out- sider.” It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.",

Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creature’s body, that process and the ritual can be performed together. When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused. On the final day of the ritual, the creator must person- ally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun.

EPHEMERAL SWARMS IN EBERRON Ephemeral swarms sometimes manifest in cities recover- ing from a terrible animal or vermin infestation. These undead swarms are the remnants of one or more swarms that were previously exterminated. Ephemeral swarms are also encountered in the ruined strongholds of the Dhakaani Empire and the haunted halls of Nolunthrone, a ruined dwarf city beneath the Ironroot Mountains in the Mror Holds. EPHEMERAL SWARMS IN FAERÛN Ephemeral swarms haunt the Underdark and various dun- geons scattered across Faerûn (see Known Dungeons of Faerûn, pages 293–296 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, for likely locations). They also haunt the labyrinthine sewers of Faerûn’s oldest cities, the Mulhorandi capital of Skuld in particular.
