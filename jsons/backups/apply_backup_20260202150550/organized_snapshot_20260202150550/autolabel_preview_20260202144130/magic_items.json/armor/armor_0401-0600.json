Wandering druids embrace the whole of nature rather than tying themselves to a particular grove. While she might stay for a night at an isolated farmhouse or briefly share a woodsman’s hut, she is likely to avoid settlements altogether, visiting animal populations instead. A wandering druid may have a major impact on an area she passes through without the human or humanoid residents even being aware of her presence. Her goals are to see all the wide variety of animals and plants the world holds (or as many as can be encountered in one life time) and to restore balance where nature is suffering. Thus she might take steps to put a stop to reckless slash-and-burn agriculture if it were harming a forest, advise farmers on better irrigation techniques in a drought, or introduce predators to thin the overprotected royal herd of deer.

These feats deal mostly with tactical combat. SUDDEN METAMAGIC FEATS Sudden metamagic feats are a new kind of metamagic feat. You choose whether to apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell as you cast the spell. You can apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell of any level, and it does not affect the spell’s level for the purpose of determining which spell slot it occupies. You can apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell that has already been enhanced by a regular metamagic feat. However, the sudden metamagic feat cannot be of the same type as the reg- ular metamagic feat (for instance, you can’t use Sudden Extend on a spell that has already been extended). A sudden metamagic feat doesn’t require a full-round action from casters who choose spells as they cast them, such as sorcer- ers and bards.

Playing in rounds ensures that everyone gets the chance to play the same number of battles. Step 1: Pairing For the first round, players can pair off in any agreeable fashion. In subsequent rounds, pairing is based on scores. The two top-ranked players play each other, as do the third and fourth, fifth and sixth, and so on. If there are tied scores, the tied players roll randomly to see who plays whom. Two players who were matched up on the previous round, however, cannot play each other again until each has played someone else.

Typically, the XP award for a delve is equal to that awarded for defeating a monster whose CR is equal to the dungeon level + 6. For example, after conquering a 3rd-level dungeon, the party receives XP equal to what they would get for defeating a CR 9 monster (see Table 2–6, page 38 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). For instance, if the PCs in this case are 3rd level, they gain 7,200 XP. TREASURE In a campaign game, PCs can sell treasure between delves and use the cash to purchase other items. Characters may want to keep some cash on hand to buy off greedy creatures. NEW CHARACTERS In a one-shot dungeon, the idea of introducing new char- acters or replacing a dead one is irrelevant. The players can simply choose the characters they want each time, because there’s no continuity between one delve and the next. In a random dungeon campaign, however, you’ll need to have a policy for bringing in new characters (including replacing dead ones). The easiest policy is simply that the new character starts at the same place the original character did in terms of level and wealth.
