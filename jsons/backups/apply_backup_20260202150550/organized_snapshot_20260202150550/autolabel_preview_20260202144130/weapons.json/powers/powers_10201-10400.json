But go where? To Manifest, of course! The city of Manifest is the heart of every Ghostwalk campaign. Poised above the entrance to the land of the dead, this is the place where every soul comes when it has shaken off its mortal body. Adventures may lead your characters to the far corners of the campaign world, but in the end they will always come back to Manifest . . . one way or another. THE HISTORY OF MANIFEST In the early days, when the mists of creation still rose from the brand-new world, an elf named Thaerana swore never to leave the side of her brother Thaedon. The two fought against the dark forces that plagued the freshly born world, until Thaedon fell to the horrific blows of a demon’s sword. Thaerana took her oath seriously and, with the help of spells of her own devising, traced Thaedon’s spirit to a narrow stretch of the Hikirian peninsula, and to a peculiar grove of trees. Thaerana managed to follow the trail to one tree in particular— one tall and strong, teeming with life force. Her brother was here, there could be no doubt. Thaerana knew she had found the realm of the afterlife. Many years later, the elves—who now dedicated themselves to tending and protecting the slowly spreading grove of “spirit trees”—found a small cave. They sent in a team of explorers who found a winding series of tunnels leading downward, ever downward. Moreover, the tunnels appeared to be haunted. The woods above were home to the ghosts of many elves, so in the tunnels, the explorers expected to see more of the elf spir- its, perhaps those whose deaths were so violent or shameful that they shunned the company of their brothers and sisters. The elf explorers were shocked to instead find the ghosts of humans, halflings, gnomes, and dwarves roaming the caverns in great number—with not an elf spirit among them. An even greater surprise lay ahead. Just when the elves were ready to turn back and report on the strangely haunted caves, they heard odd noises coming from deeper in the earth. Bravely, they followed the sounds down to where it seemed the tunnel system stopped at a huge gate of stone and iron. The gate was guarded by dwarves in gleaming armor—living dwarves. These were the Deathwarden dwarves, and they were as DURGERTH THE CONQUEROR coolly aloof then as they are today. They spoke only a little From the south, the hordes of Durgerth the Conqueror to the elf explorers.

Transforming Inuitea’s fleet of merchant and fishing vessels into macabre ships of war (brimming with skeletons, zombies, and much worse), the forces of Xaphan reached the mainland and swept over the Hikirian Peninsula. Fortunately, the clerics of both Aluvan and Dracanish foresaw the coming of this undead horde and rallied support from Salkiria, Tereppek, and the other nearby kingdoms. Xaphan’s forces were met by legions from those kingdoms along with the sorcerous might of the Piran Sedestadel. 77 MANIFEST THE CITY OF CHAPTER 2: 620_88566_Ghostwalk3.qxd 4/4/03 9:25 AM Page 77 pqs TIMELINE 1,000 years ago Manifest is established 930 years ago Durgerth invades 750 years ago Manifest is rebuilt 720 years ago Manifest Accord is formed 600 years ago The Dead War 300 years ago People return to Manifest, Khardon Court formed 290 years ago Yisa-komas and Piran Sedestadel formed 280 years ago The demon fever plague 100 years ago The Day of Xaphan and the Liche War 30 years ago The yuan-ti are defeated pqs Spirit Wood.

This brings them into direct (and sometimes literal) conflict with the Yisa-khardomas. The Quiet Knights are a secret soci- ety, its membership—in fact, its very existence—unknown to many or- dinary citizens. Some people theorize that the Knights have pen- etrated all levels of gov- ernment and society, but most think that’s just paranoia. The order has members from every social stratum of the city’s permanent, living residents (most of whom are at least slight- ly prejudiced against the ghost population, anyway). The knights are organized into small cells, each cell is led by a single individual called a Quiet Shepherd. Yeddayne Stonebank (fe- male dwarf Ftr9) is the current Hushed Mistress, the acknowledged leader of the order as a whole.

Whether they are a natural side effect of the Manifest Ward, a strange mutated form of insect, or a magical crossbreed by a demented ectomancer, ectoplasmic vermin—often called ghost bugs—plague the buried cities on the way to the Veil of Souls. They resemble many-legged insects made of semitransparent hard- ened ectoplasm, although the shape of their bodies varies from individual to individual, as do their number of eyes and legs. Visible within their carapaces are tiny translucent organs. They skitter about on walls and floors, attacking any creatures they see. They breed quickly, so the seasonal purges sponsored by various churches cull their numbers only for a short while. When their numbers swell, they have been known to attack surface creatures at night, but they usually con- fine themselves to the dark places underground. Ectoplasmic vermin are made of living ectoplasm and are affected by attacks that affect ectoplasm, such as disrupt ectoplasm. Unlike ghosts, they have dis- cernible anatomies and are therefore subject to critical hits and sneak attacks. COMBAT Ghost bugs search for prey in packs in a manner simi- lar to that of hunting spiders. When slain, they dis- solve into puddles of ectoplasm, which evaporate in the normal fashion. 161 MONSTERS CHAPTER 5: 620_88566_Ghostwalk3.qxd 4/10/03 2:17 PM Page 161 Tiny Small Medium-Size Tiny Vermin Small Vermin Medium-Size Vermin",

GHOST (TEMPLATE) A ghost is the semitangible soul of a creature that has died. Instead of a physical body made of muscle, bone, and blood, it has a ghost body made of transparent ectoplasm. Ghosts are not undead, although they are often mistaken for undead by the truly ignorant. They do not need to eat (although they can if they want to) or sleep as they did when alive. When a ghost is wounded, it leaks ectoplasm like a living creature leaks blood. In general, a ghost appears as it did at the moment its physical body died, although some ghosts learn how to reshape their ectoplasm and alter their appearance. A ghost body is made of transparent ectoplasm, and an alert observer can easily recognize the identity of the ghost and that the ghost is not a physical person. Most ghosts try to get their bodies raised from the dead (which causes the ghost to merge with the physical body) or search for whoever was respon- sible for their death, while others become ghosts willingly to pursue some goal or escape some terrible 163 MONSTERS CHAPTER 5: 620_88566_Ghostwalk3.qxd 4/10/03 2:17 PM Page 163 Disembodied Soul (Ex): As a disembodied soul of a Abilities: A ghost retains all of its original ability living creature, a ghost can be raised or resurrected if scores.

SYNOPSIS This is a section of the upper Undercity that has been cleaned up and renovated to be used as a base by a gang of thieves and bandits. They are led by a medusa sorcerer who has been robbed of her gaze attack. She uses her magic to enhance the bandits, and the aid of a cleric of Phaant provides them with magic crossbow bolts to make them more effective raiders. The ban- dits are not associated with the Golden and may come under attack from the thieves’ guild, eventually. There are many weak creatures in this place that won’t pres- ent much of a challenge to the heroes, but the leaders are a respectable threat. THE BASE The bandits have cleaned out eleven buildings in the northern part of the Undercity and walled off the nearby streets with piles of rubble. The place is now much like a fortress and is hard to notice because the bandits are careful not to use lights outside their homes unless absolutely necessary (they use lanterns and candles within the buildings, and the windows have been covered over to prevent light leakage).
