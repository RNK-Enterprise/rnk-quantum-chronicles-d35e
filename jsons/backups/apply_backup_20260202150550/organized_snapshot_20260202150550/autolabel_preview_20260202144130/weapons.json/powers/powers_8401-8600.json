For higher- level play, the cultist makes a good minion for a powerful dragon, undead, outsider, or elemental seeking to establish a cult of its own. She could even be a local priest who just happens to belong to a thieves’ guild. Not all cultists are evil; a cult of lawful neutral inevitable- worshiping maniacs can be just as creepy and menacing as a cult of demon worshipers. Alternatively, in an area where the bad guys hold all the power, cultists such as this one could be worshipers of a good deity who have been forced to live secret lives in the hidden corners of a debased and hateful society. The NPC presented here happens to be a cultist of Nerull. If you wish to make a cultist for a different deity, just change the character’s domains and alignment as appropriate.

Some of these business-related events can increase profi tability for a term, but most present challenges that must be overcome if the business is to survive. Consult Table 6–7 to see what sort of business-related events occur. Roll once per term for low- and medium-risk businesses, and twice per term for high-risk businesses. The timing of the events is left to you, but you should strive to have them occur at times when the owner is able to react to the event. If an owner is away for extended periods of time, there’s little he can do and he simply has to accept what chance has to offer. As the business continues to grow and more events occur, try to weave them together so that they build logically from one another.
