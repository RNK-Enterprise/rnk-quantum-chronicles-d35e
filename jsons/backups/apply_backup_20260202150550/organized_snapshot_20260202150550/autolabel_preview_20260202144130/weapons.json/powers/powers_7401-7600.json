Fearsome Presence (Ex): A bloodscaled fury is a terror to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart in-spires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragon’s frightfulpresence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC toresist the ability is increased by the dragon’s class level. Crea-tures with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 the dragon’sclass level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws,while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both feareffects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6). Draconic Fury (Ex): At 2nd level, a bloodscaled fury’s rage becomes more fearsome. While raging, its Strengthand Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 pointsand it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves.Thus, an 11th-level barbarian/2nd-level bloodscaled furygains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on itsWill saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at –2.) At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level blood-scaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scoresand +6 on its Will saves. Scales of Blood (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a blood- scaled fury earns its name. When it enters a rage, smallquantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining theiredges and adding to the dragon’s fearsome appearance.More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragonfrom spells and weapon damage. For the duration of thedragon’s rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level,and its damage reduction improves as well. The numberbefore the slash in the dragon’s damage reduction increasesby 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled fury’sdamage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold ironweapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons.For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gainsdamage reduction 15/magic while raging. At 7th level, itgains damage reduction 15/magic and cold iron whileraging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epicand cold iron while raging.Rend: At 4th level, a bloodscaled fury gains Rend (see page 73) as a bonus feat, even if it doesn’t have the prerequisites. Extended Fury (Ex): At 5th level, a bloodscaled fury can remain in a rage for a number of rounds equal to 6 + itsCon modifier. Incite Rage (Ex): At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters arage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet,granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 moralebonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves,and a –2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragonremains raging. This ability is otherwise identical tonormal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end ofthe rage. Tireless Fury (Ex): At 9th level, a bloodscaled fury no longer becomes fatigued at the end of its rage. Blinding Speed (Ex): A 12th-level bloodscaled fury can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 12 rounds each day . The duration of the effect need not be con-secutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action. Ex-Bloodscaled Furies A bloodscaled fury that becomes lawful loses all class fea-tures and cannot gain more levels as a bloodscaled fury .

W eapon and Armor Profi- ciency: A dragon ascendant gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Awesome Aura (Ex): A dragon ascendant loses its in- nate frightful presence, replac- ing it with a special fear aura. This aura surrounds the drag- on at any radius it chooses up to the extent of its frightful presence (30 feet ×the dragon’s age category), and is always ac- tive unless the dragon chooses to deactivate it. The dragon can choose to exclude its own allies from the effect of its aura. Creatures within the aura must make a Will save (DC equal to the dragon’s frightful presence DC plus 1/2 its dragon ascendant levels). Creatures that fail their saving throws are shaken, while those that succeed are immune to the effect of that dragon’s aura for 24 hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken crea- tures must attempt a second Will save (same DC) orbecome frightened. 91CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS Illus. by J.

All allies of the dragon within the radius of itsaura receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, andchecks. The dragon’s foes must succeed on a Will savingthrow or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. When a dragon ascendant reaches 10th level, it gains a third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected crea-tures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fas-cinated awe, if they fail their Will saves. As with the fearaspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its alliesfrom the effects of the aura. All uses of a dragon’s awesome aura are mind-affecting effects. Hit Point Increase (Ex): At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a dragon ascendant gains 1 hit point perHit Die it possesses, including all its dragon Hit Dice andthose gained from class levels. This benefit can never in-crease a dragon’s hit points above the maximum for its HitDice and Constitution bonus. At 12th level, a dragon ascendant’s hit points are equal to the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus. Transmutation Immunity (Ex): At 3rd level, a dragon ascendant gains immunity to polymorphing, petrifica-tion, and any other attack that would alter its form. Anyshape-altering powers or spells the dragon has work nor-mally on itself. Increased Damage Reduction (Su): At 4th level, a dragon ascendant’s damage reduction can be overcome onlyby epic weapons. At 8th level, the amount of the dragon’sdamage reduction (the number before the slash) is increasedby 5. For example, an ancient black dragon/8th-level dragonascendant has damage reduction 20/epic. Lifewarding (Ex): At 6th level, a dragon ascendant is no longer vulnerable to attacks that cause energy drain, abilitydrain, or ability damage. Deflection Bonus (Su): At 7th level, a dragon ascendant gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to itsCharisma bonus, if any . Iron Mind (Ex): At 9th level, a dragon ascendant be- comes immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compul-sions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). Resistance to Fire (Ex): At 11th level, a dragon ascen- dant gains resistance to fire 20, if it does not already possessimmunity to fire. Spell Resistance (Ex): At 11th level, a dragon ascen- dant’s spell resistance increases to 33. Immortality (Ex): A 12th-level dragon ascendant is actu- ally a quasi-deity, and can no longer die from natural causes.It does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.

ELEMENTAL MASTER Dragons are creatures of raw elemental power. Two mighty forces rage within their veins: the energy that powers theirbreath weapons, and the elemental nature that forms the coreof their being. Elemental masters strive to attain the purityof perfect attunement with both of these forces. The path of the elemental master is almost exclusively pursued by true dragons, since the class requires a connec-tion to elemental and energy forces. Some dragons havelevels in other classes, commonly wizard or sorcerer, beforeadopting this prestige class, but many others do not. Elemental masters are the most solitary and reclusive of dragons, spending their lives in communion with the natu-ral forces of the universe rather than interacting with crea-tures they consider to be lesser life forms. When they docooperate with other creatures, they choose elementals andoutsiders from the elemental planes as their allies, and occa-sionally younger dragons of the same variety .",

        "description":  "An elemental master gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Element Mastery (Ex): At 1st level, an elemental master gains an additional attunement to the element type that cor-responds to its subtype. Dragons with the air or electricity subtype (including emerald, green, crystal, fang, and song dragons) gain airmastery: Any airborne creature takes a –1 penalty on attackand damage rolls made against the dragon.CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONSDragons with the earth subtype (including blue, copper, amethyst, brown, deep, and sapphire dragons) gain earthmastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damagerolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. Dragons with the fire subtype (including red, gold, and brass dragons, as well as hellfire wyrms) gain fire mastery:The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls ifboth it and its foe are touching fire or using weapons withthe flaming or flaming burst special abilities. Dragons with the water subtype (including black, bronze, and topaz dragons) gain water mastery: The dragon gains a+1 bonus on its attack and damage rolls if both it and itsopponent are touching water. Dragons with the cold subtype (silver and white dragons) gain cold mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attackand damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching ice orusing weapons with the frost or icy burst special abilities. Elemental Command (Su): An elemental master can turn or destroy creatures of the elemental subtype opposedto its own subtype, just as a good cleric turns undead. It canrebuke or command creatures of its own elemental subtype,as an evil cleric rebukes undead. The dragon can use theseabilities a total number of times per day equal to 3 + itsCharisma modifier. Air and earth are opposed elemental subtypes; fire and water are opposed. Dragons with the cold subtype canrebuke cold creatures and turn fire creatures. Energy Attunement (Ex): An elemental master is attuned to the energy type that powers its breath weapon. Dragonswith more than one breath weapon gain attunement to theone that deals energy damage, usually acid, cold, electric- ity, fire, or sonic energy . A dragon with multiple energybreath weapons can choose a single energy type it isattuned to. This ability grants the dragon no specialpowers, but determines the form of powers it gains later,including energy substitution, energy focus, energy burst,and energy storm. Energy Substitution (Ex): At 2nd level, an elemental master gains the ability to modify its spells that have anenergy descriptor so that they use the dragon’s attunedenergy instead. The substituted spell works normally in allrespects except the type of damage dealt. Summon Elemental (Sp): Once per day, starting at 2nd level, an elemental master can use its breath weapon to summon aMedium elemental corresponding to its elemental subtype.The dragon breathes as normal, but in the wake of its breaththe elemental appears, attacking in the next round. If itchooses, the dragon can instead summon an adult arrow-hawk (air or cold), average salamander (fire), adult tojanida(water), or average xorn (earth). This ability works like thesummon nature’s ally V spell, with the dragon’s class level as its caster level. A dragon with the cold subtype can summona Medium water elemental or an adult tojanida. At 5th level, an elemental master can summon one Large elemental or two Medium elementals. This ability workslike the summon nature’s ally VI spell. At 8th level, an elemental master can summon one Huge elemental, two Large elementals, or four Medium elemen-tals. Instead, the dragon can summon one elder arrowhawk,noble salamander, elder tojanida, or elder xorn, or four 93CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS Illus. by W . England An elemental master94Medium creatures of the appropriate kind. This ability works like the summon nature’s ally VII spell. At 11th level, an elemental master can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, or four Large orMedium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature’s ally VIII spell. Energy Focus (Ex): At 3rd level, an elemental master adds 1 to the save DC of spells it casts with an energy descriptorcorresponding to the dragon’s attuned energy type. This bonus increases by +1 for every additional three levels the elemental master gains (+2 at 6th level, +3 at 9thlevel, and +4 at 12th level), and it stacks with the bonus fromthe Spell Focus feat. Energy Burst (Su): A 4th-level elemental master can create a burst of damaging energy around its body . Theburst consists of energy corresponding to the dragon’s at-tuned energy type and has a radius of 5 feet per class levelof the dragon. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of dam-age per class level of the dragon. A successful Reflex save(DC 10 + dragon’s class level + its Con modifier) reduces thedamage by half. Creating an energy burst counts as a use of the dragon’s breath weapon. It cannot breathe or create another burst for1d4 rounds after creating a burst. Energy Storm (Su): A 7th-level elemental master can surround itself with a vortex of swirling energy correspon-ding to the dragon’s attuned energy type. The vortexextends from the dragon in an emanation with a radius of 5feet per class level. The effect stops attacks with thrownweapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by crea-tures inside the area, or if targeted at creatures within thearea, or if their paths take them through the area. The stormdeals 2 points of damage per class level to every unpro-tected creature within its area each round. The storm lastsfor 1 round per class level (though the dragon can dismissit as a move action), and counts as two uses of the dragon’sbreath weapon. The dragon cannot use its breath weapon(or its energy burst ability) while the storm is in place andfor 2d4 rounds after it subsides. Spell-Like Ability: At 10th level, an elemental master gains a spell-like ability associated with its elemental sub-type. An air dragon can use whirlwind, an earth dragon earthquake, a fire dragon incendiary cloud, a water dragonhorrid wilting, and a cold dragon polar ray. The dragon can use this ability three times per day, with a caster level of 20th. Elemental Qualities (Ex): A 12th-level elemental master is immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, andstunning. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking. HIDECARVED DRAGON Hidecarved dragons are members of an enigmatic order ofdragons and half-dragons. Their name comes from themarkings engraved on their scales, which grant them in-credible mystical protection. Dragons of the hidecarvedorder resemble monks in their strict discipline, dedicationto personal perfection, and mystical transcendence. Most hidecarved dragons are true dragons, since many drakes, landwyrms, wyverns, and other creatures of thedragon type lack the thick, heavy scales necessary to receivethe mystical engravings of the order. A half-dragon canbecome a hidecarved dragon only if its nondragon parenthad very significant natural armor, although some half-dragon/half-giants have been known to use magic to thickentheir hides sufficiently to qualify for the class. Some dragonsadvance in other classes—commonly monk, wizard, sorcerer,or cleric—before adopting this prestige class, primarily tomeet the minimum base Will save requirement. Hidecarved dragons do not build monasteries, but they do gather in small groups called “lauths.” These tiny com-munities of three to five dragons share a large territory andcome together only occasionally, but will gather quickly tohelp if one member of the lauth is threatened.",

SACRED WARDER OF BAHAMUT Among dragon clerics of Bahamut, some are moved prima-rily by compassion for those who suffer from the depreda-tions of evil dragons. These clerics adopt the sacred warderof Bahamut prestige class, shaping their identities aroundthe idea of protecting those who cannot hope to protectthemselves from the awesome power of Tiamat’s brood. Sacred warders of Bahamut are usually gold or silver drag- ons with some levels in the cleric class. Good half-dragonsare surprisingly common among the ranks of the sacredwarders, and they find more acceptance there than in mostother dragon groups and organizations. Sacred wardersoften possess some levels of paladin as well as cleric; otherclasses are rare. Sacred warders can be found anywhere evil dragons threaten other creatures. Their usually lawful alignmentinclines them to cooperate with other creatures. They some-times operate in pairs, but more often work with groups ofhumanoids or other creatures drawn from the communitiesthey try to protect.",

It does not,however, gain any other benefit a character of that classwould have gained (an improved chance of turning orrebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentiallymeans that the dragon adds the level of sacred warder to thelevel of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has,then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly . If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a sacred warder, the dragon must decide towhich class it adds each level of sacred warder for the pur-pose of determining spells per day . A very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level sacred warder has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in theprestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added toits effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old golddragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spell-casting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a17th-level cleric. Aura of Courage (Ex): At 3rd level, a sacred warder becomes immune to fear effects. In addition, the dragon’sfrightful presence ability alters so that it inspires allies aswell as striking terror into enemies. Allies within the radiusof the dragon’s aura (30 feet ×its age category) are unaffected by the dragon’s frightful presence and receive a morale bonuson their saving throws against fear equal to the dragon’s classlevel + its Cha modifier. Allies within the aura cannot bepanicked by an evil dragon’s frightful presence, regardless oftheir Hit Dice. Enemies within the aura are affected normally by the dragon’s frightful presence. Sacred Shield (Su): At 7th level, a sacred warder gains the ability to surround itself with a protective aura that lasts 10minutes and protects the dragon’s body and equipment fromattacks. The shield absorbs 10 points of damage per class level.Once the shield absorbs that much damage, it collapses. Thedamage can be from any source—weapons, spells, any energytype, and so on. Damage the dragon would not take anyway(fire damage against a gold dragon, for example, or weapondamage blocked by the dragon’s damage reduction) does notcount against the damage absorbed by the shield. The dragoncan use this ability three times per day . Area Sacred Shield (Su): At 12th level, a sacred warder of Bahamut can extend its sacred shield to protect an areawith a radius of 30 feet. The dragon can place the barrieranywhere within its line of sight, and can choose to makeit mobile with respect to an unattended object or willingcreature (including the dragon itself ). The shield blocks incoming attacks, but creatures inside the shield can stillattack out through the shield. UNHOLY RAVAGER OF TIAMAT The goddess of evil dragons and of conquest, Tiamat claimssome allegiance from every evil dragon. Those who devotethemselves entirely to her cause, however, are among themost fearsome forces of evil in the world, living embodi-ments of her destructive power. Unholy ravagers of Tiamatare dragon clerics that hope to attain a sliver of their deity’smighty power while aspiring to none of Tiamat’s subtletyand sophistication. Unholy ravagers live only to destroy, andwhen they set their minds on destruction, no stone is leftstanding on another when they are finished. Unholy ravagers of Tiamat are usually blue or green drag- ons with some levels of cleric. Though red dragons are bornwith a strong hereditary predisposition to chaos, a numberof them stray from that alignment and end up as neutral evilunholy ravagers. An unholy ravager typically works alone, but may drive marauding hordes of kobolds, lizardfolk, or hobgoblinsahead of itself to soften up the opposition—or lull its foesinto overconfidence.",

Aura of Despair (Su): At 3rd level, an unholy ravager’s frightful presence alters slightly . In addition to the fear effect, creatures within the radius of the dragon’s frightfulCHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONS A sacred warder of Bahamut protects innocents from an unholy ravager of Tiamat.presence take a –2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty is applied before creatures roll their saving throws againstthe frightful presence effect itself. Profane Blast (Su): At 7th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat can unleash a narrow blast of raw profane energy fromits mouth three times per day . The blast is a ray, requiring aranged touch attack, with a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per classlevel. The blast looks and feels like energy of the same typeas the dragon’s breath weapon. If it hits a target, it deals thesame number of dice worth of damage as the dragon’s breathweapon, but uses d12s. (So, a great wyrm blue dragon woulddeal 24d12 points of damage with its profane blast.) Thedamage it deals results directly from divine power and istherefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy and similar magic. Each use of this ability counts as a use of the dragon’s breath weapon, so it cannot use its breathweapon for 1d4 rounds after issuing a profane blast. An unholy ravager can target a creature behind a wall of force, prismatic wall, orprismatic sphere with its profane blast. The dragon makes a special dispel check, rolling 1d20 + itsage category + its class level against a DC of 11 + the effect’scaster level. If this check is successful, the effect is instantlynegated (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed) andthe ray goes on to strike the intended target (if the rangedtouch attack roll is successful). A profane blast is stoppednormally by a sacred warder of Bahamut’s sacred shield. Mass Profane Blast (Su): At 12th level, an unholy rav- ager of Tiamat’s profane blast occupies the same area as itsbreath weapon and affects all creatures within that area. Thedragon can choose whether to use a ray profane blast or amass profane blast, and can use both abilities no more thana total of three times per day . If a wall of force or prismatic effect is within the area of a mass profane blast, the dragon makes a special dispel checkas described above for each such effect within the area. ADVANCED DRAGONS The advancement rules in the Monster Manual allow drag- ons theoretically infinite progression even beyond thestatistics of great wyrm. This book lets dragons improvemore than their Hit Dice as they progress to unparalleledheights of power.Age Category: A standard dragon gains one “virtual age category” for every 3 Hit Dice it gains beyond the greatwyrm stage. A 61 HD red dragon, with 21 more Hit Dicethan a standard great wyrm, has gained seven virtual agecategories, meaning its effective age category is nineteen.Abilities that function once per day per age category or oth-erwise use the dragon’s age category as part of a calculationuse this adjusted number.",

        "description":  "One important element of dragon advancement is increasing size. The dragons that don’t reach Colossal size bythe great wyrm stage can never reach it according to thestandard advancement rules. When advancing a dragon,consider its basic size group: smaller (black, brass, copper,and white dragons), normal (blue, bronze, and green drag-ons), or larger (gold, red, and silver dragons). A dragon thatis Tiny as a wyrmling is in the smaller group, a dragon thatis Small as a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size is inthe normal group, and a dragon that is Small to Large as awyrmling and reaches Colossal by the great wyrm stage is inthe larger group. A smaller-sized dragon becomes Colossal when it gains two age categories (+6 HD) beyond great wyrm. It increasesto Colossal+ (see below) when it gains an additional four agecategories (+18 HD total). Thus, a white great wyrm reachesColossal size at 42 HD and Colossal+ at 54 HD, while a brassgreat wyrm becomes Colossal at 43 HD and Colossal+ at55 HD. A normal-sized dragon becomes Colossal when it gains one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increasesto Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories(+15 HD total). Thus, a green great wyrm reaches Colossalsize at 41 HD and Colossal+ size at 53 HD, while a bronzedragon becomes Colossal at 42 HD and Colossal+ at 54 HD. A larger-sized dragon becomes Colossal+ when it gains four age categories (12 HD) more than it needed to reachthe Colossal size. Thus, a silver or red dragon becomesColossal+ at 52 HD, and a gold dragon becomes Colossal+ at53 HD. Colossal+ Size: Although there is no size category larger than Colossal, the largest advanced dragons have a greaterreach and deal more damage with their attacks than otherColossal dragons. These dragons are said to be of Colossal+(“Colossal plus”) size. 99CHAPTER 2: A DM’S GUIDE TO DRAGONSTable 2–11: The Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Base Fort Ref Will Level Attack Bonus Save Save Save Special Spellcasting 1st +1 +2 +0 +2 Divine conversion, smite — 2nd +2 +3 +0 +3 Breath weapon substitution +1 level of existing class 3rd +3 +3 +1 +3 Aura of despair +1 level of existing class 4th +4 +4 +1 +4 Smite 2/day +1 level of existing class5th +5 +4 +1 +4 +1 level of existing class 6th +6 +5 +2 +5 +1 level of existing class7th +7 +5 +2 +5 Profane blast +1 level of existing class 8th +8 +6 +2 +6 Smite 3/day +1 level of existing class9th +9 +6 +3 +6 +1 level of existing class 10th +10 +7 +3 +7 +1 level of existing class 11th +11 +7 +3 +7 +1 level of existing class 12th +12 +8 +4 +8 Mass profane blast, smite 4/day +1 level of existing class100A Colossal+ dragon has a space of 30 feet, like any other Colossal dragon, but its reach is 10 feet longer than normalwith each attack form, and it has a proportionately longertail slap and tail sweep.

It’s likely the strongest foe he’ll ever fight, as well as the smartest. The typical dragon has every conceivable advantage over an average group of adventurers, and then some. Any character who even thinks about fighting a dragon should have his head examined. All of that is what dragons (and DMs) want players to think. They count on intimidating players (and their char-acters) before they even set out on the hunt. This chapteris designed for those characters brave enough to disregardthe dire warnings, the lurid stories, and even commonsense itself. This chapter is for dragonslayers . This chapter also holds information for those who count a dragon among their allies—whether as cohort, mount, orfamiliar, as trusted ally or contact, or even as master. FIGHTING A DRAGON A dragon brings significant advantages to any combat—mobility, ranged attacks, keen senses, intelligence, dura-bility, and, of course, the ability to deal out tremendousquantities of damage. Here are some tips for the would-bedragonslayer on how to even the odds. FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED Before you even think about fighting a dragon, do yourresearch. Confirm the dragon’s kind, age, and any otherrelevant factors before gearing up. Particularly if your DM utilizes dragons beyond those in the Monster Manual , it’s not enough just to know that the dragon has “dark scales” or “breathes fire.” Start with mundane methods, such as Gather Information or bardic knowledge. Once you have afew good leads, divination magic is the way to go.Low-level dragonhunters can use augury orclairau- dience to gain important clues, while more powerful characters can employ divination orcommune to answer important questions and arcane eye ,scrying , or even ethereal jaunt to scout out a dragon’s lair before walking in. Sure, the dragon is likely todetect your spying attempt, but that doesn’t meanit knows who’s coming or when you’ll arrive. Once you know what you’re up against, stock up on appropriate offensive and defensive items.Assuming such is an option, don’t hesitate to pickup scrolls or potions of resist energy orprotection from energy to help offset breath weapon effects. Throw in an appropriate wand or batch of scrollswith the right attack spells ( fireball ,cone of cold , and the like), and you’re on your way to victory . LIMIT THE BATTLEFIELD If at all possible, you should never battle adragon in any area where it can take full 101Illus. by J. J arvis102advantage of its flight (or swimming) capability . Fighting a dragon in a large cavern (or worse yet, outdoors) is a strategydestined to fail. You can try to lure a dragon into cramped corridors or other small areas, but only the least intelligent will fall forthis trick. Instead, use spells and common sense to alter thebattlefield conditions as you go. Spells such as slow orearth- bind (a new spell described on page 112) can limit a dragon’s mobility . Control water takes away the black dragon’s favorite hiding place. W all of stone ,blade barrier , and similar spells can drastically change the layout of a battle. Alternatively, you can take the fight to the dragon with spells such as fly,air walk , or water breathing . But keep in mind that the dragon is more adept at moving in the air (orwater) than you do. The dragon’s reach is closely connected to its mobility . Try to avoid charging through its threatened area and givingthe dragon too many free attacks—the dragon doesn’t needany more advantages. Use Mobility and Spring Attack todecrease or neutralize the effect of the dragon’s reach; bar-ring that, arm yourself with a longspear or some otherreach weapon. Even if you can’t take advantage of any of these techniques, at least stay mobile during the fight. Assuming you’re fight-ing in the dragon’s lair, it knows the terrain much better thanyou do, and if you sit in the same place lobbing fireball after fireball , rest assured that the dragon will come to you. Use “shoot-and-scoot” techniques, such as those offered by Shoton the Run, so that the dragon can’t plan its attack routinestoo far in advance. Movement-enhancing spells such as expe- ditious retreat ,longstrider , and haste can help counteract the dragon’s speed. Since darkness is a dragon’s best friend, don’t hesitate to light up the battlefield. Light and continual flame work rea- sonably well, but there’s no substitute for the daylight spell, with its 60-foot radius of bright light. If the dragonsupplements darkness with fog or mist, a gust of wind spell can also negate its advantage. THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE While it’s extraordinarily difficult to sneak up ona dragon, thanks to its scent, darkvision, low-lightvision, and blindsense abilities, it doesn’t hurt to keepa low profile for as long as possible. Don’t just trudgedown the hallway, stand outside casting spells, then kickin the door—by now the dragon not only knows you andyour companions are there, it has probably figured out yourraces, classes, and favorite breakfast foods. Use silence or, if you’re lucky enough to have a bard along, sculpt sound to muffle your approach. Though invisibility probably won’t work against the dragon, it might protectyou from any guardians it has stationed outside its lair (seebelow). Hide from dragons (a new spell described on page 113) can even help you defeat its blindsense. Dragons are smart, and they often bargain with other creatures to guard their lairs or supplement their owndefenses with traps or spells. Use that augury ordivination scroll you’ve been carrying around to determine the bestpath of approach, with an eye toward bypassing rather than overcoming the dragon’s defenses. If you have access to it,find the path is perfect for this job. Sure, you might be able to mow through the ogres at the cavern entrance withoutbreaking a sweat, but once the carnage begins, the dragonknows you’re coming. SPREAD OUT, CONCENTRATE ATTACKS Of course, one drawback to fighting a dragon in an enclosedarea (hey, no plan is perfect) is that the dragon can probablytarget more characters with its breath weapon. Don’t bunchup—to the dragon, three characters are a target, but one isprobably a waste of a breath. When fighting dragons withline-shaped breath weapons (such as black or blue dragons),for Pelor’s sake, don’t all stand in the same corridor. But it’s not only the dragon’s breath weapon that a group of characters must worry about. A dragon’s full attack rou-tine is devastating, and as tempting as it is to encourage adragon to “split up” its attacks between multiple PCs, mostdragons focus their physical attacks on a single targetuntil that target is down. If your fighter is likely to beturned into dragon chow anyway, there’s no point in stand-ing nearby and letting the dragonuse its Cleave feat, tail sweep, orany leftover attacks on you.That may sound a bit harsh,but healing fighters is whatclerics are for. That said, there may be reasons toCHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVE A ranger examines a dragon’sfootprint—unaware that he’spartially in theshadow of the samedragon’s wing.stick together, at least for a while. Staying close to the pal- adin means you’re more likely to resist the dragon’s frightfulpresence, at the risk of being vulnerable to a breath weaponattack. If you’re relying on a magic circle against evil ,antimagic field , or similar emanation, don’t go running off by yourself. If you plan to flank the dragon—and a rogue shouldn’t be inthe fight for any other reason—stay close enough to get intocombat with a single move. Spreading out your forces doesn’t mean you can’t concen- trate your firepower. Once the battle begins, hit the dragonwith everything you have, and don’t hold back. Don’t wasteyour time on the dragon’s minions (unless they prevent youfrom targeting the dragon)—you can deal with them afterthe dragon is dead, assuming they stick around. In following this tip, fighters often make the mistake of thinking that it’s most important to use a full attack againstthe dragon. Chances are that the dragon’s full attack is moredevastating than yours, and anyway, your second, third, orfourth attack in the round may not even have much likeli-hood of hitting. There’s no shame in making only a singleattack and then falling back to a safe distance (particularly ifyou can do so without provoking attacks of opportunity).Just be sure to make that one attack count, with tactics suchas a charge, the Power Attack feat, a smite ability, and the like. DON’T STAY TOO LONG Regardless of your good tactics, you may find yourself in abattle you simply can’t win. Remember that, particularlyagainst dragons, discretion is the better part of valor. Ifyou’ve lost or are in imminent danger of losing a key partymember (such as the cleric who’s keeping you alive, thewizard who’s blasting the dragon with spells, or the fighterwho’s keeping the dragon from munching the rest of theparty), strongly consider falling back to return another day .Plus, you’re now better informed about your foe, allowingyou to prepare more effectively . Don’t waste too much time recuperating, though. The longer you stay away, the more rested and ready the dragonis likely to be when you return. FEATS Characters who find themselves interacting with dragons—whether as friend or foe—may find the feats in this sectionvery useful. Some even let a character mimic the innatepower of dragons. These feats are described below in alphabetical order, using the format described on page 89 of the Player’s Hand- book. See Table 3–1 for a summary of these feats, their pre- requisites, and their benefits.

For example, red dragon armor isimpervious to fire. The character wearing the armor doesnot benefit from this property . DRAGONCRAFT ITEMS Dragoncraft items are nonmagical objects made from spe-cific parts of a true dragon’s body . Only a character with theDragoncrafter feat (see page 105) can create dragoncraftitems. They derive special powers from their origin, as wellas from the skill of the person crafting them. Creating a dragoncraft item is much like creating a master- work weapon or similar item. In addition to the item itself(which may also include a masterwork component, if it is aweapon, shield, or suit of armor), the character must “create”the dragoncraft component. A dragoncraft component has a price that varies based on the specific item (see item descriptions below). The CraftDC for creating a dragoncraft component is 25. Only afterall components of a dragoncraft item are completed is theitem considered finished. Since dragoncraft items aren’t magical, they don’t lose their powers in an antimagic field or similar area. For those effects that require a caster level, treat the caster level as3rd or the lowest level possible to cast the spell in ques-tion, whichever is higher. The powers of dragoncraft itemsdon’t stack with similar or identical effects, as noted in thespecific item descriptions below. You can add magical qual- ities to a dragoncraft item (including enhancement bonusesfor items such as weapons and armor) at the normal price,but only if you possess the Dragoncrafter feat (in addition toany other prerequisites). Several dragoncraft items are described below. The descrip- tion of each item gives a dragoncraft price, dragon part, andskill, as defined here.",

        "description":  "A dragonkith gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Scales (Ex): A dragonkith, over time, develops crusty scales the same color as her dragon companion. At 1st level,this protection adds +1 to the natural armor bonus of thedragonkith, and its natural armor bonus improves by anadditional +1 every three levels. If the dragonkith alreadyhas natural armor as an aspect of its creature kind (and notfrom a spell or magic item), this bonus stacks with its exist-ing natural armor bonus. Telepathic Plea (Su): Wherever a dragonkith is, its dragon companion can send an instantaneous, telepathicplea for help at any time. No details are provided in the mes-sage, other than that the dragon is in danger. This commu-nication does not work both ways (the dragonkith cannotalert the dragon). Mighty Attack (Su): At 2nd level, once per day, a dragon- kith can call upon its dragon’s might to deal an extra 1d6points of damage on a single attack. The dragonkith mustdecide before an attack is resolved whether it will use thispower. If the attack misses, that use of the mighty attackis wasted. For every three levels beyond 2nd, the damageincreases by another 1d6. Detect Treasure (Sp): Once per day, a dragonkith of 3rd level or higher can use a detect treasure ability . This works like the detect magic spell, except that it senses Medium or smaller objects that are worth more than 100 gp. On the firstround, the dragonkith detects the presence of such objects;on the second round, the power reveals the number ofobjects and the location of each. In each subsequent round,the dragonkith can make an Appraise check to estimate thevalue of one object. Energy Resistance (Su): A dragonkith develops an ever stronger resistance to the energy associated with its dragoncompanion’s breath weapon. Beginning at 3rd level, it canignore some damage of the type generated by its dragoncompanion’s breath weapon. This ability applies to sourcesof the energy type other than the dragon companion’s breathweapon. Thus, a dragonkith with a red dragon companiongains resistance to fire 5 at 3rd level, effective against firefrom any source. This resistance improves to 10 at 7th leveland to 15 at 9th level. In the case of dragons with multiplebreath weapons, the dragonkith gains resistance to one type of damaging breath. Telepathic Link (Su): At 4th level, a dragonkith develops a telepathic link with its companion dragon out to a dis-tance of up to 1 mile. The dragonkith and dragon can com-municate telepathically . Because of this link, one has thesame connection to an item or place that the other does. Forinstance, if the dragonkith has seen a room, its dragon com-panion can teleport into that room as if she had seen it too. Sorcerous Knack (Sp): At 6th level, a dragonkith acquires the ability to cast a single arcane spell once per day as a sor-cerer of its class level. The dragonkith must choose a spellknown to its dragon companion, and it must have a Cha-risma score of at least 10 + the spell’s level to use the spell bymeans of the sorcerous knack ability . Once the spell is chosen, that decision can never be changed. Share Spells (Su): At either the dragon’s or the dragon- kith’s option, any spell one casts on itself also affects the other.The two must be touching at the time. If the spell has a dura-tion other than instantaneous, the spell stops affecting themif they move farther than 100 feet apart. The spell’s effectwill not be restored even if they return to each other beforethe duration would otherwise have ended. The dragon anddragonkith can share spells even if the spells normally donot affect creatures of their respective types. DRAGONRIDER Some dream of soaring through the clouds atop a mightydraconic steed, feeling the wind on their faces, afraid ofnothing. The dragonrider doesn’t simply dream of thislife—he leads it. Characters of all classes may become dragonriders, though the most common are barbarians, fighters, paladins,and rangers. Other characters looking to follow this pathoften pick up a level of one of these classes first, to gain theriding talent necessary . An NPC dragonrider might be encountered as a solitary ally of a family of dragons or as part of a larger fighting force,perhaps affiliated with a kingdom or city-state that usesdragons as part of its defenses.",

DRAGONSLAYER They come from all walks of life, from all cultures and soci- eties. They may be poor or wealthy, strong or wise, good or evil, skilled with blade or spell. But all dragonslayers share a sin- gular courage and strength of heart— a necessary commodity in their line of work. Characters of any class may pursue the path of the dragonslayer. Fight- ers, barbarians, and paladins enjoy the class’s increased combat prow- ess against these powerful ene- mies. Sorcerers, clerics, wizards, and druids can continue to improve their spellcasting ability while gain- ing new powers suitable for use in battling dragons. Even bards, monks, rangers, and rogues have much to gain from this class, though the dragonstalker class (see below) is often more their style. Multi- class characters, such as fighter/ sorcerers or barbarian/clerics, can make particu- larly good dragonslayers, bringing a variety of tal- ents to the task. NPC dragonslayers have few close associates who aren’t as skilled as they are in the art of battling dragons.

This essen-tially means that the character adds the level of dragon-slayer to the level of whatever spellcasting class thecharacter has, then d etermines spells per day and caster level accordingly . If a character takes one or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in one or more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the dragonslayer class that he has not already attained. For example, a 5th-level fighter/1st-level dragonslayer does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 1st-level dragonslayer because he did not belong to a spellcasting class before taking a level in the prestige class.

Hunting Bonus (Ex): Starting at 1st level, a dragon- stalker gains a bonus equal to her class level on Bluff, Listen,Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks when using theseskills against dragons. Sneak Attack (Dragon): Beginning at 2nd level, if a dragonstalker catches a dragon when it is unable to defenditself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spotfor extra damage. Basi-cally, any time the dragon-stalker’s target would bedenied its Dexterity bonusto AC (whether it actuallyhas a Dexterity bonus ornot), the dragonstalker’sattack deals an extra 2d6points of damage. Thisextra damage increases by2d6 points every other level(4d6 at 4th level, 6d6 at 6thlevel, and so on). Should thedragonstalker score a criticalhit with a sneak attack, thisextra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and pene- tration to hit a vital spot, soranged attacks can onlycount as sneak attacks ifthe dragon is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dragonstalker can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethaldamage instead of lethal damage. She cannotuse a weapon that deals lethal damage to dealnonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not evenwith the usual –4 penalty, because she mustmake optimal use of her weapon to execute thesneak attack. A dragonstalker can only sneak attack living dragons with discernible anatomies. Any dragonimmune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the dragonstalker must be able to see the target wellenough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach avital spot. A dragonstalker cannot sneak attack while strik-ing at a dragon with concealment or by striking the limbs ofa dragon whose vitals are beyond reach. If a dragonstalker gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stackwhen the ability is used against dragons. Ignore Natural Armor (Ex): Once per day, a dragonstalker of 3rd level or higher can ignore a target’s natural armorbonus (including any enhancement to that natural armor) forone attack (melee or ranged). You must declare that you areusing this ability before you make the attack roll. At 7th level,a dragonstalker can use this ability twice per day . Hide Scent (Ex): At 5th level, a dragonstalker can use the Disguise skill to hide her (or someone else’s) scent. This requires a Disguise check (with a –10 penalty) opposed by a Wisdom check made by any creature attempting to use the scent abil- ity to discover the dragonstalker’s presence. Hiding one’s scent requires twice as long as a typical Disguise check (1d3 ×20 minutes), and the effect lasts for 1 hour per class level. Magic that alters your form doesn’t affect this Disguise check. Foil Blindsense (Su): Once per day, a 9th-level dragonstalker can render herself completely imperceptible to blindsense. This requires a standard action, and the effect lasts for 10 min- utes. This ability has no effect on other forms of vision (whether mundane or magical). For instance, it doesn’t keep someone from spotting or hearing the dragon- stalker with normal senses, or from noticing an invisible dragonstalker by means of a true seeing spell.

Burglars steal baubles and trinkets. If Iwanted trinkets, I’ d rob a dwarf. I want tr easur e.” —Liam Boldfingers, halfling hoardstealer The hoardstealer specializes in relieving wealthy individu- als from large amounts of said wealth. In most cases, theseindividuals are dragons, since few creatures keep so muchwealth in one place. Stealing a dragon’s hoard is a challeng-ing task, to be sure, but if it were easy, it probably wouldn’tbe worth doing. Most hoardstealers are rogues, though some bards and rangers can become hoardstealers with the right training.Other classes may fancy themselves treasure-finders, butthey don’t have the aptitudes to take up the art of hoard-stealing. By their very nature, most NPC hoardstealers work alone. Some may recruit assistance for tough jobs—such as roguesor other stealthy sorts—but a hoardstealer rarely sees suchhired help as anything but expendable assets. The smarthoardstealer knows that he can only count on himself to getthe job done—everyone else is just an amateur.",

Evasion (Ex): An initiate of the draconic mysteries can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility . If an initiate makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a save (such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a fireball ), the initiate instead takes no damage. Evasion can only be used if the initiate is wearing lightarmor or no armor. Claws of the Dragon (Su): At 2nd level, the unarmed strike of an initiate of the draconic mysteries is empoweredwith draconic might. The initiate’s unarmed strike can over-come damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon. In addition, the unarmed strikes of an initiate of the dra- conic mysteries may deal slashing damage, at her option.Such damage cannot be nonlethal damage. Keen Senses (Ex): At 3rd level, an initiate gains dark- vision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. Increased Unarmed Damage (Ex): At 4th level, the damage dealt by an initiate’s unarmed attacks increases byone die step (such as from 1d3 to 1d4, or from 1d8 to 1d10).At 8th level, it increases another die step. Frightful Presence (Ex): A 5th-level initiate of the dra- conic mysteries can unsettle foes with her mere presence. The initiate can activate her frightful presence as a free action.

Spell Resistance (Su): Beginning at 7th level, an initiate of the draconic mysteries gains spell resistance equal to 15 +her class level. Deadly Strike (Su): A 9th-level initiate deals triple dam- age on a critical hit inflicted by her unarmed strike, regard-less of whether it dealt bludgeoning or slashing damage. Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 9th level, an initi- ate no longer takes ability score penalties for aging (seeTable 6–5: Aging Effects, page 109 of the Player’s Handbook ) and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may havealready taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses stillaccrue, and the initiate still dies of old age when her timeis up. Dragon Shape (Su): At 10th level, an initiate of the dra- conic mysteries gains the ability to use a shapechange ability once per day to take the form of a dragon, from Tiny to Hugesize, for 1 hour. Once a form is assumed, it cannot bechanged except to return to normal (which dismisses theeffect).

PLATINUM KNIGHT The platinum knight protects good-aligned dragonkindfrom their natural enemies, the chromatic dragons, as wellas any others who would prey upon these noble creatures.Bahamut, Lord of the Good Dragons, is his patron, while theminions of Tiamat are his mortal foes. Paladins, clerics, and fighters are the most common plat- inum knights. Of course, any good-aligned character whocounts himself an ally of dragonkind can pursue this class,and has much to gain from it. NPC platinum knights often work with other good- aligned beings, including dragons, celestials, paladins, and,of course, characters of other classes who share their out-look. They do not hesitate to recruit assistance when facingpowerful evil dragons, but voluntarily associate only withother good characters.",

Even the smallest dragon brings sharpsenses and great mobility to the table, probably far beyondthe capabilities of any of the other player characters. While it’s true that a dragon that adventures with PCs can change the game, with a few safeguards in place, the DMshould be able to feel comfortable about this addition. Thissection details many of the most common methods of incor-porating a dragon into a group of PCs, and provides the DMwith guidelines to control the ramifications of that addition. All of these options depend on your DM’s permission. If you want to add a dragon to your group, work with your DM toensure that this addition will fit smoothly into the campaign. DRAGONS’ ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES While many players look at a dragon and see only its claws, teeth, and breath weapon, these abilities are among the leastsignificant as far as “game balance” goes. After all, most char-acters can deal plenty of damage by means of attacks or mag-ical effects. Instead, it’s the dragon’s less spectacular abilities, such as blindsense and flight, that make it potentially “too power-ful” as a member of an adventuring group. Here are sometips on how to handle those abilities in your game, as well asnotes on some disadvantages that a draconic charactermight encounter.",

DRAGONS AS PLAYER CHARACTERS A very different campaign model features dragons most prominently in the game by allowing players to run dragoncharacters, either a single character in a party made up pri-marily of standard races, or in an entire party of dragons.Depending on the tone and level of the campaign, thesepowerful PCs can engage in traditional sorts of adventures,or they can concern themselves with epic quests, believingthat more mundane tasks are beneath them. In one effective campaign model, each player has two active characters in the campaign: a dragon and a member ofa standard race who is bonded to the dragon as a kindred.Some adventures, particularly those involving treks intodungeons and cramped tunnels where a dragon can’t bring 141CHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVE Illus. by G.

Other adventures, especially those with a moreepic sweep, bring the dragon PCs into the action. If you adopt this campaign model, consider awarding experience points to both characters whenever either char-acter adventures. Each time an active character gains XP ,the inactive character receives an award equal to 25% ofthe award the active character gets. Dragon kindred share a special emotional bond with the dragon character; this bond is bestreflected by the dragonkith prestige class(see page 123). Kindred do not need toadopt this prestige class, but manyadvance at least a few levels in it,once they qualify . A different way to focus on dragons as player charactersis to use characters from thestandard races, but with thehalf-dragon template ap-plied. Such characters canmake use of much of thematerial presented in thisbook, without straying sofar from the boundariesof what “normal” D\u0026Dcharacters can do. See thehalf-dragon template onpage 146 of the Monster Manual and the half- dragon entry in Chapter4 of this book (page 166). Advancement and Aging A dragon PC be-gins at a specifiedage (in accordancewith the currentparty level in thecampaign) and gains character levels as the player wishesover the course of its adventures. As it ages from wyrmlingto juvenile, a true dragon’s level adjustment varies between+2 and +6, depending on the age and dragon variety . For adragon PC, the dragon’s Hit Dice and class levels plus thislevel adjustment is its effective character level (ECL). For astarting character of juvenile or younger age, this ECL issomewhere between 5 and 20. As it ages, as shown on Table 3–21: Aging for Dragon PCs, the dragon is required to devote a level every few years to itsdragon “class,” reflecting the extra Hit Die or level adjust-ment it gains from aging. The character must add thisdragon level as the first level it gains after reaching an ageshown on the table. It gains no benefit from reaching a newage category until it attains this level. Most of the time, a dragon character who advances a dragon level gains 1 Hit Die (1d12), 1 point of natural armorbonus, and 1 point of base attack bonus. Every two increasedHit Dice translate to an increased base save bonus and increased save DCs for the dragon’s special abilities. Once in a while, a dragon character must advance a dragon level without gaining a Hit Die, base attack bonusor save bonus increase, or any other tangible benefit. Theselevels are indicated on Table 3–21 by asterisks in the “Age inYears” column: When the dragon reaches the specified age,the next level the character attains must be used to advanceits dragon level. When this occurs, its level adjustmentincreases (and its ECL rises accordingly) but the characterreceives no other benefits. These “extraneous levels”smooth the transitions between age categories, which areoften accompanied by an increase in level adjustment toaccount for changes in size, ability scores, and other char-acteristics. In most cases on Table 3–21, a dragon PC that isclose to reaching a new age category has a higher level adjustment than is specified for its age category and kind in the Monster Manual. This method of transitioning between age cat- egories ensures that a dragon PC does not make rapid jumps in power out of proportion to its ECL by reaching a new age category and gaining the benefits of as many as three effective character levels at once (as, for example, a young white dragon with 11 HD and a level adjustment of +3 would do when advancing to the juvenile age category with 12 HD and a level adjustment of +5). When a dragon reaches a new age category, its abil- ity scores improve across the board. When a dragon’s Intelligence score in- creases due to aging, it gains additional skill points for its new Intelligence score retroactively, in contrast tothe standard rules governing character advancement. Each+2 increase in Intelligence gives the character an addi-tional 1 skill point per dragon HD, which translates to anew skill at 1 rank per dragon HD (if it is a class skill) or 1/2rank per dragon HD (for cross-class skills). The dragon doesnot get additional skill points for any class levels it pos-sesses, nor does it gain retroactive skill points when itsIntelligence increases through other means (such as a head- band of intellect or an ability score increase gained as part of character advancement). For example, Simon is creating a gold dragon PC to join a party of 13th-level characters. His character, Keryst, beginsplay as a newborn wyrmling dragon, with 8 dragon HitDice and a level adjustment of +4, plus one level of paladin,for a total effective character level (ECL) of 13th. Keryst has8d12 Hit Dice from his dragon heritage plus 1d10 from hispaladin level, has +7 natural armor, and possesses all theCHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVEThis wyrmling gold dragon adventures alongside a 13th-level paladin.other abilities typical of wyrmling gold dragons and 1st- level paladins.

Keryst gains two levels as a paladin before reaching his second birthday . Before adding his next dragon level, he stillhas 8d12 dragon Hit Dice, and now has 3d10 paladin HitDice.

His ECL is now 18. Two more years pass and Keryst gains one more paladin level, making him a 5th-level paladin and a 19th-level charac-ter. Now he turns 5 and must add another dragon level—butthis one does not gain him an additional Hit Die. He still has10d12 dragon Hit Dice and 5d10 paladin Hit Dice, but hislevel adjustment is now +5, making him a 20th-level character. When Keryst turns 6, he becomes a very young dragon and he must advance another dragon level. His dragon HitDice increase to 11d12, he is still a 5th-level paladin, and hislevel adjustment is still +5, so he is now a 21st-level charac-ter. In addition to the base attack bonus and natural armorbonus increases for his greater dragon Hit Dice, he gains theabilities of a very young dragon: His breath weapon damageincreases to 4d10, and his ability scores increase as follows:Str +4, Con +2, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. His increased Intelli-gence score grants him an additional 11 skill points, whichhe can use to gain a class skill (for his dragon “class”) at 11ranks or a cross-class skill at 5 1/2 ranks. Other True Dragons For true dragons other than those found in the Monster Manual, construct tables such as those above using the infor- mation on Table 3–22: Additional Level Adjustments.On the table, Hit Dice and Level Adjustment are given for wyrmling, very young, (usually) young, and (some-times) juvenile dragons. For example, a sapphire dragon has 5 HD and a level adjustment of +2 as a wyrmling, 8 HD and a level adjust-ment of +3 when it reaches the very young stage, 11 HDand a level adjustment of +4 at the young stage, and 15HD and a level adjustment of +4 as a juvenile. Its progres-sion is identical to that of a copper dragon. If the sum of a dragon’s Hit Dice and its level adjustment gives it an effective character level higher than 20, thatdragon character is too powerful to fit into a party of PCsbelow epic level. For instance, a howling dragon has 9 HDand a level adjustment of +4 as a wyrmling and 12 HD and alevel adjustment of +5 as a very young dragon. When itreaches young age, it has 15 HD and a +6 level adjustment,giving it an ECL of 21; thus, information on a young howl-ing dragon as a PC is absent from Table 3–22. Also, all lung dragons are yu lung for their first 25 years of life (through the young age category). When a yu lungreaches juvenile age, it transforms into a different variety ofdragon. Because of their high juvenile Hit Dice and leveladjustment, many lung dragons have ECLs higher than 20at the juvenile stage and thus are not mentioned on thistable. These varieties include the shen lung, chiang lung,tun mi lung, lung wang, and t’ien lung. The Hit Dice andlevel adjustment listings for the pan lung and li lung are forjuveniles only . Lesser Dragon PCs Using another creature of the dragon type as a player char-acter is rather less complicated than using a true dragon.Such a creature has a set level adjustment and no built-inprogression due to age, so after the character begins playthere is no reason to advance the character as a monsteragain. For example, a wyvern character, with a level adjust-ment of +4 and 7 Hit Dice, has an ECL of 11 and joins aparty of 11th-level characters to adventure. The wyverncontinues advancing as a character, just like the other char-acters in the party . Many creatures of the dragon type have more than 20 Hit Dice, or their level adjustment would raise their ECLabove 20. These monsters are not included in the follow-ing information.CHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVE Lesser Dragon Level Adj.

        "description":  "+5 The abyssal drake is the horrific result of an ancient breeding program that combines thenastiest elements of demons, wyverns, and reddragons. Originally intended to serve as mountsfor mighty demon princes, abyssal drakes provedtoo unruly for such service. Now they roam thewilds of the Abyss, preying on demons and vis-itors alike. Abyssal drakes resemble their wyvern ancestors, but their dark red, scaled hidesbetray their fiendish heritage. They have power-ful batlike wings, a serpentine neck, and razor-sharp claws. Abyssal drakes speak Abyssal and Common. 145Illus. by L. Grant-W est146COMBAT An abyssal drake retains the aggressive nature of its wyvernancestors, diving upon prey ina barely controlled descent,strafing its foes with its breathweapon and scattering them withits frightful presence, then pick-ing off lone survivors. When using the Flyby Attack feat, an abyssal drake can attackwith sting, bite, or both claws.Its claws lack the dexterity tosnatch up an opponent, so itcontents itself with merelyrending its foe. An abyssal drake’s natural weapons, as well as any weap-ons it wields, are treated aschaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for purpose of over-coming damage reduction. Breath W eapon (Su): 60- ft. cone, every 1d4 rounds,10d6 special, Reflex DC 20half. Much like a flame strike spell, half of this damage is fire damageand the remainder is unholydamage (and thus not subjectto resistance to fire and simi-lar defenses). The save DC isConstitution-based. Frightful Presence (Ex): When an abyssal drake charges, attacks, or flies over-head, it inspires terror in all creatures within120 feet that have fewer Hit Dice or levelsthan it has. Each potential victim must attempt a DC 17 Willsave. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomespanicked for 4d6 rounds, and one with 5 or more HDbecomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. A successful save leavesthat opponent immune to that abyssal drake’s frightfulpresence for 24 hours. Dragons ignore the frightful pres- ence of an abyssal drake, as do other abyssal drakes. Poison (Ex): Sting, Fortitude DC 20; initial and sec- ondary damage 2d6 Con. Rend (Ex): If an abyssal drake hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This rending attack automatically deals an extra 4d4+13 points of damage.",

PROTO-DRACOLICHES A proto-dracolich comes into being when a dracolich’s spirit possesses any body other than the corpse that was createdwhen the dragon consumed its dose of dracolich brew. Aproto-dracolich has the mind and memories of its originalform but the hit points and immunities of a dracolich. Aproto-dracolich can neither speak nor cast spells. Further, itcannot deal extra cold damage, use a breath weapon, or usefrightful presence as a dracolich. Its Strength, speed, andArmor Class are those of the possessed body . A proto-dracolich transforms into a full-fledged dracolich in 2d4 days. When the transformation is complete, the draco-lich’s form resembles that of its original body . It can nowspeak, cast spells, and employ the breath weapon it origi-nally had, in addition to gaining all the abilities of a draco-lich. A dracolich typically keeps a few “spare” bodies of asuitable size near the hiding place of its phylactery, so thatif its current form is destroyed, it can possess and transforma new body within a few days. DRACONIC CREATURE A draconic creature is descended from a dragon ancestor,though that ancestor may be many generations removed.Draconic creatures often bear hints of their heritage, such asslitted pupils or talonlike nails. They are sometimes mis-taken for half-dragons. It isn’t necessary to determine the source of a draconic creature’s heritage (unlike with half-dragons), since the crea-ture doesn’t gain any abilities directly related to its dragonancestor (such as resistance to a certain type of energy).SAMPLE DRACONIC CREATURE This example uses a fire giant as the base creature.

        "description":  "+2 Dragonkin are humanoid creatures believed to be distant cousins of dragons. Found in wild tribes or serving humanmasters, their brute strength and sharp claws make them adeadly threat. Dragonkin are humanoids of 8 to 9 feet in height with draconic features. Their scaled hides range from dark yellowocher to reddish brown with darker spots or bands. Theirfaces are decidedly dragonlike, with a long snout, a mane ofthick hair, and small horns swept back behind their heads.They have green wings that lighten to gold or yellow, orsometimes wings that match the color of their bodies. Dragonkin speak Draconic. COMBAT Dragonkin prefer to fight in the air, swooping down to slashearthbound opponents with their foreclaws. If forced to bringcombat to the ground, dragonkin move in and use their clawsor weapons (they favor longspears and other reach weapons). Most dragonkin have a strong desire to acquire magic items (perhaps inherited from their ancestors) and tend to attackcharacters possessing such items in preference to others. Ifpossible, a dragonkin grabs a magic item from its opponentand flees with it, taking the item back to its cave. (ResolveCHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSIllus. by S. T appinDraconic fire giantthis as a disarm attempt; since the dragonkin is unarmed, it holds the item if it wins the opposed check.) Rake (Ex): Dragonkin make two additional attacks (+10 melee) with their rear claws for 1d6+2 points of damageeach when attacking from the air. Detect Magic (Su): Dragonkin have the innate ability to use detect magic as a free action, once per round. DRAGONKIN AS CHARACTERS Most dragonkin with character classes are barbarians, and barbarian is their favored class. However, a handful of dragon-kin sorcerers have been reported, and their number seemsto be slowly increasing. DRAGONKIN PLAYER CHARACTERS Dragonkin characters possess the following racial traits.— +8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Wisdom, +2 Charisma. Dragonkin are powerful creatures that derivegreat abilities from their ancestral tie with the dragons. —Large size: –1 penalty to Armor Class, –1 penalty on at- tack r olls, –4 penalty on Hide checks, lifting and carrying limits twice those of Medium characters. —A dragonkin’s base land speed is 20 feet.

It is also among the most evil of the ele-mental drakes.Fire drakes range in color from blood red to a dazzling vermilion and are often mistaken for young red dragons,aided by the fact that the two creatures share similar terri-tories. They enjoy capitalizing on this mistaken identity, bargaining that most people would do anything to avoid angering a red dragon. The eyes of a fire drake are fiery yellow. Most fire drakes avoid direct contact with red dragons. Fire giants occasionally tame these drakes as pets or guardians, though the drakes have no love for the giants. Fire drakes speak both Draconic and Ignan in a screeching tone. Combat A fire drake often feigns surprise when encountered, attempt- ing to draw oppo- nents into range of its attacks of oppor- tunity . Thanks to its Combat Reflexes feat, it may make four such attacks each round. Heat (Ex): A fire drake’s red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage when- ever it hits in melee or, when grappling, dur- ing each round that it maintains a hold.

Their bodies are armored with bony plates that rise into projecting spurs at limb joints and end in long, forked tails tipped with a pair of scythelike bone blades. They fly poorly, but can rise with a single clap of their wings to lunge forward. Their body plates are a mottled gray and brown, their wings are small but muscled, and their eyes tend to be glittering red or orange. Fang dragons’ heads are adorned with many small horns or spikes. Fang dragons prefer to seek food far from their lairs, typically walling up their residences with huge boulders to keep out intruders in their absence. They speak snip- pets of many languages and bargain to avoid hopeless or hard battles. They are prone to random violence and outbursts of rage. Fang dragons eat all manner of fresh meat. They especially enjoy the flesh of intelligent mammals. Combat Fang dragons are masters of physical combat, and every partof their body is lethal. They have a tendency to play withtheir food in a cruel way . Young adult and older fang dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcomingdamage reduction.

GHOSTLY DRAGON A ghost template is found in the Monster Manual. The ghostly dragon template presented here provides an alternativemethod of creating ghostly dragons to have them retainmore of their innate draconic power and deadliness. Ghostly dragons are most often created when a power- ful dragon is slain and its hoard looted. In such a case, theghostly dragon can only be laid to rest by returning its losttreasure (or the equivalent value) to the creature’s lair.(You can estimate the ghostly dragon’s hoard by using theaverage treasure value for an encounter with the dragon,were it still alive.) Should this occur, the ghostly dragonsettles upon the new hoard and disappears into nothing-ness, taking the hoard with it to the afterlife.SAMPLE GHOSTLY DRAGON This example uses an adult green dragon as the base dragon.

It measures up to 15 feet inlength and typically stands 7 to 8 feet high at the shoulder.Smoke trails from its nostrils except when the creature is atrest, and when animate, it exudes a palpable heat. Combat The ironwyrm golem softens up foes with its fiery breathand then uses its formidable strength to destroy its foes inmelee. It can even use this breath weapon on itself, in orderto restore hit points or negate slow effects. Breath W eapon (Su): 60-ft. cone, every 1d4 rounds, 20d10 fire, Reflex DC 30 half. The breath weapon type remains the same regardless of the dragon spirit con tained within. Immunity to Magic (Ex): An ironwyrm golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects,except as follows. A cold effect slows it (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow 165CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS Illus. by M.

For example, anironwyrm golem hit by a delayed blast fireball cast by a 15th-level wizard that would normally deal 52points of damage instead gainsback 17 hit points. The golemgets no saving throw againstfire effects. Immunity to Rust (Ex): An ironwyrm golem is im-mune to rust attacks, whethermagical or not. Construction An ironwyrm golem is sculptedfrom 5,000 pounds of pureiron, smelted with other rarecomponents and elixirs cost-ing at least 25,000 gp. As-sembling the body requiresa DC 30 Craft (armor-smithing or weapon-smithing) check.

HALF-DRAGON The half-dragon template on page 146 of the Monster Manual presents special attacks and special qualities for half-dragonversions of the ten varieties of true dragons described in thatbook. The information here expands that list to include alltrue dragons published in D UNGEONS \u0026 D RAGONS products to date. The Half-Dragon Breath Weapons table below presents the breath weapon type for each half-dragon derived fromone of the various true dragons that have appeared inMonsters of Faerûn, Monster Manual II, Fiend Folio, and this book .A half-dragon’s line-shaped breath weapon is always 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 60 feet long. A half-dragon’scone-shaped breath weapon is always 30 feet long, 30 feethigh, and 30 feet wide. The Half-Dragon Immunities and Resistances table below presents the immunities and/or resistances possessed byhalf-dragons descended from these true dragons. The lung dragons, presen ted in Oriental Adventures , are a special case. Many either don’t have breath weapons or lackimmunities (or both), so half-dragons descended from theseparents gain special attacks and special qualities as noted onthe Lung Half-Dragons table below.Cause Rain (Su): A half-chiang lung can breathe storm clouds three times per day, causing rain. The rain lasts for 2d4 hours and extends in a 2-mile radius centered on the half-dragon. Roar (Ex): A half-li lung can roar three times per day, creating a sound resembling metal scraping against stone. All creatures within 60 feet are automati- cally deafened for 1 round (no saving throw). Water Fire (Su): Three times per day, a half-pan lung or half-shen lung touching or submerged in water can sur- round itself in an aura of ghostly, flickering, multi- colored flames that cause damage to any creature touching it. Any creature striking the half-dragon with a natural weapon or a melee weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Lung dragons and half-lung dragons are immune to water fire. The water fire lasts for 1 minute or until it comes in contact with normal or magical fire.

HOARD SCARAB A hoard scarab is an eyeless, beetlelike creature that hides in piles of treasure. Thanks to its size and its silver or goldenshell, it looks much like a coin when dormant (though closeobservation reveals its nature). A swarm resembles a pile ofgold and silver pieces. Hoard scarabs are often found hidden among the treasure of a dragon (hencetheir name). They often live in a symbi-otic relationship with a dragon,keeping the wyrm’s scales cleanof troublesome vermin (the drag-on’s natural armor keeps it safefrom the scarab’s burrow ability). Hoard scarabs are unintelli- gent and cannot speak or under- stand any languages.COMBAT An individual hoard scarab seeks to burrow into its target’sflesh. However, hoard scarabs prefer to attack en masse,swarming over a target and chewing it apart. Burrow (Ex): If a hoard scarab hits a Small or larger living creature with a bite attack (or if a hoard scarabswarm hits with its swarm attack), on its next turn it canattempt to burrow into the target’s flesh. The target mayattempt a Reflex save (DC 11 for an individual scarab, orDC 14 for a swarm) to prevent the hoard scarab from bur-rowing in (a helpless creature can’t prevent the burrow-ing). If the save fails, each round thereafter the target takes1d2 points of Constitution damage (from an individualscarab) or 2d4 points of Constitution damage (from aswarm of scarabs). A hoard scarab doesn’t leave a target until the target is dead. Once a hoard scarab has burrowed into its target, it canbe destroyed by any effect that would cure a disease, suchasremove disease orheal. (A single spell eliminates all bur- rowing hoard scarabs, though it gives no protection againstfurther burrowings.) Creatures with immunity to disease, as well as those with a natural armor bonus (including enhancement) of+3 or better, are immune to a hoard scarab’s burrowingattack. Distraction (Ex): Any living cr eature vulnerable to the swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in itssquare is nauseated for 1 round (For titude DC 14 negates). Even with a s uccessful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentra-tion check (DC 20 + spell level). Using any skill involvingpatience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentrationcheck. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot betripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapplean opponent. A hoard scarab swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate ). A swarm takes a –10 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affectan area, such as many evocation spells or splash weapons. Ifsuch as attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarmtakes double damage instead. Hoard scarab swarms are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For purposes of deter- mining the effects of wind on a hoard scarab swarm, treatthe swarm as a creature of Fine size. Wind effects deal 1d6points of nonlethal damage to the swarm per spell level (orHit Die of the originating creature, in the case of effectssuch as an air elemental’s whirlwind). A swarm renderedunconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disor-ganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hitpoints exceed its nonlethal damage. For full information about the swarm subtype, see pages 315 and 316 of the Monster Manual.",

        "description":  "+2 The Underdark landwyrm, or cave dragon, spends its entire existence in darkness, making evil plans and sowing death. The creature’s hide is dark gray, to match its subterranean environment. Its vision and hearing are extraordinarilypoor, though it makes up for this disadvantage with othersensory capabilities. Underdark landwyrms often keep elaborate lairs that take advantage of their natural surroundings, such as chasms orlakes. They can sometimes be swayed by gifts of magic. Underdark landwyrms speak Draconic, Undercommon, and Common. Combat An Underdark landwyrm relies on its blindsense to sensenearby prey . Once it detects a victim, it uses obscuring mist to cloak its quiet approach, and then bursts into view withfrightful presence. It often retreats from battle after injuringopponents, relying on the wounds inflicted upon its preyto further weaken them. Blindsense (Ex): An Underdark landwyrm’s extraordinary powers of scent and echolocation allow it to pinpoint thelocation of any living creature within 60 feet. Frightful Presence (Ex): 60-ft. radius, HD 11 or fewer, Will DC 19 negates. 175CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS176Obscuring Mist (Su): Three times per day, an Underdark landwyrm can exhale a cloud of obscuring mist (as the spell,caster level equals landwyrm’s HD). W ounding (Ex): An Underdark landwyrm’s claws deal bleeding wounds, similar to those caused by a woundingweapon. In addition to hit point damage, a claw attack deals1 point of Constitution damage when it hits a creature. Acritical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage.Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this Con-stitution damage.",

        "description":  "Wyrmling +2; very young +3; young +4; juvenile +4; others — Battle dragons are glorious creature that exult in valorous combat. They often serve as steeds for powerful warriors. A battle dragon at rest has a dull brown sheen to its scales. However, as soon as it takes wing, allowing the sun to strikeits armored skin, it gleams like the finest gold. Battle dragons are notorious optimists, and always seem to find the silver lining to any cloud. This emotion isoften contagious, as they inspire others to bravery andvalor in battle. By juvenile age, battle dragons may find use as steeds for Small riders. Young adult and older dragons can serveMedium riders. Some cities or knightly orders have reachedmutual protection and assistance accords with nearby battledragon families, as generation after generation of riderfinds an ally within the same line of dragons. Battle dragons speak Common, Draconic, and Celestial.CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS Battle dragonCombat A battle dragon is a fearless combatant, raised from birth totake joy in the simple act of conflict. It uses its special abilitiesto fortify the prowess of its allies, while striking fear into foeswith its breath weapon, frightful presence, and battle fury . Young and older battle dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcomingdamage reduction. Battle Fury (Ex): Once per day, an ancient or older battle dragon may enter a battle fury, which grants it a +2 moralebonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonuson Will saves, but a –2 penalty to AC. This battle fury lastsfor a number of rounds equal to the dragon’s (new) Consti-tution modifier +3, at the end of which the dragon loses theindicated bonuses but suffers no fatigue or other ill effects.This ability is otherwise identical to the barbarian’s rageclass feature. Breath W eapon (Su): A battle dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of sonic energy and a cone of fear gas.Creatures within the cone of fear gas must succeed on a Willsave or become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Multiple exposuresare not cumulative, but if an affected creature is alreadyshaken (for instance, from the dragon’s frightful presence),it becomes frightened instead. Inspire Courage (Su): Once per day, an adult or older battle dragon can inspire courage in itself and its allies,granting them a +2 morale bonus on saving throws againstcharm or fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rollsand weapon damage rolls. This is identical with the bardicability of the same name, and requires the dragon to speak, sing, or roar for 1 full round.

A chaos dragon speaks Draconic and either Celestial (chaotic good and some chaotic neutral dragons only) or Abyssal (chaotic evil and some chaotic neutral dragons only).

Ethereal dragons are naturally curious and inquisitive, and often spy on those “stuck” on the Material Plane. They are alsogreedy, and may come to covet the valuables carried by thosethey spy upon. In such cases, an ethereal dragon might visitthe Material Plane only to appropriate such items, returningto its native Ethereal Plane as soon as possible. Ethereal dragons speak Draconic.

A howling dragon is long and slender, with short, thinlegs and narrow wings. Longspines form a frill behind itshead, and twin clusters of simi-lar spines sprout from its shoul-ders. Its scales are mottledpurple and black, darkening asthe dragon ages. Its yellow eyesare large and feral-looking, withtiny pupils. Howling dragons make their lairs in isolated caverns amid thetwisting tunnels of their nativeplane. When they find their wayto the Material Plane, they seekout similar terrain, and are thususually encountered far under-ground. They roam widely in theterritory surrounding their lair,exploring every narrow creviceand tunnel. Howling dragons feed on any creatures they can catch—living, undead, or even construct.They enjoy the sensation of bitinginto a still-moving morsel. Combat Howling dragons attack with primal feroc-ity, battering their foes with every power at their disposal.They breathe as often as possible, switching between breathforms apparently at random. Young and older howling dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcomingdamage reduction. Breath W eapon (Su): A howling dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of howling sound that deals sonicdamage, or a cone of maddening wails. Creatures withinthe area of the maddening wails effect must succeed on aFortitude save or take 1 point of Wisdom damage per age category of the dragon. On the plane of Pan- demonium, where screaming winds restrict sound and hearing, both effects are limited to a 10- foot cone. Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day— Tasha’s hideous laughter, wind wall; 1/day— confusion, gust of wind, insanity, phantasmal killer, shatter, shout, sound burst, symbol of insan- ity, weird, whirlwind.

Oceanus dragons speak Celestial, Draconic, and Aquan. Combat Oceanus dragons prefer to endfights quickly, using their tranquil-ity breath weapon and spell-likeabilities to neutralize foes.

They are native to the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, an infinite plane ofvolcanic earthbergs and infernal lava. A pyroclastic dragon is solidly built and powerfully mus- cled, conveying a sense of immovability . Its scales resemblefractured obsidian and glowing magma, forming a mottledpattern of reds, oranges, blacks, and grays over its entirebody . Its large wings seem almost to be made of ash, butdespite their flimsy appearance they are quite capable ofbearing the dragon’s great weight aloft. Pyroclastic dragons enjoy swimming through magma, but they make their lairs in caves carved out of volcanic rock.When they venture to the Material Plane, they live only involcanic regions. These dragons enjoy the taste of meat but can also subsist on a purely mineral diet.Combat Pyroclastic dragons have all the subtlety of a volcaniceruption—they may simmer and hiss for a time, but whenthey erupt at last their fury is unmatched. Young and older pyroclastic dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcomingdamage reduction.

If you can bear to look upon its grandeur, you can make out that its perfectly shaped scales glisten like molten white gold. Its proud, regal bearing is unmistak- able, and its voice rings like heavenly thunder. Radiant dragons prefer lairs that allow plenty of sunlight, and often place gems and other bright valuables in places where they catch and refract the light, creat- ing marvelous displays of color and radiance. To creatures that display nobility and justice, they are the staunchest of allies, offer- ing succor and healing to any in need. But when faced by those who foster chaos or evil, a radiant dragon becomes a furious whirl of color and light, destroying all who oppose it. Radiant dragons speak Common, Celes- tial, and Draconic.

        "description":  "Wyrmling +4; very young +4; young +5; others — Native to the Infernal Battlefield of Acheron, rust dragons are creatures of tarnished metal, embodying forces of decay andcorruption. Some Material Plane sages posit some connec-tion between these fiendish monstrosities and the relativelyinnocuous rust monster, but the rational mind correctly seesthese claims as the ravings of deranged lunatics. Rust dragons bear a str ong resemblance to the metallic dragons of theMaterial Plane, but appearcovered in rust, tarnish,or verdigris. Thoughsome rust drag-ons resemblecopper drag-ons and otherssilver or brass,individualrust dragons’abilities donot differ. Theirscales appear pit-ted and lined withcorrosive color, andthe membranes of their wingsare very thin and iridescent. On their native plane of Acheron, rust dragonshave an ample food supplyin the endless iron cubesthe size of continents floating in the void. When drawn tothe Material Plane, rust dragons seek out veins of metal inunderground caverns, making them particularly loathedby miners. Rust dragons feed on corroded metal, but enjoy fresh meat (particularly vermin) to cleanse the palate between ores. Combat Rust dragons are not the furious forces of nature that pyro-clastic dragons are, nor are they violently insane like howl-ing dragons. Rather, they are simply hungry, and they attackcarefully with their goal clearly fixed in mind. They do nottolerate too much interference in pursuit of that goal, andreadily break off from combat if a meal proves to be moretrouble than it’s worth. Young and older rust dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damagereduction. Breath W eapon (Su): A rust dragon has two breath weapons: a line of acid or a cone of reddish-brown liquidthat instantly corrodes and destroys any metal it touches.Attended and magical metals receive Reflex saves to avoidthis effect, but any metal is susceptible: iron, steel, silver, gold, even mithral and adamantine. Metal Resistance (Ex): A rust dragon is resistant to attacks from metal weapons. Against weapons whosedamage-dealing part is metal (a blade, metal point, arrow-head, or even mace head), a rust dragon has damage reduc-tion equal to what a rust dragon two age categories olderthan itself has. Wyrm and great wyrm rust dragons havedamage reduction 20/magic and 10/chaotic against metalweapons, and lesser weapons corrode when used againstthem (see Rusting Scales, below). Rusting Bite (Ex): A rust dragon that makes a successful bite attack causes metal armor worn by the target creature tocorrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless immediately . A dragon can also use its bite attack to target a weapon or other metal object, of course. The size of the ob- ject is immaterial— a full suit of armor rusts away as quickly as a sword. Magic metal items are allowed Reflex saves against a DC equal to the dragon’s breath weapon save DC. Rusting Scales (Ex): A metal weap- on with less than a +5 enhancement bonus that hits a wyrm or great wyrm rust dragon corrodes and is de- stroyed immediately, with no saving throw. A +5 weapon deals damage nor- mally, but then must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal tothe dragon’s breath weapon save DC) or rust away . Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day— wall of iron; 1/day— acid fog, repel metal or stone. STYX DRAGON Dragon (Aquatic, Extraplanar)Environment: Any Lower Plane",

One of the few creatures immune tothe harmful effects of the river, Styx dragons swim withimpunity across the top layers of all the Lower Planes, feast-ing on fiends and any other creature they can find and catch. A Styx dragon has a long, serpentine body with tiny, flip- perlike claws that are useless on land and in combat. Itswings are too small to carry it aloft, but helpto propel it through the water. Its tailsplits into two long, bladed whipsthat it can use to slash andgrab its prey . A Styx drag-on’s scales are slimyand range from darkbrown to rusty redin color. Its eyesglow with a luridyellow light. Styx dragons make their lairsby burrowinginto the mud onthe banks of theStyx. They do notlike to leave theirnative plane, but ifone is forcibly broughtto the Material Plane, itwill thrive in fetid water. Styx dragons normally subsist on the flesh of fiends, but enjoy eating any meat—particularly rotting carrion. Combat A Styx dragon’s physical attacks are limited: It attacks withthe twin blades of its tail instead of claws, it cannot use itswings effectively, and it does not gain tail slap attacks inaddition to its tail blades. Its tail blades deal damage as ifthe dragon were one size category larger than actual, how- ever, as does its tail sweep. Young and older Styx dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcomingdamage reduction. Breath W eapon (Su): A Styx dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid that persists for 3 rounds (deal-ing half damage on the second round and one-quarterdamage on the third round), or a cone of stupefying gas.Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude saveor take 1 point of Intelligence damage per age category of the dragon. Amphibious (Ex): Although Styx dragons are aquatic, they can survive indefi- nitely on land. Constrict (Ex): With a suc- cessful grapple check, a Styx dragon can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing twice its tail blade dam- age as bludgeon- ing damage. Disease (Ex): Any crea- ture hit by a Styx dragon’s bite or tail attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon save DC) or contract Sty- gian wasting. The symptoms of the dis- ease include flesh rotting away and hair falling out. The incubation period is 1 day, and the disease deals 1d6points of Charisma damage. A victim must make three suc-cessful Fortitude saves in a row to recover from Stygian wast-ing (see Disease, page 292 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a Styx dragon must hit a creature that is at least one size categoryCHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSStyx Dragons by Age Breath Frightful Base Attack/ Fort Ref Will Weapon Presence Age Size Hit Dice (hp) Str Dex Con Int Wis Cha Grapple Attack Save Save Save (DC) DCWyrmling S 5d12+5 (37) 13 10 13 10 11 10 +5/+2 +7 +5 +4 +4 1d6 (13) — Very young M 8 d12+16 (68) 15 10 15 12 13 12 +8/+10 +10 +8 +6 +7 2d6 (16) 15Young M 11 d12+22 (93) 17 10 15 12 13 12 +11/+14 +14 +9 +7 +8 3d6 (17) 16 Juvenile L 14 d12+42 (133) 19 10 17 14 15 14 +14/+22 +17 +12 +9 +11 4d6 (20) 19Young adult L 17 d12+68 (178) 23 10 19 14 15 14 +17/+27 +22 +14 +10 +12 5d6 (22) 20 Adult H 20 d12+100 (230) 27 10 21 16 17 16 +20/+36 +26 +17 +12 +15 6d6 (25) 23Mature adult H 23 d12+115 (264) 29 10 21 18 19 18 +23/+40 +30 +18 +13 +17 7d6 (26) 25 Old H 26 d12+156 (325) 31 10 23 20 21 20 +26/+44 +34 +21 +15 +20 8d6 (29) 28Very old H 29 d12+174 (362) 33 10 23 22 23 22 +29/+48 +38 +22 +16 +22 9d6 (30) 30 Ancient G 32 d12+224 (432) 35 10 25 24 25 24 +32/+56 +40 +25 +18 +25 10d6 (33) 33Wyrm G 35 d12+280 (507) 37 10 27 24 25 24 +35/+60 +44 +27 +19 +26 11d6 (35) 34 Great wyrm G 38 d12+304 (551) 39 10 27 26 27 26 +38/+64 +48 +29 +21 +29 12d6 (37) 37 Styx dragonsmaller than itself with its tail blade attack.

Tarterian dragons are skeletally gaunt, withleathery scales stretchedtight over withered-looking flesh. Theirwings have a tatteredappearance, though theycan fly fast and ably .Their teeth and claws arelong and black, while their scales form a striped pattern ofblack, gray, and olive green. Ghostly green light flickers intheir black eyes, and their faces seem to wear a perpetualsneering grin. Tarterian dragons inhabit a wide range of habitats on their native plane of Carceri, from the steaming junglesof Cathrys (the second layer) to the cruel mountains ofColothys (the fourth). Similarly, when they make their wayto the Material Plane they can dwell comfortably in a varietyof locales, both above and under the ground. They delight inreproducing the jailhouse atmosphere of Carceri wheneverthey find themselves on the Material Plane. Tarterian dragons are accustomed to a diet of fiendish flesh and condemned souls. They do not enjoy other food,but can live on literally anything.Combat Tarterian dragons use their spell-like abilities to divide and constrain their opponents, trying to face each one individually when possible. They use their gas breath weaponto weaken foes at thestart of combat, thentheir force breath to takeout the strongest foes. Young and older Tarter- ian dragons’ natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcom- ing damage reduction. Breath W eapon (Su): A Tarterian dragon has two types of breathweapon, a line of disrup-tive force or a cone ofwill-sapping gas. Crea-tures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or be affected by a crushing despair effect, taking a –2 penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rollsfor 1 round per age category of the dragon. Force Resistance (Ex): Tarterian dragons have a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against force-based spells and effects. Freedom of Movement (Su): Tarterian dragons can move and attack normally despite any magic that usuallyimpedes movement, such as hold monster, paralysis effects, solid fog, slow, and web spells. Strength of Will (Ex): Tarterian dragons have a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compul-sion effects.

A successful Reflex save (againstthe same DC) reduces the number of negative levels byhalf (round down). Shadow Blend (Su): In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a very young or older shadow dragoncan disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment.Artificial illumination, even a light orcontinual flame spell, does not negate this ability . A daylight spell, however, does. Create Shadows (Su): Three times per day, a great wyrm shadow dragon can conjure a mass of leaping shadows with a radius of 100 yards and a duration of 1 hour (this is a creation effect). All normal and magical light sources are negated within this radius. All characters and creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Hide checks within the shadows, and can hide even if directly ob- served. Shadow drag- ons and other creatures with ties to the Plane of Shadow gain total concealment with- in the shadows, though they can move and at- tack normally .

Despite a skeletal dragon’s loss of sentience, thepinpoints of red light smoldering in its eye sockets betraythe spark of unlife that still exists. Like typical skeletons, skeletal dragons do only what they are ordered to do. They can draw no conclusions of theirown and take no initiative. Necromancers particularly prizeskeletal dragons, because they make formidable guardians.They are sturdier than a typical skeleton of their size, andtheir added qual-ities striketerror intowould-be intruders.

Sages guess that it hassome connection to the gibbering mouther, but it is morehideous and deadly than that creature. A typical squamous spewer—if such a thing can be said to exist—has scales of many different colors and lusters,sometimes both chromatic and metallic in nature. It has no 193CHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERS194allegiance to dragons, and in fact, the two species gener- ally despise one another. Squamous spewers speak D raconic. COMBAT A squamous spewer prefers to hide from enemies until they are within range of its roar. After dispersing weaker foes, the creature uses its breath weapons until targets close within melee range (using Combat Reflexes if the opportunity pres- ents itself ). Breath W eapon (Su): Despite its large number of mouths, a squamous spewer can only use one type of breath weaponin a given round, though it may spew it from up to threemouths simultaneously in up to three different areas. Theenergy type is determined randomly by rolling d% beforeeach use: 01–25 acid, 26–50 cold, 51–75 electricity, 76–100fire. The area of the breath weapon in any given round iseither a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line (50% chance ofeither). Regardless of the type of energy it uses or the areait affects, the breath weapon deals 3d6 points of damage(Reflex DC 17 half ). Once a squamous spewer uses itsbreath weapon, it cannot use it again until 1d4 roundshave passed. Some squamous spewers may have breath weapon vari- eties that differ from these options—the DM can select abreath weapon possessed by anothertype of dragon if he or she so wishes. Roar (Ex): Three times per day, a squamous spewer can let loose afrightening roar from its manymouths. All creatures withina 60-foot-radius spread withfewer Hit Dice than the squa-mous spewer become panickedif they fail a DC 19 Fortitudesave. Creatures withHD equal to or greaterthan the squamousspewer are shaken ona failed save ratherthan panicked. Amorphous (Ex): Squamous spewers arenot subject to criticalhits. They have noclear front or back,so they cannot beflanked. Blindsense (Ex): A squamous spewer’s extraordinary powers of scent and echolocation allow it to pinpoint thelocation of any living creature within 60 feet.",

When the creature is at rest, a storm drake’s scales have a pearl- escent sheen. A happy cloud dragon shimmers with golden highlights, while an angered one turns dark gray, like a thundercloud. The drake’s silver wings are nearly translucent. A storm drake spends most of its life soaring through the clouds, enjoying weather in all its variable forms. It typicallymakes its lair on a misty mountain peak. Storm drakes speak Draconic and Auran. Some also learn Common or Giant to converse with creatures living neartheir lair. COMBAT A storm drake picks its fights carefully . Assuming it isconfident of victory, it begins by using its breath weaponCHAPTER 4: NEW MONSTERSIllus. by S. T appin Squamous spewerto separate the combatants from one another, then softens up the remaining opponents with call lightning ,ice storm , and shout . If it has time to prepare, it may use control winds orcontrol weather to create a setting more conducive to itsvictory . It doesn’t hesi-tate to flee if out-matched, using eithergaseous form or (ifpursued) wind walk to escape. Breath W eapon (Su): A storm drake has one type of breathweapon, a 60-foot coneof wind usable once every1d4 rounds. This attack pro-duces the equivalent of tor-nado-strength winds (seeTable 3–24 on page 95 ofthe Dungeon Master’s Guide ). Those in the cone may attempt DC30 Fortitude saves toresist the effect. Gaseous Form (Su): A storm drake can assume gaseous form atwill as a standard action. While gaseous, the drake has a flyspeed of 60 feet (perfect) and is unaffected by wind of anykind. It can’t attack or use its breath weapon while gaseous,but it can use spell-like abilities normally . This ability is oth-erwise identical with the gaseous form spell. Snatch (Ex): Against Medium or smaller creatures, bite for 4d6+12/round or claw for 2d8+6/round. Spell-Like Abilities: At will— fog cloud (DC 17), 3/day— call lightning (DC 18) , sleet storm (DC 18) , stinking cloud (DC 18), wind wall (DC 18); 1/day— control weather (DC 21) , con- trol winds (DC 20) , ice storm (DC 19), shout (DC 19) , wind walk (DC 22). Caster level 20th. VAMPIRIC DRAGON A vampiric dragon is forever anchored to its hoard, muchlike a normal vampire craves its coffin. It appears much as itdid as a living dragon, though its eyes gleam with a feral andpredatory glint. It dreams only of death and evil, spreadinglegends of its treasure to draw in unwitting adventurers inorder to create vampire spawn. Thankfully, such creatures are rare in the extreme, most often created by energy draining effects or unique conflu-ences of negative energy . Like normal vampires, vampiric dragons cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any lan-guages they knew in life.

With their high degree of intelli- gence, most dragons have an affinity for language and speakadditional languages as well. Many even study the science oflanguage, developing a wide range of tongues. As with all intelligent creatures, a dragon speaks a number of additional languages equal to its Intelligence bonus. Dragons with ranks in the Speak Language skill can speak a number of additional languages equal to those ranks. Additional languages commonly spoken by dragons include Auran, Celestial, Common, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Ignan, Infernal, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon. pqqqqrspqqqqrs202Breath W eapon (Su): 30-ft. line, 2d4 acid, Reflex DC 13 half. Kurnoc Very Young Black Dragon Kurnoc likes to prowl around his home swamp and con-gratulate himself on how nasty and tough and excellent heis. Kurnoc takes special delight in stealing kills from otherpredators. (Such victories seem more like conquests thansimply collecting food.) Kurnoc likes to announce his presence before attacking, usually by bellowing a challenge. His favorite topic of con-versation is the party’s ultimate demise at the fangs andclaws of Kurnoc. If a party decides to retreat in response toKurnoc’s bluster, the dragon attacks the moment their backsare turned. When facing one opponent in battle, Kurnoc usually charges, snarling and spitting like an angry cat. This dis-play often sends the foe running, and the dragon gleefullypursues. When facing a group of intelligent foes, Kurnoctaunts and threatens for a short while, then attacks byusing his breath weapon on as many enemies as possiblebefore charging into melee.",

Her blood boils when-ever she sees a humanoid traveling with a domestic animal,because she believes that no humanoid should have masteryof anything else, except perhaps, another humanoid. Shenever hesitates to attack caravans, even when they are fartoo large for her to handle.
