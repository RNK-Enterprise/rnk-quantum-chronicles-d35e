Sheeredni-vaktar Wyrm Gold Dragon As if the abundance of evil in the world weren’t bad enough,Sheeredni-vaktar is fond of saying, just look at the way sup-posedly good people behave. She has no tolerance whatso-ever for poor manners, bad grooming, offensive language,or—worst of all—anything she defines as immorality . Herdefinition goes far beyond any objective definitions of evil,including such sins as impiety and irreverence, disrespectfor one’s elders, the use of alcohol and other drugs, andsexual promiscuity . Perhaps surprisingly, she does not takeissue with the prevalence of violence, and, in fact, quicklyresorts to violent measures to discipline those who offendher sense of propriety—even if that violence is just a back-handed swat with her tail for nonlethal damage, accompa-nied by a sharp-tongued admonition.

Thedragon has amassed a collection of books from lands knownand unknown, purchasing, trading for, and even copyinghimself every book he can find. He does not bother with thetraditional wealth of a dragon’s hoard—“You can’t learn any-thing from gold,” he often says with a snort—valuing cur-rency only insofar as it can be used to acquire more books.His breadth of knowledge is astonishing, accumulated overa period of four millennia. As his twilight approaches,Riikano-alinaris is searching for an appropriate heir to hiscollection. He has many children, but none of them haveproven to his satisfaction that their love of knowledge, andof books in particular, is great enough to deserve such amonumental inheritance.

Giixhosiptor Very Old Green Dragon Giixhosiptor loves to play . He spends much of his time inhis lair, concocting different games. He ventures out whenbored and seeks weak or gullible creatures with whom toplay some of his strange games. One of his favorite activi-ties is to lure less powerful creatures, especially adventur-ers, to his lair. He then tries to trap them, without killingthem. After making them give up a large percentage oftheir magical equipment, he offers it back if they performsome small service for him. Then, he sends them out to runan arbitrary errand, such as killing a chimera, tanning itshide, and bringing him the skin for a rug. When the adven-turers return, he is dissatisfied with the result, stating thathe had wanted a larger or smaller rug or one that was a dif-ferent color. He gives the adventurers back the rug andperhaps a single item from their equipment, and thensends them off again on a different, difficult, but equallymeaningless task. After two or three such exchanges, eitherthe creatures refuse to continue or Giixhosiptor has grownbored and he decides to eat the creatures with whom hehas been playing.",

Thedragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until itchooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form. Cloudwalking (Su): All silver dragons can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground. This ability functionscontinuously but can be negated or resumed at will as a free action. Nimbus Wyrmling Silver Dragon Nimbus has an insatiable appetite for doing good deeds andfor learning other people’s business. He finds the varioustasks and errands that humans tackle every day to be endlessfascinating, though he doesn’t quite understand why they’reso busy all the time. He often trudges about posing as a human woodcutter, a gnome peddler, or a big, shaggy dog. He gladly renders assis-tance to anyone who needs it, and he tries anything thoughhe’s not always up to the task. He once offered to chop woodfor an old widow and nearly chopped off a foot with the axe.",

Namhias Young Silver Dragon When older silver dragons try to impress upon youngstersof their race the importance of subtlety, level-headedness,and patience, they seldom fail as spectacularly as they didwith Namhias. Some say this young dragon forced his wayout of his shell weeks before his hatchmates. Whether thatis true or not, Namhias has been in a hurry ever since. Easilyangered by injustice or bullying, the young silver dragonrushes into combat at any real provocation. While he doestry not to kill those he can subdue, sometimes he forgets thestrength of whatever form he is currently in.

        "description":  "The DM rolls 2d6 ×1,000 to determine the number of gold pieces in a hoard and gets a result of 7,000.He first reduces this to 6,000, then rolls 1d10 for the hun- dreds, tens, and ones digits, getting results of 4, 5, and 1. Thiscomes out to 6,451 gp—a nice, nonround number. In the long run, this method slightly reduces the amount of coinage found by the PCs. If you’re worriedabout this small shrinkage, you can easily add in an itemof equivalent value elsewhere in the hoard. For instance,using the example above, you could drop in another itemelsewhere in the hoard worth 500 to 600 gp to make up the difference. Another option is to replace the coinage with anotherform of currency . Particularly for large transactions, coinsaren’t a very efficient mode ofcurrency—paper money iseasier to transport, and bars oringots are easier to count. In most medieval fantasy cultures, paper money is ararity . However, IOUs, letters of credit, or similar “prom-ises of payment” could easilyexist, particularly in a mer-cantile culture. Such anitem is literally worth far more than its weight in gold, but can probably only be exchanged in communities of reasonable size. As a rule of thumb, no IOU worth more than a town’s gold piece limit can be exchanged in a community . What’s more, unless you’re trading it to the person who signed it in the first place, you may only be able get one-half its value in coins or goods (this is up to the DM and the sit- uation). Player characters desperate to get full value might end up traveling from city to city in search of the merchant whose name is on the certificate. Of course, there’s no guarantee thatthe item is genuine (see the Forgery skill, page 74 of thePlayer’s Handbook ), though you should use this sort of plot device sparingly . Bars or ingots of metal are particularly common in soci- eties that deal readily in such goods, such as those ofdwarves and gnomes. They typically bear an identifyingstamp. A typical trade bar of precious metal weighs 1pound and is worth 50 coins of the same metal. Trade Bar Value GP Value Copper 50 cp 0.5 gp Silver 50 sp 5 gpGold 50 gp 50 gp Platinum 50 pp 500 gp 277APPENDIX278As the Player’s Handbook points out (see Wealth Other than Coins, page 112 of the Player’s Handbook ), most wealth isn’t in the form of coins or currency of any kind. It’s easy toimagine that a dragon who periodically raids merchantcaravans might have a hoard that includes a variety oftrade goods. Since trade goods can generally be exchangedfor full value, you can replace a quantity of coins in thehoard for an equivalent value of one or more trade goods.Of course, a shortage or surplus of certain trade goods ina particular area can adjust these prices dramatically, atyour option. To generate these items randomly, use TableA–1: Trade Goods. Roll percentile dice to determine thecategory of the item (“Food, drink, and spices” is one cate-gory, for example), then roll again for the specific itemwithin that category (such as “Ale, common”).The pricesgiven are per pound or pint (except for cloth, which is persquare yard). If you’re not interested in variety in your currency, you can even inject a spark of interest into a pile of ordinary coins.Since every coin typically bears the mark of the kingdom,province, or city-state that minted it, simply putting a for-eign or otherwise unusual mint-mark on your coins canresult in the characters asking interesting questions abouthow the coins got there. If a dragon’s hoard contains plat-inum coins bearing the imprint of a elf-headed spider, thecharacters may (correctly or incorrectly) suspect an alliancebetween the dragon and the drow. GOODS Of the three categories of treasure in a hoard, this one holdsthe best opportunities for making your dragon’s hoard aninteresting one. After all, there are dozens of varieties ofgems and virtually unlimited variations on art objects. Insome cases, you may create art objects so interesting thatthe characters prefer to keep them rather than selling them! Goods, particularly art objects, provide you with a great opportunity for adventure hooks. Perhaps the characterswant to find the creator of a particular sculpture or paint-ing, or the original occupant of an ancient ornate throne.APPENDIX pqqqqrsTable A–1: Trade Goods d% Goods 01–40 Food, drink, and spices 01–08 Ale, common (3 cp) 09–11 Ale, fine (2 gp) 12–17 Cinnamon (1 gp) 18 Cloves (15 gp) 19–23 Cooking oil, common (1 cp) 24–26 Cooking oil, rare (1 gp) 27–38 Flour (2 cp)39–43 Ginger (2 gp) 44–48 Pepper (2 gp) 49 Saffron (15 gp) 50–52 Salt (5 gp)53–62 Tea leaves (2 sp) 63–72 Tobacco (5 sp)73–84 Wheat (1 cp) 85–92 Wine, common (3 cp)93–95 Wine, fine (5 gp) 96–100 Other 41–70 Ore or lumber 01–02 Adamantine (100 gp) 03–22 Copper (5 sp) 23–27 Darkwood (10 gp)28–37 Gold (50 gp) 38–62 Iron (1 sp)63–72 Lead (5 cp) 73–75 Mithral (100 gp)76–80 Platinum (500 gp) 81–95 Silver (5 gp) 96–100 Other 71–100 Textiles1 01 Cloth of gold (1,000 gp; 10 lb.) 02–04 Cloth of silver (100 gp; 10 lb.)05–34 Cotton (1 gp; 0.5 lb.) 35–44 Linen (4 gp; 1 lb.)45–47 Samite (250 gp; 5 lb.) 48–52 Satin (6 gp; 0.5 lb.)53–62 Silk (10 gp; 0.5 lb.) 63–70 Velvet (15 gp; 2 lb.) 71–95 Wool (2 gp; 2 lb.) 96–100 Other 1 Prices and weights given are per square yard. HOW BIG IS THE PILE? As the Player’s Handbook states, a typical coin weighs about one-third of an ounce (50 per pound). But how much space do coins take up, and how big a pile do they make when gathered into a hoard? And do dragons really sleep on bedsof coins? A typical coin measures slightly more than an inch in diam- eter and is approximately one-tenth of an inch thick. A cubicfoot (a volume 1 foot on each side) holds around 12,000 loosely stacked coins. Of course, coins aren’t usually stacked in cubic feet— they’re scattered about in piles. A cubic foot of coins fills anarea roughly 5 feet on a side to a depth of about 1/2 inch, or 3 feet on a side to a depth of 1 inch or so. That’s enoughspace for a Small dragon to wallow around on, and even a Medium dragon can derive enjoyment from reclining onsuch a pile. But larger dragons need an extraordinary number of coins to create a pile large enough to sleep on. A Large dragon needsat least 50,000 coins to create a “bed,” while a Huge dragon needs 100,000 or more. Gargantuan or Colossal dragons might require piles of a half million or more coins in order to createa true “bed.” And even then, this isn’t an enormous pile but little more than a relatively thin layer of coins. For this reason, most dragons don’t actually have beds com- posed entirely of coins (though some collect copper pieces forexactly this reason). Still, it’s nice to dream. . . .pqqqqrsMaybe some of the items are clearly stolen, and the PCs seek a reward by returning them to their rightful owners. GEMS Table 3–6: Gems on page 55 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide has a long list of gemstones and appropriate values. Thevalues given there are for cut and finished stones; uncut orrough gems are worth about one-third their finished value. A character with the Craft (gemcutting) skill can improve a rough gemstone’s value. The raw material cost is representedby the uncut stone. The check DC varies from 10 (for gem-stones worth up to 50 gp) to 15 (for gemstones worth 50 to 500gp) to 20 or higher (for gemstones worth more than 500 gp). At the DM’s option, a check that fails by 5 or more entirely ruins the uncut stone, forcing the character to start overwith a new stone. You can make gems more interesting by making them exotic or restricted. Perhaps the best pearls are retrieved ina certain bay by gnome divers, or maybe the elves controlthe emerald market. Maybe frost giants in your world usebloodstones for currency, suggesting that if the charactersstumble across a cache of bloodstones, it probably camefrom (or is headed to) frost giants in the area.ART OBJECTS Table 3–7: Art Objects on page 55 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide provides several examples of art objects to place as treasures.

In somecases, additional rolls on one or more tables may berequired, based on the type of object or the sort of materialit is made from. Many of the table entries include a parenthetical label, either H or S, indicating whether the object in question ismade of a hard material or a soft material. To determine theexact material, roll on Table A–10: Material (Hard) or TableA–11: Material (Soft) as appropriate. For additional flourishes, you can roll on Table A–12: Depictions or Table A–13: Embellishments. ITEMS Adding mundane items or magic items to a hoard is a goodway to spice it up. Dragons with Intelligence scores of 6 orhigher  are likely to use any items (mundane or magic) thatare in their hoards. For instance, a red dragon with a chestfull of flasks of alchemist’s fire might put the chest in aplace where its fiery breath could set the flammable sub-stance on fire. MUNDANE ITEMS Table 3–8: Mundane Items on page 56 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide has an extensive list of mundane (nonmagi- cal) items that can be found as part of a treasure hoard. Inaddition to these, you can include luxury items such as per-fume or incense. Roll d% or select from Table A–14: Mun-dane Luxury Items. Since the average value of the items onthis table is only a fraction of the average value of the itemsin Table 3–8 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide , roll 2d8 times on Table A–14 for each mundane item indicated by Table 3–5:Treasure in the Dungeon Master’s Guide .

MAGIC ITEMS It can be tempting to fill a dragon’s hoard with an assort- ment of magic items usable by the dragon itself, such asrings, bracers, potions, and rods. Unless the dragon hasready access to a nearby city in which to purchase such items, however, it probably shouldn’t be equipped as well asa typical NPC fighter or wizard. And while any intelligentdragon (one with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher)would be foolish to refrain from using a magic item to itsadvantage, unlike a typical NPC (whose power oftendepends on the gear he carries), the challenge a dragonposes derives primarily from its innate abilities, not thetreasure it has gathered. Except in special circumstances, a dragon probably shouldn’t use more than one or two magic items out of itshoard. Even if you randomly place useful items, most drag-ons don’t have the ability to identify magic items and thuscan’t easily determine what might or might not be useful.In addition, dragons have difficulty using many magicitems, especially weapons and armor. (See the Rules: Drag-ons and Magic Items sidebar in Chapter 1.) If you decide toequip your dragon with a variety of magic items, you mightconsider awarding an ad hoc XP bonus to the characters(anywhere from +10% to +50%, depending on the situation)for defeating it, since the presence of useful magic itemsprobably increases the difficulty of the encounter. Here’s a brief rundown of the utility of the various cate- gories of magic items.",

Packed into the pages of this bookare new dragon prestige classes, spells, feats, dragonlikemonsters, and full statistics for 120 sample dragons—all ten of the chromatic and metallic dragons at all 12age categories. This article presents one of the sampledragons from The Draconomicon along with her fully detailed lair. Sventsorggviresh, an old red dragon, is asuitable opponent for a 20th-level party. SVENTSORGGVIRESH’S VOLCANO LAIR Because Sventsorggviresh spends most of her time athome, player characters are most likely to encounterher in her lair. They might discover its location from ametallic dragon or by following Sventsorggviresh thereafter one of her hunting excursions. The lair is located in an area of widespread geother- mal activity. Numerous geysers, steam vents, and vol-canic calderas dot the land around her home. Partiessearching for the dragon’s lair may have to explore sev-eral small volcanoes before locating the correct one. LAIR FEATURES Unless noted otherwise in the text, the features insideSventsorggviresh’s lair are as follows. Alarms Sventsorggviresh has placed alarm effects throughout the lair to warn her of intruders. Every entrance to andexit from any chamber (including sinkholes and chim-neys) is protected by an alarm spell. Any opening too large to be covered by a single spell has enough addi-tional alarms to completely cover the area. Each spell warns Sventsorggviresh with a mental alarm when trig-gered. All the spells can be bypassed with the samepassword (“Hey, I belong here!” spoken in Ignan). In addition, each chamber and natural staircase has amagic mouth spell set to go off whenever anyone other than Sventsorggviresh or a mephit passes. The magic mouth says, “Where do you think you’re going?” in Common. Ceilings The ceilings in the chambers are 50 feet high, andthose in the corridors are 25 feet high. Chamber Openings Each major chamber in the lair has an opening leading tothe volcano’s central crater. Outside each of these 2openings is a lip of volcanic stone about 20 feet lower than the chamber floor that forms a sort of open terrace. Thesedrop-offs are shown on the map as raised ledges (thechamber floors) above cliff edges (the terraces). The cham-ber openings themselves are about 20 feet high, measur-ing from the top of the opening to the chamber floor. Floors The floors are made of natural volcanic rock. Like allnatural floors, they are extremely uneven and featuremany bumps and cracks. Entering any square on thefloor costs two squares of movement, and running orcharging across these floors is impossible. Light During the day, sunlight reaches the chambers throughthe volcano’s crater. Unless otherwise noted, however,only a little daylight reaches the corridors. Characterscan see normally in the chambers and about 30 feet inthe corridors (or 60 feet if they have low-light vision). At night, the glow of the lava pool (area 8) lights the lair’s chambers, allowing characters to see about 30 feet(or 60 feet if they have low-light vision). The corridorsare pitch-black at night. Temperature All areas within the lair are hot. The areas farthestfrom the lava pool are at least 80 °F. Those closer to the lava pool are hotter still, as given in the various areadescriptions. Sinkholes/Natural Chimneys These openings lead to small lava tubes. Unless other-wise noted, a sinkhole has a funnel-shaped mouthabout 5 feet wide at floor level, which narrows to about2 feet at the bottom. A chimney is just an inverted sink-hole located in a ceiling. Each sinkhole or chimney connects with a tube about 2 feet wide. Medium or larger creatures cannotfit through the tubes, but smaller creatures can wigglethrough. The tubes corkscrew throughout the vol-cano’s interior, connecting with other sinkholes andchimneys here and there. Each sinkhole or chimney onthe map bears a label noting where it leads. The tubes are shot through with vents that periodi- cally spurt magma or superheated vapor. Visibilityinside a tube is 0 feet because of the thick vapor and thelack of light. Contact with the hot rock and vapor insidethe tubes deals 2d6 points of heat damage per round. Vision Several areas within the lair allow only restrictedvision. Creatures have partial concealment (10% misschance) at the indicated distance and total concealment (50% miss chance and opponents cannot use sight tolocate) beyond that. Walls Like the floors, the walls are made of unworked vol-canic stone. They are not only very uneven, but alsodamp with condensation and often covered with fungi.Because of all these conditions, the walls have a ClimbDC of 20 unless otherwise noted. SVENTSORGGVIRESH’S TACTICS Sventsorggviresh normally sleeps atop her hoard inarea 6, though you can choose to place her anywhereyou wish within the lair when the PCs arrive. She mostlikely knows intruders are within her lair long beforethey have any idea where she is, thanks to her keensenses, her mephit allies, and her magical defenses. The dragon relishes melee combat, especially with creatures weaker and smaller than herself. Before set-ting out to search for prey or confront creatures invad-ing her lair, she usually casts cat’s grace on herself. Then she uses invisibility , followed by haste and protection from energy (cold). Once so prepared, she moves in for a closer look. If possible, she attacks intruders when they reach area 4, hoping to drive them toward the sinkhole inarea 5. Most of area 4 is protected by a forbiddance spell that leaves only a single passage leading from theentrance to area 5 open. A few well-placed walls of force may help her force the party that direction if theymanage to bypass the forbiddance. Sventsorggviresh begins her attack by casting true strike . Then she charges and delivers a bite augmented with Power Attack. She usually selects an unarmoredopponent in midst of an opposing group for this attack,so as to have as many foes as possible within reach foruse of the Cleave feat. Should the foes withstand her initial attack, Sventsorggviresh defensively casts deeper darkness, then maneuvers so that she can either deliver her breathweapon the next round or get as many foes withinmelee reach as possible. She tries to eliminate any foesthat seem particularly troublesome with hold monster or phantasmal killer . The dragon also likes to use confusion to break up organized groups of foes. If subjected tocold attacks, she uses fire shield (hot flames) to help counter them and renews her protection from energy spell as necessary. If need be, Sventsorggviresh attacks invaders else- where in her lair. For such battles, she prefers to use3hit-and-run tactics. She typically swoops into a cham- ber to deliver a breath weapon or spell, them withdrawstoward area 4 before returning for another pass. Even the main chambers in her lair offer Sventsorggviresh little room to maneuver while she isin flight, so she usually flies out over the lava pool (area8) when she needs to turn. To reverse direction in thechambers, she either uses her Wingover feat or simplylands and turns around. ENTRANCES Physical entrances to the lair include the top of the vol-canic crater (area 1), a twisting passage leading to area 2,and a magma-filled vent under the lava pool (area 8). 1. CRATER RIM (EL 10 OR 20) This area is shown only in the side view of the lair, asgiven on the map. The rim rises about 800 feet abovethe surrounding terrain and 325 feet above the lavapool in area 8. Thanks to the glow from the lava pool,characters can see the crater’s interior from here at anytime of the day or night.The characters can linger here for as long as they wish, but any visible character at the crater rim brings aswarm of mephits to investigate.",

Even here, the heat from the lava is like aphysical presence. It rises in faintly visible waves,like heat from a hot stove on a winter day. Six very large openings, each 40 feet wide or more, are arranged along the interior of the shaftlike steps in spiral staircase. A lip of black, hard-ened lava lies below each opening. pqqqqrs pqqqqrsSVENTSORGGVIRESH’S POWER-UP If Sventsorggviresh has a chance to use all herpreparatory spells ( cat’s grace, haste, invisibility, and protection from energy [cold] ), her statistics change as follows: Init +2; Spd 70 ft., fly 230 ft.

In addition, her true strike spell gives her an extra +20 insight bonus on her first attack roll, and thatattack ignores any miss chances that would nor- mally apply. The hot fire shield effect reduces any cold damage that Sventsorggviresh would take by half, and if thecold attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, shetakes no damage at all on a successful save. Her pro- tection from energy spell absorbs any cold damage remaining after the effects of the fire shield have been applied (up to a maximum of 120 points). The fire shield also deals 1d6+7 points of damage to anyone striking Sventsorggviresh with a natural weapon or amelee weapon (unless the latter has reach).4 5Critical (claw), Overwhelming Critical (claw), Power Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw), Wingover. Breath W eapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, Sventsorggviresh can breathe a 60-foot cone of fire.Each creature in the area takes 16d10 points of firedamage (Reflex DC 31 half). Crush (Ex): Whenever Sventsorggviresh flies or jumps, she can land on opponents as a standard action,using her whole body to crush them.

        "description":  "2gloves of storing, necklace of adapta- tion, ring of swimming, wand of chaos hammer (caster level 8th, 28 charges), wand of fire shield (22 charges).Tactics: Sventsorggviresh, if present, tries to ambush the PCs by becoming invisible and then usingher breath weapon, as noted in the section above onher general tactics. After her initial attack, she flies toarea 4 and lies in wait for the PCs. The mephits make a casual approach from the depths of the crater, doing nothing to conceal them-selves from the party. They simply ride the heat wavesrising from the lava pool, turning in lazy circles. Whenthey reach the crater rim, they invite the characters todive right in, assuring them that the lava is fine. Themephits do not intend to fight the characters; theyleave that to Sventsorggviresh. If Sventsorggviresh is present, the mephits arrive at the top after she has started her assault. They simplytake up positions along the rim and watch the fight. If the dragon is not there, the mephits are happy to chat with the party. If questioned, they confirm thatthis mountain is the home of a red dragon. They tellthe characters that the dragon can be found in one ofthe chambers, and even offer to lead the party there. Ifasked for directions, the mephits point out the caveopening to area 4. Should the characters indicate a pref-erence for walking, the mephits scoff but the direct theparty to the passage leading into area 2. The mephits willingly describe the whole lair if asked, though they claim there’s not much to tell. The lair, theysay, has six hot, steamy chambers, including the secretroom where the dragon dwells. In response to questionsabout where this secret chamber lies, they give directionsto area 5. (In fact, area 5 is not a chamber at all; it’s just apassage with a big sinkhole in the floor. Sventsorggvireshactually spends most of her time in area 6.) The mephits claim to hate the dragon because she is both haughty and domineering. (Both of these adjec-tives describe Sventsorggviresh well, but the mephitsexpect as much and don’t really mind.) They claim thatthe dragon has disguised the entrance to her innersanctum as a simple hole in the ground. (This state-ment isn’t true; the mephits know that the sinkhole inarea 5 is Sventsorggviresh’s disposal chute forunwanted visitors.) The mephits also warn the partythat powerful magic guards the dragon’s lair, but theyoffer a secret password (“Sventsorggviresh tri-umphant”) that they claim allows safe passage. Theseassertions are true, as far as they go. Area 4 is warded byaforbiddance spell that is keyed to that phrase (though it must be spoken in Ignan—a fact that the mephits con-veniently leave out). Sventsorggviresh’s lair in area 6 isalso protected by forbiddance , but that ward has a differ- ent password (see area 6).6Once the party leaves the rim and enters the lair, the mephits quickly go to area 6 to warn Sventsorggviresh.(After all, it never hurts to be on a dragon’s good side,even if the dragon in question doesn’t really have one.)Unless the party seems particularly unwary, themephits first go to area 2, then travel to areas 7 and 6through the connecting sinkholes. If the charactersdetain the mephits, other mephits from areas 2 and 3notice their comrades’ plight and give the warninginstead. 2. UPPER CAVERN (EL VARIABLE) Groups traveling on foot can reach this area through atwisting passage that leads here from the volcano’swestern slopes. This chamber lies 300 feet above the lava pool. The temperature is about 100 °F. The mephits refer to this cavern as “the Icehouse,” since it seems cold to them. The items stacked hereconstitute the mephits’ treasure hoard. These creatures accompany the dragon when she sacks any structure that might contain items of value,and it is they who go inside the burning buildings andcollect the treasure. Sventsorggviresh seizes anythingof real value that the mephits may find, but she allowsthem to keep most of the food, drink, clothing, andother sundries. She insists, however, that they storetheir loot here.",

MEPHIT COLONY (EL 10) All the three-dozen-odd mephits who dwell inSventsorggviresh’s lair call this chamber home,though there are seldom more than a dozen here atany one time. The crevasse in this chamber is only an inch or two wide, but it constantly belches steam and sulfurousvapors. Vision in this chamber is restricted to 20 feet,and the temperature is 120 °F (hot enough to damage characters after 10 minutes of exposure, as noted in theDungeon Master’s Guide ).

CAVERN OF THE WYRM (EL 20 OR 0) This area is protected by a forbiddance effect and con- tains a programmed image of an attacking dragon. In addition, Sventsorggviresh is lying in wait here for thecharacters if she has been warned of their approach. The temperature in this chamber is 150 °F (hot enough to damage characters after 1 minute of expo-sure, as noted in the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). The forbiddance effect covers the entire cavern except for a passage extending north and south fromthe westernmost column (the square in the northernportion of the cavern) the entire vertical length of thecavern. It also covers the entire terrace. The dragonwants to channel visitors toward area 5, so she has leftthe straightest path to that area open.This dingy cavern reeks of spoiled food, spilled alcohol, and burnt herbs. An untidy heap ofcrates, barrels, and other containers stands nearone wall. Several winged creatures lounge on thepile, eating and drinking. Three gaping holes yawn in the uneven floor, and the wide cave mouth admits a lurid, vol-canic glow.7The forbiddance ward does not deal damage, but only creatures that speak the password “Sventsorggvireshtriumphant” in Ignan can enter the warded area. Theeffect also prevents all teleportation and planar travelinto or out of that area. The forbiddance effect was created by a 13th-level lawful evil cleric. Whenever anyone except a mephit or Sventsorggviresh enters area 4, a programmed image goes into action, creating the following illusion. The head appears to be that of a Colossal dragon, though Sventsorggviresh is only Gargantuan. Anycharacter may make a Spellcraft check to determinethat the arcane syllables were the verbal component ofawall of force spell.",

A crea-ture with a fly speed is allowed a DC 24 Reflex saveeach round to escape the whirlwind. The creature stilltakes damage but can leave if the save is successful.The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racialadjustment. A creature trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where Azuria carries it or to escape thewhirlwind. It can otherwise act normally but mustmake a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. A creature caught in the whirlwind takes a–4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. Azuria can have only as many creatures trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside thewhirlwind’s volume. She can eject any carried creatureswhenever she wishes, depositing them wherever thewhirlwind happens to be. If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it cre- ates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centeredon Azuria and has a diameter equal to half the whirl-wind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, includ-ing darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet awayhave concealment, while those farther away havetotal concealment. Anyone caught in the cloud mustsucceed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spelllevel) to cast a spell. While in whirlwind form, Azuriacannot make melee attacks and does not threaten thearea around her. Plane SShift(Sp):Azuria can enter any of the elemen- tal planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. Thisability transports her and up to eight other creatures,provided they all link hands with her. This effect isotherwise similar to the spell of the same name (casterlevel 13th).

Scythia is a rarity—ahalf-dragon/half-wyvern born of a metallic dragonparent. Scythia never knew her wyvern father, and hermother told her nothing about him. Scythia often sus-pects that her hatching was a surprise to her motherand wonders why her egg wasn’t crushed in the nest. Today, bereft of both parents, Scythia wanders alone in the wilderness, seeking her own place in the world.Though a bit slow-witted, she realizes that she doesn’tfit in with her father’s kind or with any of the metallicdragons.7DScythia:Female half-brass dragon/half-wyvern; CR 8; Large dragon; HD 7d12+21; hp 66; Init +1; Spd 20ft., fly 60 ft.

KALIVIA, HALF-BLUE DRAGON/ HALF-YUAN-TI  ABOMINATION A small faction among the yuan-ti seeks to increase the race’s power by strengthening bloodlines. One forward-thinking abomination in this group bargained with ablue dragon to bear his young, believing that the off-spring would become natural leaders who could takethe serpent folk to even greater heights of power. He was partially correct. Soon after the eggs hatched, the half-dragon spawn displayed even greaterphysical and mental abilities than their father had.However, they also had a disturbing tendency to slayone another. Only one of the children, Kalivia by name,survived to reach the age of six. By maturity, she hadmurdered her father and set up an organized inter-breeding program between yuan-ti and dragonkind.Though the program is yet in its infancy, Kalivia plansto create an army of dragonspawn to wipe the conti-nent clean of humanoid infestation.DKalivia:Female half-blue dragon/half-yuan-ti abomination; CR 9; Large dragon; HD 9d10+36; hp 85;Init +5; Spd 30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 26,touch 10, flat-footed 25; Base Atk +9; Grp +21; Atk +16melee (1d6+8, claw) or +17 melee (1d8+8/18–20, mas-terwork scimitar) or +10 ranged (2d6+8/ /H115033, master- work composite longbow [+8 Str bonus]); Full Atk +16melee (1d6+8, 2 claws) and +11 melee (2d6+4 pluspoison, bite) or +17/+12 melee (1d8+8/18–20, master-work scimitar) and +11 melee (2d6+4 plus poison,bite) or +10/+5 ranged (2d6+8/ /H115033, masterwork com- posite longbow [+8 Str bonus]); Space/Reach 10 ft./10ft.; SA aversion, breath weapon (60-ft. line of light- ning), constrict 1d6+12, improved grab, poison, pro- duce acid, spell-like abilities; SQ alternate form, chameleon power, darkvision 60 ft., detect poison, immunities (electricity, paralysis, sleep), low-lightvision, scent, spell resistance 18; AL LE; SV Fort +7,Ref +7, Will +11; Str 27, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 22, Wis 20, Cha 20.",

Affected creaturesmust stay at least 20 feet away from any snake or yuan-ti, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet, they moveaway . A subject unable to move away, or one attacked bysnakes or yuan-ti, is overcome with revulsion. Thisrevulsion reduces the creature’s Dexterity score by 4points until the effect wears off or the subject is nolonger within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti. This abilityis otherwise similar to antipathy as the spell (caster level 16th). Breath WWeapon ((Su):Once per day, Kalivia can breathe a 60-foot line of lightning.

This ability issimilar to a polymorph spell (caster level 19th), but Kalivia does not regain any hit points for changing formand she can assume only viper forms. Kalivia loses hernatural weapons and gains the natural weapon of the viper form she assumes. She uses her own poison or theviper’s with her bite attack, whichever is more potent. Chameleon PPower(Sp):Kalivia can psionically change her own coloration and that of her equipmentto match her surroundings, granting her a +10 circum-stance bonus on Hide checks.

All dvati are born identical twins, with the pair sharing a single soul between them. Dvati lore holds that their souls are so powerful that a single, mortal vessel is too weak to contain them. Thus, their minds occupy two bodies. Typically peaceful folk, dvati are concerned more with philosophy and art than material pleasures. Much of their culture centers on the close link between a dvati pair. A pair of twins might paint a mural together, with each twin starting from one end and meeting at the middle to finish the creation. Dvati twins debate philosophy with each other with an eye toward not only uncovering higher truths but also questioning and exploring their own beliefs, attitudes, and preconceptions. While dvati enjoy intellectual pursuits, they are capable warriors and hard workers. They consider archery, fencing, and similar combat talents art forms worthy of study.

Scott, DRAGON #317, March 2004 Experts at finding solutions to puzzles that baffle even the greatest minds, cerebrexes also possess awesome intellectual powers that strike fear in the hearts of other Spellcasters. Cerebrexes follow a path to enhance the human central nervous system—not merely the brain, but the eyes, the spine, and the senses—using magic. Those who follow this path are great thinkers and problem solvers. They are respected and feared for their ability to control not only their own minds, but also the minds of others. Cerebrexes are typically seen as aloof, absent-minded, and unaware of their surroundings. In fact, they are often so aware of their surroundings and have remembered so many facts that they simply forget—or do not care—to interact with the people around them.

Similar items have the same or nearly the same shape and weight within 50% of each other. Similar items must also share a material in their construction that constitutes at least half of their form. For example, the shaper of form can transform a scimitar into a longsword, since both are swords that weight the same. She cannot change a dagger into a short sword, for example, because a short sword weighs twice as much as a dagger. The shaper of form could also change a set of leather armor into a set of studded leather but not a chain shirt (because the chain shirt is made of steel and not leather). Sometimes, overall improvements can be made, but the value of the item cannot increase by more than double its original worth. This change is permanent and cannot be dispelled or otherwise removed by any means short of a wish or miracle. This effect requires a full-round action to use and the shaper of form must touch the item in question in order to affect it. She can attempt to change an item in another creature\u0027s possession, but the item gets a Fortitude save (DC 10 + shaper of form level) to resist the effect.

        "description":  " F eats are one of the most popular aspects of third edition DUNGEONS \u0026 DRAGONS. This chapter presents a selection of new feats, including metamagic feats and a new type of feat called bloodline feats. Bloodline Feats Bloodline feats are designed with sorcerers in mind, although any character who meets the prerequisites can choose them. Each of the base feats in this category (the ones with the word \"bloodline\" in their names) grants a character the bloodline of a particular kind of magical creature, plus a specific set of extra arcane spells known. If more than one of her classes allows her to cast arcane spells without preparation, the character must decide to which list of spells known the spells granted by the base bloodline feat are added when the it is chosen. Choosing such a feat represents not only having a particular sort of ancestor but also coming to terms with that heritage sufficiently to benefit from it. A character may choose only one base bloodline feat. The description of each base bloodline feat offers guidelines on how that ancestry might affect the character\u0027s personality, appearance, and spell selection. The player is free to use or ignore any of these suggestions, as desired. While ancestry does influence who you are and what you do, it is not the only telling feature of your character—or even the primary one. Each base bloodline feat is the foundation of a short feat tree—that is, other bloodline feats (those with the bloodline type but that do not have \"bloodline\" in their names) require it as a prerequisite. These additional feats represent a sorcerer\u0027s continuing mastery of her heritage. In addition, some bloodline feats are general enough that any character who has taken a base bloodline feat (regardless of which one) can acquire them. The base bloodline feats are most advantageous when taken in conjunction with the character\u0027s first level of sorcerer (or another class that casts spells in the same manner), but they can also prove beneficial TABLE 4-1: FEAT SUMMARY FEAT NAME PREREQUISITES BENEFITS Air Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Anarchic Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Axiomatic Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Celestial Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Celestial Light Celestial Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level Cast light five times per day arcane spells Draconic Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Dragon Sight Draconic Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level Cast detect magic three times per day arcane spells Earth Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Fey Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Fey\u0027s Fate Fey Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level +1 bonus on saves arcane spells Fiendish Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Fire Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Friend of the Earth Earth Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level or +3 to Climb and Tumble on stone higher arcane spells Illithid Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Kin Mastery Any bloodline feat, ability to cast 3rd-level Turn/rebuke ancestors once per day arcane spells Lawful Discipline Axiomatic Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level +2 save vs. mind-affecting arcane spells Mind Weapon Illithid Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level Cast daze three times per day arcane spells Necromantic Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Bloodline Penumbra Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Plant Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Power in the Blood Any bloodline feat, ability to cast 3rd-level Cast one extra bloodline spell per day arcane spells Serpent Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Water Bloodline Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation Sorcerous bloodline grants extra spells Ability Enhancer Spell Focus (transmutation) Increase ability score bonus from spells Astral Tracking Knowledge (the planes) 11 ranks, Spellcraft Track on Astral Plane 8 ranks, Survival 10 ranks, Track Braced for Charge F Base attack +1 Set any polearm against charge Charming Cha 13, Negotiator +3 on Charisma checks made to control charmed creatures Circle Master F Dodge, Circle Student, Concentration 4 ranks, Circle Student bonus increases to +2 base attack bonus +8 Circle Student F Dodge, Concentration 2 ranks, base +1 attack and AC against focused attack bonus +4 opponent, AC penalty against others Combat Charm Wis 13 Deny save bonus on charm spells in combat Commanding Cha 14, Persuasive +1 DC on compulsion spells Cuthbert\u0027s Smite Patron deity St. Cuthbert, smite evil Extra use of smite evil, smite chaotic targets Cutpurse Improved Unarmed Strike, Sleight of Hand Disguise Sleight of Hand attempt as 5 ranks combat maneuvers Dead EyeF Dex 17, base attack bonus +14, Point Add Dexterity bonus to ranged damage Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (any ranged weapon).
