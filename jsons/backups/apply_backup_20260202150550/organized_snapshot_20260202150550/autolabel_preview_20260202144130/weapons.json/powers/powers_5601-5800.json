SKILLS Skill use is essential to every adventurer’s career, from the burly ﬁ  ghter who specializes only in climbing to the genius-intellect wizard with ranks in every Knowledge skill. COMBINING SKILL ATTEMPTS Teamwork is an oft-overlooked element of the D\u0026D game. It’s all too easy for the ﬁ  ghter to pay attention only when it’s time to swing his sword, or for the cleric to tune out during the rogue’s attempt to bluff the party past a guard post, but these characters are ignoring valuable opportunities to contribute to the group’s suc- cess. In addition to the aid another rule (see page 65 of the Player’s Handbook ), this section describes some new ways for characters to help their friends succeed.t takes more than just muscle or the ability to sling a spell to survive life as an adventurer. Regardless of how swiftly or accurately you swing a sword, or how devastatingly powerful your spells are, adventures invariably pose problems and challenges that require quick thinking, versatile abilities, and a little luck to survive. This chapter explores alternate uses for many skills, providing many new ways in which characters can use existing skill ranks to overcome different challenges. Skills, although one of the main focuses of this book, are but part of a character’s many abilities. The feats in this chapter speak to the versatility of the accomplished adventurer. Whether you’re a ﬁ  ghter wanting to handle tasks other than a toe-to-toe melee or a rogue looking to boost your combat ability, these new feats help shape a character into a more versatile, more durable adven-turer. Many of the feats emphasize skill use, opening up new ways to use existing skill ranks that would be too powerful to simply give to every character. Others focus on the rogue’s, ninja’s, and scout’s special attack forms. Finally, subsets of feats offer expanded uses for 95Illus. by D. KovacsCHAPTER 3 SKILLS AND FEATS 96CHAPTER 3 SKILLS AND FEATS 97Individual Events Even in some cases where several characters attempt the same action, with each succeeding or failing as a result of separate checks, characters can assist one another. By offering advice, guidance, or simply leading by example, a character can effectively share some of her expertise with her comrades. However, this activity comes at a cost, since the character’s concentration is split between multiple tasks (and thus she isn’t as capable at the task as she would normally be). A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill who is engaged in a task using that skill can voluntarily accept a –4 penalty on the check in order to grant a +2 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue can help her allies sneak through a dungeon. By accepting a –4 penalty on her Hide and Move Silently checks, Lidda grants Jozan, Tordek, and Mialee each a +2 circumstance bonus on the same checks. While Lidda isn’t as quiet and hidden as she’d normally be, the group overall is more stealthy than they would be without her help. At higher levels, a character can grant more assistance, but at a greater cost. A character with 15 or more ranks in a skill can accept a –10 penalty on the check to grant a +5 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. An ally must be within 30 feet of you to gain the bonus, and you must be able to see and hear each other. Using the previous example, if Lidda were invisible, she couldn’t grant the bonus to any character who couldn’t see her; if Mialee were invisible, Lidda couldn’t grant her the bonus unless she could see invisible creatures (but she could still grant the bonus to the other characters). Typically, only the following skills can be assisted in this manner: Balance, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Hide, Move Silently, Ride, Search, Survival, and Swim. In special circumstances, the DM may rule that other skills can beneﬁt from this assistance, or that characters can’t beneﬁt from this form of assistance even when using the skills described above. Aid Another The Player’s Handbook  describes how a character can help another character achieve success by aiding him with a skill check of the same type; a successful DC 10 check by the ﬁrst character grants a +2 circumstance bonus on the second character’s check to use the same skill (see pages 65–66 of the Player’s Handbook ). This section expands on that rule by allowing more skilled characters to grant greater assistance. When a character with 5 or more ranks in a skill uses the aid another action to assist another character’s skill check, he can grant a higher bonus than that described in the Player’s Handbook . For every 10 points of the helper’s check result above 10, the circumstance bonus increases by 1. Thus, a result of 10–19 would grant a +2 circumstance bonus (as normal), a result of 20–29 would grant a +3 circumstance bonus, a result of 30–39 a +4 circumstance bonus, and so on. (To determine the circumstance bonus quickly, simply divide the helper’s check result by 10, round down, and add 1.) This higher bonus is available only to helpers with at least 5 ranks in the skill being used. Only experienced characters have the ability to provide the extra assistance offered by this rule. At the DM’s option, this rule can also be extended to using the aid another action in combat to improve an ally’s attack roll or AC. Any character with a base attack bonus of +5 or higher can grant a greater bonus on an ally’s attack roll or AC as described above. This rule rewards the tactic of experienced combatants helping each other in a ﬁght (often the best option when ﬁghting a monster with an extremely high AC or attack bonus). Skill Synergy In addition to helping a character’s own skill checks, skill synergies can be used to aid the checks of allies as well. A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill that offers a bonus on another skill due to synergy can make a check using the ﬁrst skill to aid the skill that would normally receive the bonus from synergy. For example, Soveliss the 2nd-level ranger could make a Handle Animal check to aid Jozan’s Ride check (using the aid another rules described above and in the Player’s Handbook ), because a character with 5 ranks in Handle Animal gains a +2 bonus on Ride checks due to synergy. See Table 4–5: Skill Synergies, page 66 of the Player’s Handbook . The normal rules for aiding another still apply. For instance, even if Krusk the barbarian had 5 ranks in Handle Animal, he couldn’t use it to aid Vadania the druid’s wild empathy check, because Krusk can’t make a wild empathy check himself. Some combinations may be difﬁcult to imagine, but the DM should allow any synergistic aid another attempt that seems reasonable. For instance, it might seem odd at ﬁrst glance for Mialee to use Spellcraft to assist Lidda’s Use Magic Device check when reading a scroll—until you imagine the wizard leaning over the rogue’s shoulder, helping her sound out the tougher words.EXPANDED SKILL DESCRIPTIONS The section below outlines new and clariﬁed uses for some of the skills in the D\u0026D game.

When swallowed, the liquid quickens the imbiber’s stride for a short time, providing a temporary boost of speed at the cost of leaving the user fatigued. A swiftstride capsule increases the user’s base land speed by 5 feet. This beneﬁ  t lasts for 2 rounds, at the end of which time the user becomes fatigued.

Using an alchemical weapon capsule requires only a swift action (and does not provoke attacks of opportu- nity) if it is held in a properly attached weapon capsule retainer (see below). Otherwise, applying an alchemical weapon capsule is the equivalent of applying a magic oil (a standard action that does provoke attacks of opportunity).",

This long leather thong, wrapped around a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (but not a projectile weapon) just at the base of the blade or striking surface, holds a thin, ﬁ  tted ring sized for a single alchemical capsule. A more expensive option is the triple weapon capsule retainer, which stores three capsules rather than one. A character wielding a weapon with a triple retainer can use one, two, or all three capsules it holds as part of the same action. Only one weapon capsule retainer (or triple retainer) can be attached to any weapon.

First, you resolve attacks with your spectral weapon as melee touch attacks instead of melee attacks. Second, any foe you hit is entitled to a Will save to recognize the weapon’s shadowy nature. If the save is successful, that oppo- nent takes only one-ﬁ  fth normal damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 20% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon). You can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell’s duration expires, whichever comes ﬁ  rst. SPEECHLINK",

Some members limit themselves to tracking down criminals; others are willing to hunt anyone for a client who can pay the price.

Bloodhounds can take any assignments they choose. Some jobs come directly from clients who contact indi- vidual members. Others come through the grapevine, since members pass word to each other. Individuals are ﬁ  ercely competitive, and if one succeeds where another has failed, the winner gloats over the victory. In fact, members often tell each other about the as-signments they’ve taken, in effect challenging to beat them to the mark (their quarry). Mem- b er s may work together, but most work alone or with nonmembers so that word spreads of their personal fame. Thus, whenever several Bloodhounds form a pos- se to catch a particularly elusive foe, word spreads far and wide. Despite this rivalry, when a mark is too important to go free, a member can spread the word of a “free” bounty among the Bloodhounds. This means that any member who brings in the mark can claim the prize. Members who spread free bounties lose no face in the organization for doing so. Bloodhounds resent the concept of giving their earn-ings to anyone. Thus, the organization does not demand a portion of its members’ income. No ofﬁ  cial guildhalls or strongholds exist because no self-respecting member would limit herself to one base of operations. Since so many of the group’s marks are human, rang-ers who have taken humans as favored enemies have an advantage in assignments. As a result, a large percentage of the membership is nonhuman, and differing alignments are rarely an impediment to teaming up.

EYES OF THE OVERKING As one of the premier information-gathering and espio - nage groups in the world, the Eyes of the Overking are respected and even feared by the few who know they exist. Born in service to a legend, the guild devotes itself to preparing the world for the return of the Overking, a near-mythical ﬁgure who supposedly once held the human, elf, and dwarf people united as one nation for hundreds of years. The Eyes focus on espionage and information-gathering because their teachings hold that they will be responsible for helping the newly risen Overking see the world as it really is and for keeping him apprised of the most important matters while he builds and protects a new united realm. In practical terms, the Eyes of the Overking stray far from these roots and remain the most effective intelli - gence organization for several neighboring kingdoms. The guild holds that these kingdoms are the lost fragments of the Overking’s great kingdom, but that fact (if it’s true) has little meaning to the rulers of the realms. These rulers cau - tiously pay the organization for its excellent intelligence work and its apparently loyal stance on national issues. Although the kingdoms that the Eyes serve occasionally Dragonblade Ninja Clan symbolIllus. by C.

Eventually the silver dragon’s eggs hatched, and as the dragons matured they learned of their great debt to the family. The young dragons left, and many human generations passed before one returned with a gift. Now grown to great power, the dragon Silverwing offered knowledge of the ﬁghting techniques of a long-lost group of warriors who had mastered subtle skills. After long periods of training under Silverwing’s tutelage, the new family warriors began to exact their vengeance for crimes long forgotten by the rest of the empire. They earned the name dragonblade ninjas from those few bystanders who saw them ﬁght and lived to speak of it afterward. Within a few years, every last descendant of the traitorous prince had been killed, and the family’s vengeance was complete. His debt repaid, Silverwing left the family to make his own choices about his role in the world. Gen - erations later, the family still remains in hiding, although it now recruits a few trusted individuals into its ranks every few years. Without the dragon’s guidance or the burning quest of vengeance to drive it, however, the family’s will has fragmented, and its warriors pursue diverse and sometimes conﬂicting goals. Some wish to reveal themselves and claim their right as a prominent family. Others wish to remain in hiding and use their skills for proﬁt and adventure. Still others take an even more sinister path, selling their lethal skills as assassins to anyone who can pay their high fees.",
