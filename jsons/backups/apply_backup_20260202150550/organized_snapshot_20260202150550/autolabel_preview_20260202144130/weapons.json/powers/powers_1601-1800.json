A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. (This attack of oppor- tunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.) Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less. For example, an ogre with a Large longspear could strike with the longspear at opponents 15 or 20 feet away, but not at those 5 or 10 feet away. COMBAT MODIFIERS Sometimes you just have to go toe-to-toe in a fight, but you can usually gain some advantage by seeking a better position, either offensively or defensively. This section covers the rules for when you can line up a particularly good attack or are forced to make a disadvantageous one. FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS Depending on the situation, you may gain bonuses or take penalties on your attack roll. Generally, any situational modifier created by the attacker’s position or tactics applies to the attack roll, while any situational modifier created by the defender’s position, state, or tactics applies to the defender’s AC. Your DM judges what bonuses and penalties apply, using Table 8–5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8–6: Armor Class Modifiers as guides. COVER One of the best defenses available is cover. By taking cover behind a tree, a wall, the side of a wagon, or the battlements of a castle, you can protect yourself from attacks, especially ranged attacks, and also from being spotted. To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC). sq 150 :8 RETPAHC TABMOC Table 8–5: Attack Roll Modifiers Table 8–6: Armor Class Modifiers Attacker is . . .
