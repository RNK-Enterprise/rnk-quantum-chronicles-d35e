ELOCATER Elocaters are renowned for their agile combat stratagems, using their knowledge of motion and space to set them- selves up for quick attacks against slower opponents.

Strahd calls himself the “fi rst vampire,” but the claim seems unlikely. The details of his story are set down in the Tome of Strahd, with key excerpts presented on page 22. Strahd is a tall man, standing just over 6 feet. His body is lean and hard, and his gaunt face has strong features and prominent cheekbones. His eyes are dark and hypnotic, like deep pools with subtle refl ections of red light, but when he is enraged they burn like red-hot coals. His skin is usually pale, but it becomes fl ushed with each feeding and retains that healthy-looking color for several hours. His elongated and thin fi ngers have long, sharp nails. His fangs are not obvious unless he wants them to be noticed—he can speak and even yawn without revealing his true nature. When he attacks, however, the fangs lengthen to protrude from his mouth.

KAVAN THE GRIM Strahd has been experi- menting to create vampire minions with the ability to move about in daylight. He might even be planning to create a population of the daywalker breed (see Strahd’s Dynasty on page 15). Among the fi rst of these creations, Kavan the Grim is a savage brute who relishes his new ability to cause mayhem under the noonday sun. His ferocity makes him a poor covert spy, but he can accurately report on the PCs’ combat abilities. Kavan hurries toward the party at top speed, making no effort at stealth—once he closes to 90 feet, the PCs notice his approach. On his fi rst turn in combat, Kavan rages and moves to attack the nearest character. He fi ghts until he drops to 0 hit points, then drifts off in gaseous form toward the crypts beneath Castle Ravenloft. Kavan’s daylight attack should be a clear warning to the PCs that they are not up against any normal vampire foe. Unlike Strahd, though, Kavan suffers from the normal vampire aversions.

The inside of the church is lit only dimly by candles. Treat this as shadowy illumination: Creatures have concealment (20% miss chance) and can attempt Hide checks. The church interior is a shambles, with overturned and broken benches littering the dusty fl oor. A claw-scarred altar broods at the north end of the church, directly north of a gaping hole in the rotten fl oorboards. A hoarse voice coming from that same direction chants the phrases of a nonsense prayer. RUNNING THIS ENCOUNTER When the PCs open the doors to the church, no enemies are immediately visible. If anyone enters, ask the players to place their characters inside or outside the church; any PCs inside should be no more than 10 feet from the entrance. Roll initiative for all the monsters, but do not place them until their turn in the initiative order. On their initiative, the infected zombies (Z) and the deathlock (DL) open the doors and attack. The old priest, Danovich (D), jumps up from behind the altar where he was praying.",

        "description":  " A musty stench greets you as you emerge from the waterfall into a cave behind it. A sheet of water roars over the mouth of the cave, spraying a fi ne mist into the air. A brown bear the size of a man stands motionless on its hind legs at the other side of the cave. Deeper in, the cavern widens and rises into a larger cave above and behind this one. Varikov stuffed a smallish brown bear (B) and posed it erect on its hind legs near the entrance of the cave to frighten unwelcome visitors. When the PCs get close enough to make out details of Varikov’s appearance, read the following text: This dwarf’s face is twisted in a lunatic rage, his mouth contorted in a sadistic smile. He wears a chain shirt and swings an axe in each hand. A necklace of teeth hangs around his neck, clattering as he moves—and clearly including human teeth as well as more bestial fangs. Varikov’s Tactics Varikov’s darkvision allows him to see almost all of the large cavern from his position at the workbench. If he hears intruders, he blows a soft whistle to Farkash and slowly, quietly moves toward the rope bridge across the chasm while drawing and loading his crossbow. He fi res at the fi rst PC to enter the cave, then draws his waraxe and charges across the bridge. Varikov uses his Surge of Malevolence ability on his fi rst melee attack. Varikov and Farkash coordinate their attacks, using fl anking and trying to maneuver foes into the chute trap or the chasm. Both fi ght to the death.

That fact means that the PCs (or most of them) can’t get across the opening by making long jumps (PH 77), since a certain amount of vertical space is necessary for this tactic to succeed. For an added level of diffi culty, have Varikov cut the ropes holding up the bridge once he has charged across the bridge into the eastern chamber—now, in order for the PCs to get to Varikov’s inner sanctum without negotiating the chasm, they need to take the southern passage and risk exposing themselves to the chute trap. 83 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR HH22 Farkash CR — HP 13 ___________________________________________________ Wolf animal companion N Medium animal Init +2; Senses low-light vision, scent; Listen +3, Spot +3 AC 14, touch 12, flat-footed 12 HD 2 Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +1 Speed 50 ft.

If it can steal a PC’s essence, either by using a touch attack against a PC with few hit points left or by incapacitating a foe with its ego whip and using a standard action to steal that char- acter’s essence, it does so in preference to attacking another character. It employs its most powerful abilities (its spell-like abilities usable three times per day) against characters who seriously anger it, either by using tricky maneuvers or deal- ing more than 20 points of damage with a single attack. 85 EENNCCOOUUNNTTEERR II11 F A EATURES OF THE REA",

If he can’t see a target, however, he emerges from the sacred circle to fi nd one. Baba Zelenna’s Tactics Baba Zelenna regularly uses disguise self to appear as a very old female human. A Spot DC 20 check reveals that she is not quite human— her skin has the faintest tinge of green, and the texture of her hair is almost vinelike. Although Baba Zelenna and the witches are engrossed in their ritual, they quickly abandon it. Baba Zelenna uses invisibility when she fi rst hears sounds of a disturbance, then lashes out with her claws at the fi rst PC to come within her reach. Witches’ Tactics The two witches that have fi endish jaws (as you designate) are the only ones willing to wade into melee at the side of Baba Zel- enna. The other four prefer to use ranged attacks.

Matecu Vintners “Pinot Noir” aged 8 years; 350 gp Selymes Cellars “Vintage Merlot” aged 20 years; 3,000 gp Cyrus (see K62) has been scavenging furnishings from empty Selymes Cellars “Barovia Red Mountain” aged 5 years; rooms, as well as equipment from visitors to the castle that 12,000 gp failed to escape. He’s never managed to acquire anything of any particular value; Strahd and Strahd’s saner servants keep those to themselves. If Cyrus is with the PCs when they enter this chamber, a DC 20 Spot check reveals how his eyes light up when he looks at the PCs’ equipment. He says, “If you ever need to store any- thing, this is the room to do it in. A good col- lection always wants to grow!” In fact, he looks forward to add- ing the PCs’ stuff to the room once Strahd gets around to dealing with them. 9955339933772200__CChh0044..iinndddd 111100 77//2266//0066 77::3333::1144 PPMM 111 RAVENLOFT CASTLE CHAPTER 4 K67. GUARD’S HALL Battles have been fought and lost in this large chamber. Darkness, cold as winter sweat, fi lls this chamber. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about this room, their wood crushed and splintered. Dark stains cover the fl oor and walls. Three years ago, a party of adventurers entered Strahd’s domain and made it to this chamber before their fate caught up with them. Here, Strahd, Lucian, and several other servitors massed and fi nally took down the intrud- ers. Their remains are interred in one of the catacombs of K84 (crypt 10). If Cyrus is with the PCs when they enter this chamber, he says: “Oh, now these fellows were tough ones! Came to kill the master of the castle! Strahd had to gather his forces to stomp them here. I think he keeps the skull of their leader as a trophy.”",

Despite its similarity to amorphous creatures like the gibbering mouthers that accompany it, the shapeless spawn is susceptible to critical hits and sneak attacks. DEVELOPMENT The shapeless spawn enjoys its relationship with Strahd and has no wish to see that relationship severed. The creature sees the player characters as a threat to its goals. Whether Strahd is in the room or not, the shapeless form decides that the threat the PCs present to its goals must be eliminated. STRAHD’S TACTICS If Strahd is present with the shapeless spawn, his behavior is completely erratic. He acts as if confused; roll every round to determine his actions unless he was attacked on the pre- vious round. If Strahd is attacked, he attacks the creature that most recently attacked him in the following round. He cannot attack the shapeless spawn, regardless of the result of the dice roll. Strahd remains in his feral form for the entire encounter.

Once the victim is inside, the mouther can use its blood drain ability. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 5 points of damage to the mouther (AC 19). Its body can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, or 8 Tiny creatures. Blood Drain (Ex) A swallowed opponent takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round. This ability does not affect elementals, plants, or creatures that lack a Constitution score. Ground Manipulation (Su) At will, as a standard action on two consecutive rounds, a gibbering mouther can soften the stone in all adjacent squares. Anyone other than the mouther must use a move action to avoid becoming mired in the soft stone (treat as being pinned). 9955339933772200__CChh0044__EEnncc..iinndddd 113399 77//2266//0066 77::5500::1133 PPMM S O ’’ TTEEWWAARRDD SS FFFFIICCEE Encounter Level 10 Use this tactical encounter with the room description on page 98. The player characters enter this area either from the Audi- ence Hall (K25) or the South Tower Stairs (K21). Strahd’s steward, a madman named Lief Lipsiege (L on the map), sits on a stool at a desk covered with scrolls. He is surrounded by three undead spellcasters called deathlocks (D). None of them are hiding, but neither are they immediately and obviously hostile. Read the text below when the PCs open one of the doors, then allow them to decide if they want to try to talk to Lief or simply plunge into combat. If combat is chosen, the PCs might get a surprise round, depending on how they approach the situation. FIRST VIEW",

        "description":  " A fi gure crouches atop a tall stool beside a large desk, scratching a quill across a long parchment. He wears a chain shirt but does not appear to be armed. Three gaunt fi gures stand impassively around the man at the desk, draped in embroidered cloaks. The man looks up absently as the door opens, and then starts in surprise as he sees you. He begins rummaging around on the desk in front of him. As he does, his tongue darts out of the corner of his mouth—long, maggot- white, and slightly forked. After rummaging around his desk for an instant, Lief produces a greatsword and begins swinging it wildly around his head. There is an obvious maniacal gleam in his wide, unblinking eyes. THE MONSTERS The undead creatures are deathlocks, the animated corpses of spellcasters. Skeletally thin and draped in cloaks fringed with magical sigils, deathlocks’ cadaverous eyes sizzle with cursed power. A deathlock prefers to use its spell-like abili- ties from a distance, and often uses its infl ict minor wounds ability to heal itself. ENCOUNTER TACTICS In combat, Lief fi ghts like a raging barbarian, hitting as hard and fast as he can. The deathlocks use cause fear once each, then try to hang back out of melee combat and use 140 their magic missiles. They resort to using their bite attacks only when absolutely no other option remains. If a deathlock is ever adjacent to an unconscious PC, it uses death knell on that target. 0033KK RREETTNNUUOOCCNNEE Lief Lipsiege CR 8 HP 92 ___________________________________________________ Male tainted raver (human) aristocrat 3/fighter 6 CE Medium humanoid Init +1; Senses blindsense 30 ft.; Listen +6, Spot +6 Languages Common, Draconic, Giant AC 15, touch 14, flat-footed 14 HD 9; Fast healing 3 Immune confusion Fort +12, Ref +5, Will +10 Speed 30 ft.

In this state, the raver gains a +4 bonus on its Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to Armor Class (included in the statistics above). An effect that counters rage, such as the calm emotions spell, temporarily suppresses this ability and negates these bonuses and penalties. Unlike a barbarian’s rage, a tainted raver’s perpetual fury does not prevent it from taking actions that require reasoned thought or concentration. A tainted raver can cast spells, use skills, activate magic items, and even act calmly and rationally. Madness (Ex) A tainted raver is irretrievably mad. It uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier and has immunity to confusion and insanity effects. Anyone targeting a tainted raver with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and has its depravity score increased by 1d3 points from that contact. (Ignore this effect if you are not using the taint rules). A tainted raver cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a miracle or wish spell. If restored to sanity, a tainted raver loses this template and all the modifiers it applies. 9955339933772200__CChh0044__EEnncc..iinndddd 114400 77//2266//0066 77::5500::2211 PPMM TALKING TO LIEF Lief is possessed by a murderous insane rage, but it is possible to talk to him.

How this encounter plays out depends on what the PCs did before getting here. If the PCs ring the bell in the belfry (K40), the two cheliceras (marked as C on the map) descend from above to attack them. (See also the “special effect” on the next page). If the Fortunes of Ravenloft reading indicates that Strahd can be found in the treasury (K41), then the encoun- ter begins when the PCs open the secret door into the treasury (S1) and fi nd him there, in his feral form. Strahd then summons the chelicera to his aid. If the PCs do not ring the bell and the Fortunes of Ravenloft reading did not indicate Strahd’s presence in the treasury, there is an encounter here only if Strahd decides to attack. In this case, he fi rst orders the cheliceras to attack. He then emerges in his “werebat” form from out of the bell rafters one round later to join the fray (starting in the square marked S2 on the map). If the PCs come to the treasury to perform a bonding ritual, regardless of any other potential encounters, Strahd attacks them at some point during the process. He makes this attack when they are totally engaged and least expect- ing it, appearing out of the shadows in his feral form to rattle them and then disrupt the ritual. MONSTERS",
