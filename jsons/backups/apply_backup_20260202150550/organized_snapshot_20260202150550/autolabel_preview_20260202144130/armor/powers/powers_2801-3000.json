HOW TO USE THIS BOOK This book’s primary goal is to help you customize your barbarian, druid, or ranger player character. With the ma- terial presented here, you can personalize your character and broaden his or her capabilities. Chapter 1 discusses the advantages of playing a bar- barian, druid, or ranger. Here you’ll find advice on how to take advantage of your character’s class abilities and min- imize any potential weaknesses. Explanations of, advice on, and expansions to topics that are already part of the game, such as choosing favored enemies are also here. Chapter 2 offers special feats, such as Fast Wild Shape and Dragon’s Toughness, with which to enhance your character’s abilities. In addition, there is an extensive dis- cussion of skills, with notes on new and interesting uses of class skills for barbarians, druids, and rangers. Chapter 3 presents items of interest to both spellcast- ing and nonspellcasting characters. Chapter 4 offers advice on how to play alongside animal companions. It also includes statistics for new dire animals as well as for members of a new subtype of animal—legendary animals. Chapter 5 takes your character in exciting new direc- tions with the animal lord, the blighter, the frenzied berserker, and many other prestige classes. Chapter 6 expands the selection of divine spells avail- able at all spell levels. 4 CHAPTER 1: NATURE\u0027S LORE C HAPTER 1: traps.

        "description":  "Doing It Yourself A character who’s at home in the outdoors and has a good working knowledge of plants may be able to collect and prepare the components for an infusion personally rather than paying the local herbalist for them. With a little time and energy, a character with ranks in Profession (herbal- ist) and Wilderness Lore can remove the merchant from the equation and save some money in the process. Collecting Different infusions require different herbs. Not surpris- ingly, the higher the spell level, the more rare and prized is the herb required for an infusion of it. Thus, not only is the herb for a heal infusion different from the one for a cure light wounds infusion, it is also harder to find. Herbs for the highest-level spells may grow only in the re- motest locales, so collection may require long journeys. A character can use Wilderness Lore to forage for an herb while moving at one-half his or her normal over- land movement rate through a forested or other natural area. Make a Wilderness Lore check (DC = 10 + twice the level of the spell to be infused) at the end ot each day spent foraging. Success indicates that the character has found a sufficient quantity of the herb for a single infu- sion of the desired spell; failure means none was found. Casting detect animals or plants grants the character a +2 circumstance bonus on that day’s check. While foraging in this fashion, a character can also forage for sustenance, as detailed in the Wilderness Lore skill description in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook. Gardening Though growing herbs for infusions seems like a good idea, seldom does an adventuring character actually do 32 so. Maintaining an herb garden requires hours of work each day in a single locale, and most adventurers cannot abide this degree of attachment to one place. Still, any CHAPTER 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE character wishing to undertake the challenge of garden- ing may attempt it according to the following rules. Once the character has acquired a sample of the de- sired herb (see Collecting, above), he or she can attempt to cultivate it. A single character can care for a number of herbs equal to twice the number of ranks he or she has acquired in Wilderness Lore. With proper care, an herb garden produces a harvest twice a year. To produce an herb crop, the character must make a Wilderness Lore or Profession (farmer) check for each week of cultivation, plus an additional Wilderness Lore check at harvest time. The DC for the weekly cultivation check is one-half the DC required to find the herb (see Collecting, above). If this check fails by 5 or more, the herb withers and dies. Each time it fails by less than 5, a cumulative –1 penalty is imposed on the final Wilder- ness Lore check for harvesting the crop, if that last check is successful, the herbs harvested are sufficient for a number of infusions equal to one-half the check result. Failure indicates that no usable herbs are produced. Hiring a gardener to perform this task may be a rea- sonable option. A skilled gardener earns 1 gp per day, or about 180 gp per season. (This does not include the cost of acquiring the herb for planting, nor the cost of the land for the garden.) The average gardener can cultivate two herbs per season, each of which produces enough herbs for 1d4 infusions. Preparing Before an herb can be used in an infusion, it must be the item in silver pieces, the preparation is complete. properly prepared. Some herbs must be treated or dried; Failure at any point indicates that the character makes others must be baked, steamed, or doused with a solution no progress that week. Failure by 5 or more means the of oil or seawater. Again, the higher the level of the spell character ruins the raw materials and must begin again to be infused, the more difficult and complex the prepa- with a fresh supply of the herb. ration becomes. Preparing an herb for infusion requires a Profession (herbalist) check. Optional Rule: Benefits of Hard Work To determine how long the preparation takes, first find Taking the time and trouble to collect or grow each herb, the base cost to create the infusion on Table 3—3 and con- prepare it, and infuse it with a spell is hard work.

Making an infusion “from scratch” raises the spell to be infused) representing one week’s worth of its caster level by +1. This increase alters neither the cost work, if the check succeeds, multiply the check result by of creating the infusion nor the difficulty of using it. the DC. A total equal to or greater than the base cost for creation means that the herb is ready to be infused with Optional Rule: Tailored Infusions the desired spell.
