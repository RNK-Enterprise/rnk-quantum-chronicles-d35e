Some creatures have the natural ability to plane shift into this realm, some cast spells that allow them to do so, and some find their way to the Astral Plane through portals and magical mishaps. The table below is suitable for typical travelers, but the Dungeon Master can also use it as a springboard for encounter tables for specific areas by adding new crea- tures or changing the percentages. It is designed for trav- elers physically entering the plane through spells such as plane shift,though there are creatures present that would threaten travelers moving in astral form. On a d% roll of 96–100, characters encounter something on Table 5–3: Astral Encounters. Roll once per hour. ETHEREAL PLANE It is a plane out of phase. It is a place of ghosts and monsters. It is right next to you, and you don’t even see it. The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. Travelers within the Ethereal Plane describe the plane as a collection of swirling mists and colorful fogs. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the Material Plane as though viewing it through distorted and frosted glass. While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Mater- ial Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane. This makes the Ethereal Plane very useful for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and other occasions when it’s handy to move around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the plane has its own inhabi- tants. Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the fog. ETHEREAL TRAITS The Ethereal Plane seems almost a nonplane in that it is tightly wedded to the Material Plane. It can be thought a handful, though large fortress-cities such as Tu’narath of as a fourth physical dimension or a vibration slightly have a fleet, some of which are used for trade. out of tune with the rest of the universe.
