        "description":  "A qorrashi (a kind of frost genie, see Frostburn, page 131) named Jusii (YOO-seyee) has created the sculptures and frost patterns. Because of his artistic temperament, Jusii found life among his almost universally lawful neutral people much too restrictive, so he exiled himself to the glacier, where he spends endless hours sculpting and painting, using small amounts of pure water instead of pigments. From time to time, he even ventures down the mountain and into more civilized areas, where he creates his frost paintings on whatever suitable surfaces he can find (most often windowpanes and frozen ponds). He only does so when cold weather prevails in the areas he visits, however. Jusii doesn\u0027t care for even moderate temperatures, and his art requires freezing temperatures or lower.",
