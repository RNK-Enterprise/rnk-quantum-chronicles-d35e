        "description":  "AL NE; 25,000 gp limit; Assets 13,101,250 gp; Population 10,481; Mixed (65% human, 25% goblinoid, 8% half-orc, 2% other). Sutulak was once a simple meeting point between orc and human lands where unscrupulous members of both communities could trade in stolen goods, livestock, and—on occasion—captives. Only after word got out about the place, and corrupt nobles from elsewhere began to arrive in search of slave labor, did the locals realize the potential of their situation. Sutulak grew swiftly into a functional if unattractive city. Today, its buildings are sturdier, its roads wider, and its walls higher, but it’s no less ugly or squalid than before. Sutulak is ruled by a council of its richest citizens— that is, the most powerful slave-traders. An enormous portion of the population consists of slaves and those who guard them, giving the entire city an atmosphere of misery. Sutulak has a higher gp limit than most cities its size due to the constant inﬂ  ux of slavers. At any given time it might contain more than 2,000 travelers, both buyers and sellers, in addition to its resident population. ARCHITECTURE As with many other aspects of the city, Sutulak’s archi-tecture is sharply divided along class lines. The stone houses and ofﬁ  ces of the powerful are bizarre hybrids of military and opulent styles. They feature strong doors, narrow windows, and high gates to protect against rivals’ forces, assassination attempts, and the constant threat of uprising. Yet they might also display ornate statues or colorful dyes, the better to showcase the wealth of 620_95386_Ch1.indd   16620_95386_Ch1.indd   16 8/21/06   4:44:58 PM8/21/06   4:44:58 PM17CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY the owners. Most of the city’s other structures are wooden and simple, whether they serve as homes for the city’s poor or as shops, taverns, and slave stables. The citizens of Sutulak prefer swift and cheap to difﬁ  cult and expensive. The city government devotes some attention to inﬂ uencing the ﬁ  rst impressions of visitors. Although Sutulak’s clients arrive simply to do business and are unimpressed with shows of wealth, they do appreciate efﬁ ciency. Thus, the larger and cleaner buildings are clus- tered along the main avenues, so that visitors encounter them before seeing anything else.LAYOUT Sutulak, like other slaver cities, resembles a military compound in terms of general layout. The streets are almost all unpaved, other than the few leading to the slave markets. Those main avenues are wide, if not well kept, to allow carts to carry slaves to and from the markets. Smaller streets are winding and confusing, to slow the escape of any slaves who manage to ﬂ  ee. Soldiers stand at all major intersections, and the city’s various districts are walled off from each other. Guarded gates ensure that escaped slaves must bypass multiple obstacles to win freedom. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   17620_95386_Ch1.indd   17 8/21/06   4:45:11 PM8/21/06   4:45:11 PM18 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY A stone defensive wall rings the city, but it is unlike most others. Wooden spikes and embedded broken glass protrude from both sides, and portcullises defend the inside and outside of the heavy wooden doors. Sutulak’s wall is designed to enable defenders to ﬁ  ght off invaders from outside or rebelling slaves from within. Sutulak Map Key The keyed locations on the Sutulak map indicate various districts of the city. For a general discussion of these features, see City Districts beginning on page 34. 1.

Slave quarter PERSONA Sutulak is crowded, dirty, and miserable, and its citi-zens are much the same. The large slave population is wretched but transient, and most of the citizens are poor. Artisans and shopkeepers support the city’s only thriving industry by manufacturing and selling merchandise suited to the needs of slave traders, such as tools, shackles, and simple clothing. Foreign mer- chants do not come here for other kinds of goods, and thus a shop that deals in furniture or tailored clothing ( f or instance ) is only as successful as local demand allows it to be. The constant parade of newly captured slaves, crying in pain and despair, has deadened of the souls of Sutulak’s common people. They go through the motions of daily existence but care little about anything else. In sharp contrast are the few successful slave trad-ers who make their homes in the city. They dwell in fancy buildings, dress in ornate and colorful clothes, and send for delicacies and luxuries from other cities. Like the general population, these people are also i n u r e d  t o  s u f f e r i n g ,  b u t  t h e y  r e v e a l  t h e i r  s o u l l e s s -ness through greed and cruelty rather than through general ennui. Given such a climate of poverty and misery, it is only natural that crime is rampant in Sutulak. The government deals with criminals as might be expected: It sells them to the slavers .

Use it to repair the wax seals used on official messages to prove that they have never been opened; to fix locks and broken windows, hiding evidence of an escape or break-in; to repair torn clothes, hiding evidence of wounds until a body is closely searched; to reattach pages of a book that were stolen for copying; and many similar uses that can hide your trail as effectively as much more potent magics. 2: Rulers dislike it when adventurers become more popular than they are. Public acclaim is nice, but watch for backlash from above. 3: Once blood has been shed or public property destroyed, the city watch doesn’t much care who started it. The magis-trate might listen to your tale of self-defense, but the watch is going to beat heads and clasp manacles first and ask ques- tions later. 4: Nobody gets (or stays) rich by paying more than they have to for services. If a contract seems too high, it doesn’t mean you got lucky—it means you’re probably about to be used or cheated in some fashion. 5: One good, hot meal, when offered to the right person, can buy you as much good will—and therefore as much information and cooperation—as any monster you might slay or any other favor you might perform on that person’s behalf. 620_95386_Ch2.indd   64620_95386_Ch2.indd   64 8/22/06   9:14:23 AM8/22/06   9:14:23 AM65CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERNEW SPELLS The city has its own hazards to deal with, its own hurdles to work around, and its own mystical ﬂ  ow.

CRIMINAL GUILDS These organizations are illegal and highly secretive, except in particularly corrupt cities. They exist for one purpose: to protect their members from the law, the citizenry, and rival criminals. A criminal guild offers its members somewhere to train, compare notes, learn of opportunities, fence stolen goods, or simply lie low for a time. It is particularly valuable as a means of ﬁ nding employment, since those who require an illicit service often approach the guild (which in turn farms the job out to a speciﬁ  c member).

While many gladiators are slaves, free ﬁ  ghters also participate in public matches. A gladiatorial stable is a small guild, usually consisting of a number of gladiators, support staff such as healers and trainers, and an owner or man-ager. Some arenas do not accept free ﬁ  ghters who do not b e l o n g  t o  an  e s t a b li s h e d  s t a b l e .  E v e n  if  th e y  d o ,  s t a b l e  managers often have the contacts and clout to arrange better and more proﬁ  table ﬁ  ghts. A reputable gladiato- rial stable provides free healing to its members (at least for injuries sustained in the arena), arranges matches between foes, and offers to invest a gladiator’s proﬁ  ts in other enterprises if the gladiator so chooses. It can also provide most nonmagical equipment a gladiator might request, though he can usually use such items only in the arena, not on outside adventures. Unlike other guilds, gladiatorial stables do not require monthly dues. They make their profits on fees from the gladiators’ matches (and from betting on the side, of course).

In a campaign that covers multiple settings, it hardly matters if some characters are more effective in one, and others in another; in fact, such myriad skills are all but essential. In a city-focused campaign, however, a traditional druid or ranger might find her abilities less useful than those of classes such as the rogue or the bard. Of course, you can gear these classes toward adventuring in the city from the start. The urban barbarian is no wild warrior from a distant land, but a rage-driven streetfighter from the worst neighborhoods. The urban druid still seeks to manipulate the natural world while revering its powers, but she may be more interested in the ebb and flow of the city -- and the living things within -- than in the surrounding woods or distant fields. Presented here are urban-oriented alternate class features for the barbarian, druid, ranger, scout (Complete Adventurer), and spirit shaman (Complete Divine) classes. Not all city-dwelling members of these classes possess these features, but the options exist for those who want them. In addition, while the paladin is hardly a wilderness-oriented class, her summoned mount is not appropriate for all city-focused campaigns, so she gains a few alternate class features as well. Several class features presented here reference feats and mechanics found in Cityscape. City-Shape The ability to transform into an animal is the hallmark of the druid, so much so that even many urban druids choose to retain it. Some, however, prefer the ability to blend and maneuver within the streets of the city, sacrificing size for a wider range of forms.",

When actually resolving the opposed roll, however, substitute your caster level for your base attack bonus and either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice) for your Strength. Because the attack is made at a distance, it does not draw an attack of opportunity that such an attack would draw under normal circumstances, nor can your foe attempt to perform the same maneuver on you in turn, even if such is normally allowed. Cityscape, Part 3 Cityscape, Part 3 Urban Tools By Ari Marmell Cityscape presents a variety of new feats, spells, and warlock invocations that were developed in an urban environment or that you can use in a city-based setting. While these are the most prevalent of new tools and tricks for the urban adventurer, however, they are far from the only ones. For those who do not practice such esoteric arts, not only magic items, but also alchemical and entirely mundane tools, exist to enhance the abilities of the city explorer. Several of the abilities and items herein reference mechanics from Cityscape . For Tools of the Trade The city poses unique challenges, and many a creative craftsman or skilled wizard has risen to meet those challenges. Presented here are a number of items particularly suited to urban adventuring. Alchemical Items Alchemical items often seem like magic to the ignorant, though they are less potent than true magic.

The educa - tion of the dwarf people is considered a sacred duty, and those who are considered knowledgeable in dwarf his - tory and legend—and thought to possess above-average common sense—are often called upon to take up the respected role of teacher in the community. While other cultures might see this as a job for young girls or old men, the dwarves see an ollam as a protector of their cherished culture. No one in the dwarf community takes that position lightly. An ollam is granted a special position in the temple hierarchy—Moradin gives her spells that allow her not only to delve into the secrets of the universe but also to heal and keep an eye on her charges. While most ollams are clerics or bards, individuals of other classes are welcomed, as long as they possess the knowledge needed to teach the children properly. NPC ollams are equally likely to be safely ensconced in the heart of a dwarf community, passing on the accumulated lore of their people, or wandering the lands, sharing their knowl - edge with dwarves and nondwarves alike. If there’s something going on in a dwarf city, you can count on the ollams knowing about it ﬁrst. They’re uncommonly well connected with each clan and stratum of dwarf society.",

        "description":  "Such an organization exists solely to help its individual members spread hatred, destruction, and mayhem. A murder cult is one example of a chaotic evil organization.STEP 3: SIZE Determine how large the organization is and where it is based. If you haven’t already chosen a size based on your campaign needs, roll on Table 6–3: Organization Size. The size (minor, medium, or major) will help you determine the organization’s member population. Table 6–3: Organization Size d% Organization Size 01–40 Minor1 41–90 Medium2 91–100 Major 1 Minor organizations don’t exist in thorps or hamlets. 2 Medium organizations don’t exist in thorps. STEP 4: POPULATION AND RESOURCES After determining the relative size of your organization, use the appropriate column on Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size to determine its population. If you’ve already decided on the membership’s size and population, you can skip this step. Just like a community, every organization has a gold piece limit to its resources based on its size and popula - tion. The gold piece limit is an indicator of the maximum amount of money the organization can afford to spend in any given week, on any one item, or in pursuit of any given objective. The gold piece limit noted in Table 6–4 is for a medium organization. A minor organization has a gold piece limit of one-half the indicated value, while a major organization has a gold piece limit of twice the indicated value. To determine the amount of ready cash in an organiza - tion, or the total value of any given item of equipment for sale at any given time, multiply half the gp limit by 1/10 of the organization’s membership.STEP 5: DEMOGRAPHICS To effectively use an organization in play, you must know its composition. The following guidelines allow you to determine the most common classes and races repre - sented and the levels of the various members belonging to the group, from the leader down to the lowest-ranking associates. Class Demographics The mix of classes represented in any given organization depends on whether that group is exclusive (limiting its membership almost wholly to a single occupation), mixed (with a dominant class and a small representation of other classes), or integrated (including members from a wide variety of classes). Table 6–5: Class Mix Exclusive Primary class 96% Secondary class 2% Tertiary class 1% Other classes 1% Mixed Primary class 79% Secondary class 9% Tertiary class 5% Tertiary class 3% Tertiary class 2% Other classes 2%Integrated Primary class 37% Secondary class 20% Tertiary class 18% Tertiary class 10% Tertiary class 7% Tertiary class 5% Other classes 3% You should decide on a primary class based on the type, alignment, and location of your organization. For instance, most trade-based organizations count experts as their primary class, while religious organizations have adepts, clerics, and other divine spellcasters in the majority. Most thieves guilds are mixed, with a majority of rogues but a fair number of experts, warriors, ﬁghters, bards, and other characters. A typical wizard academy might be exclusive (limiting its membership almost entirely to pure wizards) or mixed (with sorcerers and other arcane casters joining the assemblage). An adventur - ers guild is likely to be highly integrated, with members of all walks of life. Don’t forget to include one or more NPC classes in your demographics, particularly warriors and experts.Highest-Level Members Use Table 6–6 and Table 6–7 to determine the highest- level character in the primary class of your organization. Roll the dice indicated for the class that you have deter - mined is primary, and apply the modiﬁer based on the size of the community found in Table 6–9. For secondary, tertiary, and other classes, use Table 6–8 to determine the highest-level character based on the town size. For instance, in a small city, the highest-level character of the organization’s secondary class will be one-half the result derived from Table 6–6 or 6–7, while the highest-level character of the organization’s tertiary classes will be one-fourth the normal result. Characters of other classes will be 1st level. Table 6–6: Highest-Level Members (PC Classes) PC Class Character Level (Primary Class) Barbarian 1d4 + community modifier Bard 1d6 + community modifier Cleric 1d6 + community modifier Druid 1d6 + community modifier Fighter 1d8 + community modifier Monk 1d4 + community modifier Paladin 1d3 + community modifier Ranger 1d3 + community modifier Rogue 1d8 + community modifier Sorcerer 1d4 + community modifier Wizard 1d4 + community modifier Table 6–7: Highest-Level Members (NPC Classes) NPC Class Character Level (Primary Class)Adept 1d6 + community modifier Aristocrat 1d4 + community modifierCommoner 4d4 + community modifierExpert 3d4 + community modifier Warrior 2d4 + community modifier In larger communities, there is a chance that the highest-level character in the secondary class will use the normal result from Table 6–6 or 6–7, and a chance that the highest-level character in the tertiary class will be determined just as for the secondary class. The high - est-level character in all other classes will be half the result derived for the tertiary class. Round fractional results down, but treat any result of less than 1st level as 1st level. In any organization, there is a 5% chance that a single member who doesn’t belong to the group’s primary, secondary, or tertiary classes will have a level equal to (or higher than) the highest-level character in your organization’s primary class. This character might repre - sent a “wild card” in the organization, a unique member, or simply a ﬁsh out of water.Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size Community Community  Organization Membership1 GP Size Population Minor Medium Major Limit2 Thorp 20–80 n/a n/a 1–2 20 gp Hamlet 81–400 n/a 1–2 3–5 50 gp Village 401–900 1–2 3–5 6–10 100 gp Small town 901–2,000 3–5 6–10 11–25 400 gp Large town 2,001–5,000 6–10 11–25 26–60 1,500 gp Small city 5,001–12,000 11–25 26–60 61–125 7,500 gp Large city 12,001–25,000 26–60 61–125 126–250 20,000 gp Metropolis 25,001+ 61–125 126–250 251+ 50,000 gp 1  These numbers can be used to represent how many members exist in a given community; they need not represent the total number of members in the organization. 2  Halve the indicated value for minor organizations, and double it for major organizations.186 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 187CHAPTER 6",

Table 6–6: Highest-Level Members (PC Classes) PC Class Character Level (Primary Class) Barbarian 1d4 + community modifier Bard 1d6 + community modifier Cleric 1d6 + community modifier Druid 1d6 + community modifier Fighter 1d8 + community modifier Monk 1d4 + community modifier Paladin 1d3 + community modifier Ranger 1d3 + community modifier Rogue 1d8 + community modifier Sorcerer 1d4 + community modifier Wizard 1d4 + community modifier Table 6–7: Highest-Level Members (NPC Classes) NPC Class Character Level (Primary Class)Adept 1d6 + community modifier Aristocrat 1d4 + community modifierCommoner 4d4 + community modifierExpert 3d4 + community modifier Warrior 2d4 + community modifier In larger communities, there is a chance that the highest-level character in the secondary class will use the normal result from Table 6–6 or 6–7, and a chance that the highest-level character in the tertiary class will be determined just as for the secondary class. The high - est-level character in all other classes will be half the result derived for the tertiary class. Round fractional results down, but treat any result of less than 1st level as 1st level. In any organization, there is a 5% chance that a single member who doesn’t belong to the group’s primary, secondary, or tertiary classes will have a level equal to (or higher than) the highest-level character in your organization’s primary class. This character might repre - sent a “wild card” in the organization, a unique member, or simply a ﬁsh out of water.Table 6–4: Membership by Community Size Community Community  Organization Membership1 GP Size Population Minor Medium Major Limit2 Thorp 20–80 n/a n/a 1–2 20 gp Hamlet 81–400 n/a 1–2 3–5 50 gp Village 401–900 1–2 3–5 6–10 100 gp Small town 901–2,000 3–5 6–10 11–25 400 gp Large town 2,001–5,000 6–10 11–25 26–60 1,500 gp Small city 5,001–12,000 11–25 26–60 61–125 7,500 gp Large city 12,001–25,000 26–60 61–125 126–250 20,000 gp Metropolis 25,001+ 61–125 126–250 251+ 50,000 gp 1  These numbers can be used to represent how many members exist in a given community; they need not represent the total number of members in the organization. 2  Halve the indicated value for minor organizations, and double it for major organizations.188 CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS 189CHAPTER 6 ORGANIZATIONS Table 6–9: Community Modifiers Community Community Size Modifier Thorp –3* Hamlet –2* Village –1 Small town +0 Large town +3 Small city +6 Large city +9 Metropolis +12 * A thorp or a hamlet has a 5% chance to add +10 to the modifier of a ranger or druid level. Total Characters of Each Class Use the following method to determine the levels of all the characters in an organization of any given class. If the highest-level character of a given class indicated is 4th level or above, assume that there is one additional character of that class of half that level. If this process results in a character who is 4th level or higher, assume that there are two characters of half that character’s level. Continue until the number of 2nd- or 3rd-level charac - ters is generated. Do not generate 1st-level members in this manner. After you have determined the number of 2nd- and 3rd-level characters of each class, divide the remaining population so that it matches the class demographics of the organization. For instance, if 37% of an organization are rogues, then 37% of the leftover membership are 1st-level rogues. Repeat for each class present in the organization. You can also round out any organization with a few characters of classes not represented in the organization’s typical mix. For instance, even if your thieves guild doesn’t have a listing for wizards, you can still add one to the membership. Don’t forget to include multiclass or prestige-class characters as appropriate. Your final membership numbers—particularly the 1st-level characters of PC classes—might not match up well with the expected quantity of that class in the community, as indicated in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide . Don’t worry too much about this. That book’s method of determining the number of characters with PC class levels might be too con - servative for your campaign, particularly if you have many cities and metropolises (which are likely to have large, powerful organizations). If you need a reason for this discrepancy, consider the possibility that the organization has drawn a great number of members from outlying towns and villages. Also, remember that many low-level characters might belong to more than one organization.Leader of the Organization The leader of an organization is usually the highest-level character of the primary class. Roll on Table 6–10: Organization Leader or select an appropriate character to lead the group. Table 6–10: Organization Leader d% Leader 01–70 Highest-level character of primary class71–85 Second-highest-level character of primary class86–95 Highest-level character (regardless of class) 96–100 Other (DM’s choice) Racial Demographics Most organizations mirror the local racial mix, though exceptions are common. Use Table 6–11: Racial Demo - graphics, or select an appropriate racial mix for your organization. Table 6–11: Racial Demographics d% Demographics 01–60 Same as community1 61–90 More isolated than community2 91–100 More integrated than community3 1  See the Racial Mix of Communities table, page 139 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. 2  Use the racial mix one step toward isolated. If the community already uses the isolated racial mix, treat as isolated. 3  Use the racial mix one step toward integrated. If the community already uses the integrated racial mix, treat as integrated. STEP 6: FLESH OUT THE DETAILS At this point, all that’s left is to breathe life into the framework you’ve created. Provide the organization with a name, turn your NPCs into full-ﬂedged characters (with personalities and backgrounds as appropriate), and link the organization to your campaign history. Now’s the time to determine other crucial details about the group you’ve created. Is it a secretive organization whose existence is known only to its members? Even a craft guild might pride itself on secrecy and mystery. How hard or easy is it to join the group? What kind of insignias, code words, or secret handshakes does the group use? Does the group enjoy support (whether public or private) from local authorities, or is it a renegade assembly? Is the organization respected by the populace, or are its members social pariahs? These and other details are what will transform your organization from a mere collection of numbers into a full-ﬂedged part of your campaign.APPENDIX: THE EPIC ADVENTURER The Player’s Handbook  establishes 20th level as the limit of a character’s power and experience. The Dungeon Master’s Guide , however, provides rules for going beyond that limit to 21st level and higher. Such characters are called epic-level characters and use slightly modiﬁed rules to govern their interactions. This section addresses some issues relevant to epic skill-using characters, from becoming an epic character, to advancing to epic levels in prestige classes, to new epic feats. BECOMING AN EPIC-LEVEL ADVENTURER The passage from everyday hero to epic hero isn’t a given fact of life in all games. Every DM has his or her own opinions about how (or if) to incorporate epic-level char - acters into the campaign. Assuming that your campaign offers characters the opportunity to achieve 21st level, this section provides some advice for the player and DM of a rogue, ranger, bard, or similar character to use when approaching that point. More than any other type of character, great adventur - ers of lore are identiﬁed with daring tasks of guile, skill, and sheer chutzpah. Jason led a band of mythic heroes on a great quest for the golden ﬂeece. Orpheus braved the horrors of the underworld with only his musical talent to rescue his beloved Eurydice. The legendary hunter Orion claimed he could kill any animal in the world. Loki stole anything he could get his hands on, including the Golden Apples of Idun and the Necklace of Brisingamen. In order to reach 21st level, an adventurer might have to accomplish a task of such daring that even the gods take notice of his skill. Another mark of a legendary skilled character is his talent in a particular area of expertise. While anyone with 23 ranks in a single skill might claim to be the best in the world, epic contests involving such skills are the only way of proving such a claim. Whether such a contest takes the form of a series of ever more difﬁcult tasks (such as a set of ﬁendishly trapped locks that must be opened safely) or a single challenge of titanic proportions (such as swimming across an ocean), the contest must be truly memorable in its scope and difﬁculty. You can, of course, use similar goals or quests even for nonepic characters.

        "description":  "REARING A DRAGON Being an adoptive parent to a dragon is no easy task. Even good-aligned dragons have a sense of superiority and an innate yearning for freedom. Most dragons instinctively deferto older dragons of the same kind, but they tend to regard other creatures with some disdain. Older and wiser dragons eventually learn to respect non- dragons for their abilities and accomplishments, but a newly hatched wyrmling tends to regard a nondragon foster parent as a captor—or at best as a well-meaning fool. Still, it is possiblefor a nondragon character to forge a bond with a newly hatched wyrmling. Accomplishing this requires the use of Diplomacy or Intimidate as well as (eventually) the Handle Animal skill. A character seeking to rear a newly hatched wyrmling must begin with a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to persuade the dragon to accept the character’s guidance; 5 or more ranks of Knowledge (arcana) gives the character a +2 bonus on thecheck. The character’s Diplomacy or Intimidate check is opposed by a Sense Motive check by the dragon. The dragon has a +15 racial bonus on its check. Certain other conditions,such as those mentioned on the table below, can further modify the wyrmling’s Sense Motive check. Condition ModifierCharacter tended the dragon’s egg while –2 it was incubating Character was present at the dragon’s hatching –5 Each component of dragon’s alignment –5 in common with the character’s1 1 Alignment components are chaos, evil, good, law, and neutral. This opposed check is rolled secretly by the DM, so that theplayer of the character does not immediately know the resultof the check. If the wyrmling wins the opposed check, it regards the character as a captor and attempts to gain its free-dom any way it can. (Most dragons, even newly hatched wyrm- lings, are smart enough to forego an immediate attack on a more powerful being, and will wait for the right opportunity toescape.) No attempt by this character to rear this dragon can succeed. This opposed check cannot be retried. If the character wins this opposed check, he or she can attempt to rear the dragon. The process takes 5 years, but once the rear- ing period begins, the character need only devote one day a week to the dragon’s training. Throughout the rearing period, however,the dragon must be fed and housed at a cost of 10 gp per day. When the rearing period has run its course, the character attempts a Handle Animal check (DC 20 + the dragon’s Hit Dice at the very young stage). Only one check is made, rolledsecretly by the DM. A failed check cannot be retried. If the char- acter’s Handle Animal check fails, the dragon is not success- fully reared and seeks to leave, as noted above. If the checksucceeds, the character can begin to train the dragon to perform tasks (the most common of which is serving as a mount; see Dragons as Mounts, page 136, and the HandleAnimal skill, page 74 of the Player’s Handbook ). For many characters, the ultimate purpose of rearing a dragon is to make it available to the character as a cohort. Torear a dragon for this reason, the character must have takenthe Leadership feat (see page 106 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ) by the time the rearing period expires, and must have a sufficiently high Leadership score to attract the dragon as acohort at that time (using the dragon’s Hit Dice at the very young stage as its cohort level). Also, the dragon’s alignment must not be opposed to the character’s alignment on eitherthe law-vs.-chaos or good-vs.-evil axis (for example, a lawful good character cannot attempt to rear a chaotic evil wyrmling). For more information, see Dragons as Cohorts, page 138. pqqqqrspqqqqrs14 CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS undergoes little obvious physical change. By this stage of life, a dragon is truly a force to be reckoned with—and it knows it. Mature adults display a degree of self-confidence that younger dragons lack. Mature adults seldom seek out dangerjust to prove themselves (except, perhaps, against other drag-ons). Instead, they act with purpose and confidence, oftenlaunching schemes that take years to complete. Because of a mature adult’s power, wealth, and age, it seldom remains unnoticed in the larger world. Its name becomesknown, at least among other dragons, and it often becomes thetarget of rival dragons or adventurers. One of a mature adult’sfirst orders of business is to review and improve the defensesin its lair. Often, the dragon relocates as a matter of prudence.The dragon never chooses its new lair hastily, and usuallyincludes in its plans some scheme to secure more treasure.Bards’ tales of dragons destroying kingdoms and seizing theirtreasuries often have their roots in true accounts of what hap-pens when a mature adult dragon is on the move. OLD (AGE 401-600 YEARS) By the time most dragons reach this age, their physicalgrowth stops, though they become even more hardy, andtheir minds and magical powers continue to expand withthe passing centuries. Old dragons usually begin to show some outward signs of aging: Their scales begin to chip and crack at the edges andalso to darken and lose their luster (though some metallicdragons actually take on a burnished appearance), and theirises in their eyes begin to fade, so that their eyes begin toresemble featureless orbs. Most old dragons continue to hone the patient cunning they began to develop as mature adults. Though quick todefend what they regard as their own, they seldom rush intoanything, preferring instead to plumb the possibilities inany situation before acting. VERY OLD (AGE 601-800 YEARS) After passing the six-century mark, a dragon becomes evenmore resistant to physical punishment. It begins master-ing potent spells and magical abilities. This is the last stageof life in which female dragons remain fertile, and mostfemales attempt to raise at least two clutches of eggs beforetheir reproductive period runs out.ANCIENT (AGE 801-1,000 YEARS) By this stage, female dragons have reached the end of theirreproductive years. Many females compensate by mentor-ing younger dragons of the species, as do many males.Ancient dragons have little to fear from much younger drag-ons that have not yet reached adulthood, and they havemuch wisdom and experience to pass on. Most dragons at this age have minds to match the best and brightest humans, and they can tap into vast stores ofknowledge, both practical and esoteric. WYRM (AGE 1,001-1,200 YEARS) Surviving for more than a thousand years is a grand accom-plishment, even for dragons, and this stage is a great mile stone in dragon life. Even among rival dragons, a wyrm com-mands at least grudging respect. Male dragons at this stageare reaching the end of their reproductive years, but theirexalted status among dragons practically guarantees themmates. Younger females often establish territories adjacentto a male wyrm for mating, for protection, and to make iteasy for the offspring to gain the wyrm as a mentor. GREAT WYRM (AGE 1,201+ YEARS) When a dragon passes the twelve-century mark, its mentaland physical development is finally at an end, and the dragonis at the peak of its physical, mental, and magical powers. THE TWILIGHT AND DEATH Exactly how long a dragon can live after reaching the greatwyrm stage is a matter of some debate (some scholars con-tend that a dragon lives forever). Unfortunately, dragonsthemselves are little help in this matter. They keep no birthrecords and are apt to exaggerate their ages. The half-elf sages Guillaume and Cirjon de Cheirdon made a study of dragon ages by carefully noting when cer-tain famous (and infamous) dragons reached their wyrm cel-ebrations and then tracking their ages from there. Somelater scholars suspect that Guillaume and Cirjon were silverdragons using half-elf guise, and that the speculations theypublished were in fact field notes. In any case, the pair even-tually vanished, and their final resting places are not known.Perhaps they died in a dragon attack, or perhaps they arewith us still, in other guises.",

        "description":  "DRAGON GRAVEYARDS A dragon graveyard presents a macabre landscape of blasted earth littered with ossified dragon bones and fresher dragon remains. Every dragon graveyard has at least one ghostly guardian, charged with protecting the place. The graveyard’s guardian is exactly like a ghostly dragon (see page 161) of a great wyrmdragon, usually a gold dragon or other dragon of lawful align- ment. The guardian exists only to guard the graveyard, not to recover a lost hoard. The guardian cannot be put to rest byoffering it treasure. If it is defeated in combat, the guardian re- forms in 1 day. Other ghostly dragons might be present also. These addi- tional spirits are normal ghostly dragons. Supernatural hazards abound in a dragon graveyard. Periodic storms of elemental energy rage through area. These storms are similar to fire storm spells cast by 20th-level charac- ters (Reflex DC 23 half), except that they can be composed of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, and they cover the whole grave- yard. They typically strike every 1d4 hours, but the frequencycan vary widely. Dragon graveyards also contain areas in which the fabric of the cosmos is weakened. These unstable areas can be anywherefrom 5 feet to 50 feet across. Every 1d4 hours, such an area is equally likely to expel a horde of elementals (treat as an elemen- tal swarm spell cast by a 20th-level character) or draw everything within the unstable area into a vortex leading to an elementalplane. This vortex lasts for 1d4 minutes. Creatures that touch or enter the unstable area during the period of the disturbance are whisked to an elemental plane. A weak spot always has a lingering aura of conjuration magic (aura strength is overwhelming when it is active). A dragon graveyard also has an ever-changing population of dragon skeletons and dragon zombies (see pages 192 and 197) that have become animated by the supernaturalforces in the graveyard. These creatures attack any living creature they meet, except for dragons that have come tothe graveyard to die. The legends about treasure in dragon graveyards are true. A dragon graveyard typically contains triple standard treasure forthe guardian’s Challenge Rating. Though ghostly dragons normally do not have any treasure, a dragon graveyard accu- mulates bits and pieces of treasure that departing dragonshave left behind and equipment from would-be looters whoweren’t up to the challenge.",

Fashioned by the greatest elven artists of the modern age, no two thespian\u0027s masks are alike. A thespian\u0027s mask is carved from the finest ivory and then painted to resemble the face of a humanoid creature. Depending on the whim of the artisan creating it, a thespian\u0027s mask might, for example, bear a fearsome orc warrior\u0027s visage, the fair skin of an elven maiden, or the face of an old human sage. When worn, the mask merges with its owner\u0027s face, changing his features to match those of the humanoid creature depicted upon it. The change affects the wearer as the spell disguise self, but it only changes the wearer\u0027s appearance to match that of the face the mask was crafted to depict.
