When they reach the Lower Planes, the conflict begins in earnest, with the inhabi- tants attacking the invaders from Regulus every step of the way. When the much-reduced force returns to Mechanus, the few remaining troops march straight to their superiors to report. What they say in this meeting is the subject of much speculation: Some claim that they report on the progress of the modron invasion; others insist that they merely describe the state of the planes. Granted, this seems a difficult way to gather knowledge, but perhaps the modron mind sees some particular logic about it. Whatever the case, the report is inexplicable to everyone except modrons. Over the centuries, the inhabitants of the other planes have grown accustomed to the March. Previous Marches are well documented, and an adventurous few have roughed out some of the probable routes for upcoming ones. 5 THE MODRON Anyone who watches the Orrery tick and whir for at least 1 hour can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check CATHEDRAL (DC 30) to discover that the device is actually a working Deep in the heart of Regulus, there stands a tower model of the planes, incredibly detailed and infinitely that appears to defy all the laws of mechanics.
