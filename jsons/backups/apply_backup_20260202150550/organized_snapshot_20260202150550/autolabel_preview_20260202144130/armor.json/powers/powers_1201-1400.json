By playing their failures for laughs, outliers postpone confrontations over their antics. Most people respond to slapstick humor because they’re pleased to only be observ- ers of the mayhem. Few people don’t enjoy seeing someone in a worse spot than they are in, especially if the person in trouble brought it on himself. The mood will sour if the outlier’s goofball decisions lead to an outcome in which the party suffers a signifi cant loss, such as a humiliating defeat in a climactic encounter or the death of another player’s character. Brilliant planners are particu- larly likely to lose their cool in the face of deliberate failure. Dramatists dislike outliers because they can’t fi nd a good in-character reason to trust them. Head off potential confrontations by supplying encounters, preferably early in each session, that give an outlier chances to amusingly sabotage his own character. Create scenes in which the PC can get captured, caught in traps, outsmarted by townsfolk, dumped in the mud, or other- wise suffer comic humiliation. Design these encounters so that the outlier’s antics can’t bring catastrophe down on the rest of the party. Even better, devise encounters in which the class clown’s comeuppance benefits other PCs—preferably those least amused by them. The problem with being an eccentric is that doing so becomes tedious when everyone around you acts likewise. If your entire group consists of oddballs, you might need to run a completely silly minicampaign to get it out of your players’ systems. However, a profusion of oddballs in your game might point to a style imbalance on your part. If the players fi nd success in your campaign impossibly diffi cult, they might fall back on eccentricity as a coping mechanism.

If they have had more fun in past campaigns or with another DM, get them to recount their positive experiences there. No matter how constructive it might be, criticism is tough to give and hard to take. By keeping the discussion specifi c but indirect, you can zero in on your players’ true desires without recrimination or hurt feelings. MEDIATION Any discussion involving the forma- tion of a plan of action will include differences of opinion between players. When different opinions begin to result in hostility between players, you need to step in, calm flaring tempers, and mediate your way to a happy solution. The best way to deal with disputes between players is to head them off before they start. Con- fl icts often arise if players use the game to play out real-world grievances with one another. This sort of confl ict, in which sarcastic comments lead to genu- ine insults and then to a sudden death duel between PCs, tends to occur when players get cranky, bored, or frustrated. By following the techniques in this chapter—keeping up the pace, maintaining focus, balancing player tastes, and calling breaks when the group tires—you should be able to keep these erup- tions to a minimum. If you remember to step in and guide discussions as they begin to founder, you can put emotional distance between the two disputing players. In a detached way, list the pros and cons of each player’s approach. Let them use you as a neutral sounding board as they make their arguments. In most cases, doing so defuses the tension enough to prevent hard feelings. PC-against-PC conflict arising from personal hard feelings between players should always be headed off. These fi ghts lead to even more hard feelings if a PC is seriously hurt or killed, and these confl icts disrupt the fi ctional illusion of the game when characters fi ght for no good reason.

LINKING A PUBLISHED ADVENTURE When you add a published adventure to your ongoing story, you need to consider two important questions: how USING PUBLISHED to connect your current campaign thread, if any, to this ADVENTURES inserted adventure, and how to extract the characters A lot of Dungeon Masters only use adventures they create for from it and divert them back to the main campaign when their own campaigns.

Forcing the PCs to split up adds a whole new level of tension. While rescuing NPCs, the group’s speed is reduced to that of the slowest NPC (unless the characters opt to leave someone behind). Assuming a nearly panicked group not in peak physical condition, this probably lowers the entire group’s speed to 20 feet. Unconscious NPCs might need to be carried. Assume a character can carry one creature one size cat- egory larger than he is, two creatures of his size category, and four creatures one or more size categories smaller than he is. Other Options Your dungeon need not fl ood with water. Consider fl ooding it with lava if it’s near a volcano or a seismically active region, sand if it’s in a desert, or toxic gas anywhere. Lava deals damage as described on page 304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, sand slows creatures and presents the same drowning risks as water, and toxic gas might act as a poison (dealing ability damage) or be fl ammable. ICE BRIDGE An ice bridge is a good example of a hazardous location, since it connects two relatively close but otherwise inaccessible locations, whether it’s the opposite shores of a partially frozen river, the walls of facing cliffs, or the tops of two frozen structures. The ice bridge depicted in the illustration is a span that bridges a crevasse in the high mountains. Locations such as these make great settings for encounters, since adventurers can be funneled toward them with relative ease. Even PCs with good Jump modifi ers or the ability to fl y might be forced to seek out a bridge to cross a chasm, especially if the wind is strong or they are traveling with companions who can’t fl y and are too heavy to carry. Crossing the Bridge An ice bridge is a slippery surface. Anyone walking on it must make a DC 10 Balance check to move at half speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less indicates the character can’t move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means he falls prone. He can try to walk at his full speed with a –5 penalty on the check. If he is attacked while trying to balance, he is considered fl at-footed unless he has at least 5 ranks in Balance. If he takes damage while balancing, he must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing. The Balance check becomes much more dangerous near the edges of an ice bridge. If a character moves through a square that overlaps the edge of the bridge (no matter how much of the square remains ice bridge and how little remains open air), he must instead make a DC 22 Balance check. If the character falls prone, he might slide across the icy sur- face.
