        "description":  "Becoming a savant is a difficult task akin to training to become a wizard. Savants spend long years in an apprenticeship, usually at a major library, monastery, or similar center of learning. Once a savant completes his training, he must set on out his own to begin his academic research. Many savants return to the place where they first trained to present their findings in hopes of increasing their stature and renown. A savant who uncovers new lore or makes a major intellectual discovery wins tremendous respect from his peers. Feuds among savants who research similar areas are common, and some evil savants resort to trickery and murder to advance their work at the expense of their rivals. Savants tend to identify themselves by the academy where they studied. Each academy has a unique identity among savants. The Library at Atheneus might be known for studying planar phenomenon, while the Velden Collegium produces the finest historians in the world. Rivalries and competitions between these academies are both common and intense.",
