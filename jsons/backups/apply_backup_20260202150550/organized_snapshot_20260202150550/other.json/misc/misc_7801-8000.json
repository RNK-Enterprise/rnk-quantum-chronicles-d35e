Mating and egg laying can happen in almost any season of the year. Most dragon eggs are laid in a nest within the female’s lair, where the parent or parents can guard and tend them.A typical nest consists of a pit or mound, with the eggscompletely buried in loose material such as sand or leaves. A dragon egg’s ovoid shape gives it great resistance to pres-sure, and the female can walk, fight, or sleep atop the nestwithout fear of breaking her eggs. Dragons sometimes leave their eggs untended. In such cases, the female takes great care to keep the nest hidden.She or her mate (or both of them) may visit the area con-taining the nest periodically, but they take care not toapproach the nest too closely unless some danger threatensthe eggs. Hatching Dragon Eggs When a dragon egg finishes incubating, the wyrmlinginside must break out of the egg. If the parents are nearby,they often assist by gently tapping on the eggshell. Other-wise, the wyrmling must break out on its own, a processthat usually takes no more than a minute or two once the 11CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS",

She claims thatshe cannot abide thievery of any kind from her worshipers,but often turns a blind eye if such acts are performed in thename of building one’s hoard. Clergy and Temples Astilabor accepts only clerics with a neutral aspect to theiralignments, the better to remain pure to the goal of acquir-ing and protecting the hoard. Her clerics prefer not to getinvolved in conflicts between dragons, but often reward those whose hoards become large and valuable. Astilabor is revered by dragons of all types and align- ments, but actively worshiped by few. Most at least scratchout her symbol as a protective ward over their hoards. Astilabor’s worshipers are friendly toward those of Moradin and Garl Glittergold (since those gods respect the value of a gem or coin as much as anyone), but they distrust followers of Olidammara, whom they believe to be thieves at heart.

        "description":  "Heavy pick (bite) Bahamut is revered in many locales. Though all good drag- ons pay homage to Bahamut, gold, silver, and brass dragons hold him in particularly high regard. Other dragons, even evil ones (except perhaps his archrival Tiamat), respect Bahamut for his wisdom and power. In his natural form, Bahamut is a long, sinuous dragon covered in silver-white scales that sparkle and gleam even in the dimmest light. Bahamut’s catlike eyes are deep blue, as azure as a midsummer sky, some say . Others insist that Bahamut’s eyes are a frosty indigo, like the heart of a glacier. Perhaps the two merely reflect the Platinum Dragon’s shifting moods. Dogma Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil. He brooksno excuses for evil acts. In spite of this, he is among the mostcompassionate beings in the multiverse. He has limitlessempathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed, and thehelpless. He urges his followers to promote the cause ofgood, but prefers to let beings fight their own battles whenthey can. To Bahamut, it is better to offer information, heal-ing, or a (temporary) safe refuge rather than to take others’burdens upon oneself. Bahamut is served by seven great gold wyrms that often accompany him.CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Clergy and Temples Bahamut accepts only good clerics. Clerics of Bahamut, bethey dragons, half-dragons, or other beings attracted toBahamut’s philosophy, strive to take constant but subtle actionon behalf of good, intervening wherever they are needed buttrying to do as little harm as possible in the process. Many gold, silver, and brass dragons maintain simple shrines to Bahamut in their lairs, usually nothing more elab-orate than Bahamut’s symbol scribed on a wall. Bahamut’s chief foe is Tiamat, and this enmity is reflected in their worshipers. His allies includeHeironeous, Moradin, Yondalla, and otherlawful good deities. CHRONEPSIS",

He passes judgment on all drag-ons when they die, deciding wheretheir souls go in the afterlife.Unlike Lendys (see below),Chronepsis is uninterested injustice: he merely observeswhat is and is not. He is alsosingularly uninvolved inthe activities of the living,and strives to remain so. Itis said that only a cataclysmof world-shaking proportionscould rouse Chronepsis fromhis disinterest. Clergy and Temples Chronepsis has very few active wor-shipers and even fewer clerics, since mostdragons don’t possess the balanced outlook to avoidinterfering in the events they observe. The followers of Chronepsis count other faiths neither as allies nor enemies. Of the other deities, only Boccob theUncaring shares a similar outlook, but neither deity cares enough to forge an alliance. FALAZURE",

        "description":  "Scimitar (claw) The terrifying Night Dragon, Falazure, is neutral evil. He is the lord of energy draining, undeath, decay, and exhaustion. Some claim he has a decaying skeletal form, but others believe that he looks like a decrepit black dragon whose flesh is pulled tight over his bones. Dogma Falazure teaches that even a dragon’s long life span need notbe the limit to a dragon’s existence. Beyond the world of theliving is another realm, one of undeath eternal. It is gener-ally accepted that Falazure created (or had a hand in the cre-ation of ) the first undead dragons, such as dracoliches,vampiric dragons, and ghostly dragons (see Chapter 4). Clergy and Temples Among the draconic gods, perhaps only Bahamut and Tiamat have more nondragon worshipers than Falazure. Many necro- mancers of all races revere the Night Dragon, as well as intelligent undead such as liches and, especially, dracoliches. Temples to Falazure are always deep beneath the earth, cloaked in darkness and far from the sun and fresh air of the surface world. The followers of Falazure count all members of good-aligned faiths as their enemies. They may occa- sionally ally with the forces of Nerull, but such instances are rare.

Some argue that Garyx isactually insane, as a result of his longoccupation of the Windswept Depths ofPandemonium. He appears much like agreat wyrm red dragon. Dogma Garyx teaches by example,periodically traveling to theMaterial Plane to wreakunholy swaths of destruc-tion across the landscape.Those who revere himfollow this example, usingtheir power to bring ruin anddevastation. Clergy and Temples Garyx pays little or no attention to his clerics and wor-shipers, but they care not. They believe that he grants themthe power to perform acts of destruction, and that is enough.Perhaps curiously, some druids also revere the renewalaspect of Garyx, knowing that some devastation is alwaysnecessary for rejuvenation to occur. Some within the Cultof Ashardalon (see page 87) believe that the great wyrm isactually an avatar of the god Garyx. Few temples to Garyx are known to exist, though his wor- shipers often carve his symbol near their handiwork. Garyx shares traits in common with Kord and Erythnul, but has no interest in alliances.

He can (and does) appear as any dragon type, from the smallest pseudodragon to the largest great wyrm. Dogma Io cares only for his “children,” the dragons, and their con- tinued existence in the world. In some cases, this meanstaking the side of the dragons against other races. In othersituations, Io may actually help nondragons fight against adragon who would otherwise jeopardize the ongoing sur-vivability of the species as a whole. He prefers to remain uninvolved in conflicts between dragons, though if such a conflict threatens to escalate hemay step in (either personally or by dispatching Aasterinianor some other servitor).CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS Clergy and Temples Io has even fewer clerics or shrines than most of the otherdraconic deities, since his outlook is so broad and all-encompassing. Still, even the most devoted cleric ofBahamut, Tiamat, or any other dragon deity pays at least amodicum of homage to the Ninefold Dragon. He alsooccasionally finds clerics or adepts among the rep-tilian races, such as kobolds andtroglodytes. Io counts no other faiths as his enemies, knowing the value ofneutrality in outlook. Even thoseof greatly varying alignment canfind common cause under the bannerof the Ninefold Dragon. LENDYS",

She fiercely detests those who artificially prolong the life of a dragon, particularly when it is against that dragon’s will.

They prefer to destroy any un- dead they encounter, particularly draconic undead (suchas dracoliches).

Good 35CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS 36 dragons have a healthy respect for Tiamat, though they usu- ally avoid mentioning her or even thinking about her. In her natural form, Tiamat is a thick-bodied dragon with five heads and a wyvern’s tail. Each head is a different color:white, black, green, blue, and red. Her massive body isstriped in those colors. Tiamat has many consorts, including great wyrm dragons of the white, black, green, blue, and red varieties. Dogma Tiamat concerns herself with spreading evil,defeating good, and propagating evil dragons.She enjoys razing the occasional village, city,or country, but only as a diversion frommore subtle, world-spanning plots. Sheis the villain who lurks in the shad-ows. Her presence is felt butseldom seen. Tiamat constantly seeks to extend the power anddominion of evil dragonsover the land, particularlywhen her subjects findthemselves embroiled interritorial disputes withgood dragons. Tiamatunfailingly demands rev-erence, homage, and trib-ute from her subjects. Clergy and Temples Tiamat accepts only evil clerics.Tiamat’s clerics, like Tiamat herself,seek to place the world under the domination ofevil dragons. Though most evil dragons honor Tiamat, few keep shrines dedicated to her in their lairs because they don’twant Tiamat’s greedy eyes gazing at their treasure hoards.Instead, they dedicate vast, gloomy caverns to their deityand keep them stocked with treasure and sacrifices. Tiamat claims not to need allies, though most believe she has bargains with many archdevils and lawful evil deitiessuch as Hextor. Her enemies are numerous, includingHeironeous, Moradin, and, of course, Bahamut. DRAGONS BY KIND",
