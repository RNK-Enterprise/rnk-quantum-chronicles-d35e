        "description":  "Difficult ter- rain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement. When movement is hampered, each square moved into usu- ally counts as two squares, effectively reducing the distance that a character can cover in a move. For example, a character moving through difficult terrain (such as undergrowth) pays 2 squares of movement per square moved into (double the normal cost). If more than one condition applies, multiply together all additional costs that apply. (This is a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling; see page 304.) For instance, a character moving through diffi- cult terrain in darkness would pay 4 squares of movement per square moved into (double cost times double cost is quadruple cost). In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don’t have sufficient speed even to move 5 163 Illus. by J.
