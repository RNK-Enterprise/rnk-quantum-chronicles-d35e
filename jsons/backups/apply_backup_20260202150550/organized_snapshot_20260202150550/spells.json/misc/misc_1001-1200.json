        "description":  "Until expended or 10 min./level Spells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own. Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target. Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed. Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected. For example, you have three spell levels of absorption  remaining and are struck by dominate person  (cast as a 5th- level spell). Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Like- wise, if you ’re struck by disintegrate  (cast as a 6th-level spell) with four levels of absorption  remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (2/6) of the damage you would normally take from the spell. You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don ’t disap- pear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.

Any teleportation spell or effect (includ- ing all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell ’s recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleport-i n g  c r e a t u r e  w i l l  a r r i v e  ( s u b j e c t  t o  the restrictions below), the creature ’s size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay. Since a teleporting creature doesn ’t necessarily arrive at the precise loca- tion it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destina- tion was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell ’s area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn ’t give any awareness as to t h e  a c t u a l  l o c a t i o n  o f  i t s  i m m i n e n t  arrival. The spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell ’s area, though if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal.

Vardiggs are about 4 feet in diameter and weigh about 400 pounds. When they bother to, they can speak Aquan in thick, burbling voices. To determine the type of spell-object inside a vardigg, roll d%: 01 –70, resist energy; 71–100, sleet storm. COMBAT Vardiggs usually hide below the surface of a body of water, waiting to attack any who approach. Water Jet (Sp): As a standard action, a water grue can create a tremendously powerful 30-foot line of water. Any creature in the area of the line takes 2d6 points of damage (Reﬂ ex DC 11 negates). A creature failing the saving throw must succeed on a Strength check or a Balance check (DC 5 + damage dealt) or be knocked prone by the force of the blast. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Skills: A water grue has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered, and can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. ELEMENTAL MONOLITH Like their lesser kin, elemental monoliths are living incarna- tions of the elemental forces that compose the multiverse. They are so powerful that only the mightiest of summoning spells can draw them to the Material Plane and compel their service, and even then the caster dare not take his attention from the monolith ’s control for even a moment. Monoliths are great rulers and princes among their kind, obeyed by even the elder elementals. Only the primal elementals are more powerful.

Lords of the Elemental Plane of Air, air monoliths seldom leave their home plane unless summoned. They speak Auran, and though they are much less taciturn than other elementals, they still choose their words with care. The voice of an air monolith sounds like the roaring of a tremendous windstorm. Combat Air monoliths ﬁ ght much like other air elementals, but are far stronger. Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a –2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls against an air monolith. Whirlwind (Su):  An air monolith can transform itself into a whirlwind at will as a standard action and remain in that form inde ﬁ nitely. In this form, the monolith can move through the air or along a surface at its ﬂ y speed. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The monolith controls the exact height, but it must be at least 20 feet. The air monolith ’s movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the monolith enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the monolith moves into or through the creature ’s space. Huge or smaller creatures take damage when caught in a whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 39 Re ﬂ e x  s a v e  w h e n  i t  c o m e s  i n t o contact with the whirlwind or take 4d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 39 Re ﬂ ex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, auto- matically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can ﬂ y is allowed a Re ﬂ ex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based. A creature trapped in a whirlwind cannot move except to go where the air monolith carries it or to escape the whirlwind. 620_17925_Chpt6.indd   156 620_17925_Chpt6.indd   156 9/15/04   11:23:56 AM 9/15/04   11:23:56 AMCHAPTER 6 ARCANE MONSTERS 157It can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concen- tration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. A monolith can have only as many creatures trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will ﬁ t inside the whirlwind ’s volume. An air monolith can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned monolith always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the whirlwind ’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the air monolith and has a diameter equal to half the monolith ’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

Any spells selected must be from the conjuration, evo- cation, or necromancy school. The number of spell-like abilities is cumulative; for example, a spell-stitched undead with a Wisdom of 12 can cast two 2nd-level spells four times per day and two 1st-level spells four times per day. Caster level equals the creature ’s Hit Dice. Example Spells Times per Wisdom Undead Imbued Day10 Skeleton, zombie Two 1st-level 411–12 Bodak Two 2nd-level 4 13–14 Ghoul, ghast Two 3rd-level 2 15–16 Devourer Two 4th-level 2 17–18 Some liches Two 5th-level 2 19 or higher Nightshade One 6th-level 1 The creator of a spellstitched creature decides how to allocate the spells known against the number of times per day spells of each level can be cast, and once made, this determination cannot be changed. For example, if a spellstitched skeleton has cause fear  usable once per day and shocking grasp usable three times per day imbued as its 1st-level spell-like abili-ties, its creator cannot later change either the spells or how frequently each can be used (to two times per day each, for example).",
