An attack or an area spell inside such a building deals damage to the structure more easily.

Anyone inside a collapsing building takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage for each floor of the building’s height (assum- ing 10 feet of height for each story of the structure) and is pinned beneath the rubble. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage and avoids the pin. A character can escape the pin with a successful DC 24 grapple or Escape Artist check. Each round a character remains pinned, he takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. Lamp Smoke:  In cities that use oil lamps for illumi- nation, smoke can accumulate in small alleys or narrow roads.

        "description":  "Never. Buildings:  Warehouses (30%), poor trades (5%), poor services (10%), poor residences (53%). Description: Large, bulky buildings dominate the neighborhood, ﬁ  lled with goods not yet ready for sale or shipment. While a few are well maintained, most warehouses are old and dirty—so long as they are sturdy enough to protect the merchandise, their appearance is unimportant. Many of the people who live nearby work in these warehouses, hauling and stacking crates. Occasionally merchants and nobles—or more likely their servants—escort their goods into storage or come down to check on their possessions. Hired guards protect many warehouses, since the city watch does not reliably patrol poor neighborhoods. Plot Hook:  A n  u n s c r u p u l o u s  m e r c h a n t  h a s  b e e n transporting exotic creatures for sale to the rich and jaded. He keeps the beasts drugged for shipment, but one of them awoke and broke free of its crate, and it is now terrorizing the surrounding neighborhoods. Even if the PCs manage to track down the creature, the merchant uses his political connections to hamper their investigation into where it came from. The distrac- tions caused by this affair are slowing down the rest of his trade, increasing the risk that more creatures will awaken and escape. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   48620_95386_Ch1.indd   48 8/21/06   4:51:10 PM8/21/06   4:51:10 PMn urban adventurer is not quite like her more traditional, far-ranging counterpart. She tends to be less ﬂ  ashy, and perhaps more prone to subtler, more focused techniques. She often lets adven- ture come to her, rather than going in search of it. And while she might certainly seek fortune and glory, she might just be someone who’d rather live an ordinary life, if only circumstances would permit it. This isn’t to say an urban adventurer never  seeks out excite- ment and danger. From the monster-infested sewers to the orc armies at the walls to the demons and doppelgangers in the highest levels of government, most cities boast more than enough evil to seek out and destroy. Still, an urban adventurer likely has close personal ties to the city—or else why would she stay? She might seek to defend her home, to rise through the ranks to a position of power, to support her guild or house, or simply to smite evil and earn a few gold pieces without leaving the comforts of civilization. Whatever the case, her skills and abilities—to say nothing of her attitudes—differ somewhat from those adventurers who wander out into the world, rarely thinking of home. The most important distinction between traditional and urban adventurers, especially spellcasters, has to do with their methods. Fireball and lightning bolt  are main- stays of the dungeon delver or the dragon hunter, but they simply aren’t practical when battling thugs in an alley or monsters on Main Street. The ﬁ  ghter who counts on his wizard’s enlarge person  to make him truly potent when ﬁ  ghting giants could be in a tight spot when he tries to use the same trick inside a guildhall. The city’s enclosed nature, and the presence of innocent bystanders, mean that adventurers must be a lot more selective in their techniques. Save the ﬁ  reballs  for warding off invading armies or battling otyughs in the cavernous chambers deep beneath the city, and read on for more appropriate methods and abilities for city streets and the halls of power. WHAT TO DO, WHERE TO GO Welcome to the city! Now you’re surrounded by dozens of adventure sites, thousands of NPCs, and a concentration of wealth that beggars the hoard of the greediest dragon. Urban adventuring can be overwhelming—compared to dungeons, there’s just more  of everything. Succeeding in a city is often a matter of knowing how to extract what you want from the teeming multitude of choices available. 49Illus. by D. BirchamIllus. by D.

        "description":  "Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (the planes), Spellcraft. Duties:  Congregants of a dominant church must either donate 10% of their income or volunteer 1 hour a week to aid in maintaining the church’s temples and performing the faith’s works in the city. Unsurpris- ingly, most individuals choose the latter option. True members of the church must spend at least 20 hours a week devoted to religious and administrative duties, which might range from leading services to standing guard over church property to working in the church library. A DC 25 Diplomacy check allows a PC to count time spent adventuring with his companions toward this requirement, if the adventure speciﬁ  cally advances the cause of the church or if the PC is willing to tithe 10% of all treasure he ﬁ  nds to the church. Favored Beneﬁ  ts: A member of a dominant church gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks involving anyone from the local government, major mer- cantile concerns such as guilds, or members of smaller churches in the city. Additionally, a member has access to the church’s library and records. He can take 20 on any Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (religion) check after he has been actively engaged in research in the church library (reading books and speaking to other members), a process that takes 1d4+1 days for each check. Sample Contact:  Archbishop Calapri (expert 12). Calapri will ofﬁ  cially sanction an adventure or quest, allowing the PCs to freely cross borders anywhere the church is dominant, and expanding the PCs’ church-based Diplomacy and Intimidate bonuses to work in those areas as well. Once only. INDEPENDENT An independent church is a temple or association of temples that, due to lack of size, wealth, or political inﬂ  u- ence, is a less powerful entity than the dominant church of the region. Perhaps the deity is not widely worshiped in the city, and has only one temple—or at most a hand-ful of them—to his name. The religion might be new to the city, and thus has not had time to expand, or it might face resistance from the entrenched churches. All too frequently, an independent church has failed to expand because it is oppressed, either by the local government or the dominant church. And sometimes, a church simply fails to catch on in a given population, or exists in a region where the dominant church holds so much of the popula- tion that the smaller faiths cannot compete. Independent churches contain religious guilds and various sects, but not to the same extent as dominant ones. Both obscure gods and well-known but less popular ones make up the bulk of the independent faiths. Examples:  Church of St. Cuthbert, Church of Wee Jas. Associated Skills:  Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (the planes), Spellcraft. Duties:  Congregants of an independent church are required to tithe 5% of their income, or volunteer 1 hour of their time per week. Formal members of the church must spend at least 20 hours a week devoted to religious and administrative duties. A successful DC 20 Diplomacy check allows a PC to count time spent adventuring with his companions toward this requirement, if the adven-ture speciﬁ  cally advances the cause of the church or if the PC is willing to tithe 10% of all treasure he ﬁ  nds to the church. 620_95386_Ch3.indd   107620_95386_Ch3.indd   107 8/22/06   9:21:50 AM8/22/06   9:21:50 AM108 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWER Favored Beneﬁ  ts: Members of independent churches make a concerted effort to aid one another. The discount for hiring a fellow member to cast a spell or perform a service is 10%, rather than the standard 5%. (Characters who abuse this privilege—taking advantage of it when not absolutely necessary—could ﬁ  n d  i t  s tri p p e d  a w a y from them at the DM’s discretion.) Sample Contact:  Father Leopold (cleric 10). Leopold will cast atonement  on a PC or one of his companions. Once only, but could be persuaded to do it a second time if the situation warrants. CULT A cult is a small organization made up of followers asso-ciated with the same faith. Cults are smaller than other churches, with little (if any) political or social power. In most instances, cults are devoted to obscure, unpopular, or even illegal entities. The most common example is a cult devoted to a vile deity or an archﬁ  end, but cults might also be dedicated to foreign gods, or even gods of goodness and light in an evil culture. Also uncommon but not unheard of in major cities are bands of nature-worshipers, many of which qualify as cults. Cults might not have any true temples, relying instead on tiny shrines or altars tucked away in otherwise secular structures. Many cults are secret organizations, and they look with suspicion on anyone who seeks them out. Examples:  Cult of Asmodeus, Cult of Tharizdun, druidic circle. Associated Skills:  Bluff, Knowledge (local), Knowl- edge (religion), Knowledge (arcana, or  nature, or  the planes, whichever is most appropriate), Spellcraft. Duties:  Congregants of a cult must spend at least 4 hours per week in worship and ceremonies. Formal members of the cult must spend at least 20 hours a week in service to it. A successful DC 20 Diplomacy check allows a PC to count time spent adventuring with his companions toward this requirement, if the adventure speciﬁ  cally advances the cause of the cult or if the PC is willing to tithe 10% of all treasure he ﬁ  nds to the cult. Favored Beneﬁ  ts: Membership in this small, tightly knit group strengthens an individual’s faith and determi- nation. When accompanied by at least one other member of the cult, or when within the cult’s shrines or holdings, a member receive a +1 bonus on Will saves made against spells cast by anyone not part of the cult.",

If psionics are common in your game, you have two op - tions. The first is to allow spellthieves to affect both spells and psionic powers. The second is to create a new class, the psithief, that functions identically to the spellthief except that its special abilities affect psionic powers only. In either case, a spellthief who can affect psionic powers treats psionic powers as if they were spells of the same level, allowing him to steal, absorb, or discover known psionic powers as normal for spells. A spellthief can’t augment a stolen power, even if he has power points available of his own. Treat psi-like abilities as spell-like abilities for the purpose of a spellthief’s stealing these abilities. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsﬁ  nding a suitable prestige class involves making sure that your character’s new suite of abilities fulﬁ  lls a needed role in the party. If your character is the primary trapﬁ  nder or scout, you’ll want to make sure that the prestige class doesn’t diminish those abilities while still providing you with interesting options in combat. Good Guys/Bad Guys:  Members of these groups define themselves by their alignment and their outlook on the world first, and their other abilities second. Their strengths reflect their alignment choices, and roleplaying one of these characters means putting attitude first.",

No one ever discovered the clan’s honorless actions, and to this day, no one knows what clan the ghost-faced killers came from. Today ghost- faced killers act as assassins and spies for hire, a mercenary clan that hides behind a guise of open and honorable con - duct. When on a mission, they wear porcelain demon- masks of ghostly white to hide their identities and as a symbol of the pact their clan made with the demon-spir - its. Through training and discipline, ghost-faced killers learn the deadliest and most terrifying ways to attack foes, and through their mystic con - nection with spirits, ghost-faced killers learn to turn invisible, walk through walls, and even see with the eyes of the spirits them - selves. Most ghost-faced killers be - gin their careers as rangers or rogues, though ninjas are also common. Fighters are only slightly less common. Few monks, barbarians, or members of spell - casting classes choose to become ghost-faced killers, but such char - acters are not unknown. NPC ghost-faced killers are members of the Ghost-Faced Killer clan of ninjas. This clan disguises itself as a normal samurai clan, loyal to the empire but unworthy of notice. Most of the time a ghost-faced killer simply pursues his responsi - bilities to the clan and the emperor, but when called by money or the clan daimyo the ghost-faced killer dons the mask that means death for his enemies.",
