While she might stay for a night at an isolated farmhouse or briefly share a woodsman’s hut, she is likely to avoid settlements altogether, visiting animal populations instead. A wandering druid may have a major impact on an area she passes through without the human or humanoid residents even being aware of her presence. Her goals are to see all the wide variety of animals and plants the world holds (or as many as can be encountered in one life time) and to restore balance where nature is suffering.

This section corpses to the Positive Energy Plane, in this case reversing the expands on the undead traits already noted in the description of fl ow of energy. the undead type on page 317 of the Monster Manual. 7 1 RETPAHC TUOBA LLA DAEDNU UNDEAD METABOLISM With rare exceptions, undead have little or no metabolism to speak of. Undead are essentially animated by negative energy, though this anima- tion is sometimes dependent upon the undead’s ability to feed. Still, while biology plays little part in the existence of these creatures, the undead do have some similarities to living beings. Like ectothermic (cold-blooded) creatures, the unliving lack the ability to produce their own heat and must depend on their environment for warmth. This inability to produce heat is a defi ning undead characteristic, most remarked upon by scholars and those who encounter them, and often compared to the chill of the grave. To classify undead as cold- blooded creatures would be inaccurate, however, since undead are mostly bloodless. Like ectotherms, undead take on the temperature of their surround- ings. However, unlike cold-blooded living creatures, undead are not unduly harmed by particularly low temperatures (unless they become frozen solid) or particularly high temperatures (unless they begin to smolder and burn). Diet Some undead exist for centuries without interact- ing with any living beings, while others seem to require, or at least crave with an unstoppable pas- sion, the fl esh, energy, or life force of the still living. However, even undead that do not need to eat may have a preferred morsel. Essentially, some undead can choose to eat if they desire, even if they have no requirement to consume. They could eat even ordinary food, if they desired to appear normal or were interested in trying to tease out some hint of fl avor; undead with tongues, such as ghouls and skirrs (see page 120) actually retain their sense of taste. Some undead glory in their ability to feed off the living. Others, especially the more intelligent, romanticize or even eroticize their need to feed on the living to maintain their strength (or to feed their addiction). Still, despite the fact that this feeding ability is often dangerous (or even deadly) to those who oppose them, the hunger behind it is a major weakness for many undead. With all of this in mind, undead feeding require- ments can be broken into three types: not required, inescapable craving, and diet dependent.",

Nearly 450 beholders and beholder mages live lation of about two thousand, and is located on a volcanic, mist-shrouded island. Rumor holds that ten or possibly more allied hive mothers jointly rule Kaggash. Somewhere on the cold, barren slopes of Mungoth, the third layer of Gehenna, looms the beholder hive-tower of Uldinath. This massive spire is honeycombed with The beholder hive city Kaggash tunnels and is home to a hive of nearly three hundred half-fi end director beholderkin bonded to bonespears (Fiend Folio page 24). Uldinath is ruled by Tchkarthu, a half-fi end elder orb and 20th-level sor- cerer. Tchkarthu desires to gain the power to command beholders as a hive mother does, and given its resources, it might just fi nd what it seeks. LAIRS A typical beholder lair consists of a winding maze of passageways bored through solid rock with disintegrate eye rays. These tunnels tend to be perfectly smooth and round, with a 10- foot radius. Beholders know that their ability to fl y gives them a dis- tinct tactical advantage, so most lairs incorporate a large number of vertical shafts. This hinders intrud- ers attempting to penetrate the lair and keeps prisoners from easily escaping. A typical lair consists of three to fi ve additional chambers. The far- thest chamber from the entrance is the beholder’s personal quarters, where the creature sleeps and studies any magic treasure it has accumulated. Beholders are too arrogant to incorporate escape tunnels into their quarters; doing so only invites an invasion on multiple fronts. In any case, a beholder can quickly create its own escape tunnel, if need be, with its disintegrate eye ray. Between the 50 TYRANTS THE EYE CHAPTER 3 quarters and the lair entrance are two or more chambers these cases, a beholder employs charmed gatherers—creatures used to house guardians. Most beholders keep another room capable of traversing great distances quickly and penetrating off to the side of the main complex to dispose of waste or to secure sites with ease. A beholder sends a spy to determine hold prisoners. A beholder with a favored minion (such as the probable location of an object or person it needs, and a representative, see below) allows that minion his or her then sends a gatherer to fi nish the job.

Guardians: The majority of a beholder’s minions are guardians, creatures selected to protect the lair.
