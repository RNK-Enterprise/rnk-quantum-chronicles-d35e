They are closely related to satyrs; in fact, some suspect that fauns are a result of cross-breeding between satyrs and humans or perhaps elves. Fauns are essentially human in shape, standing nearly 6 feet high, with bestial-looking faces, flowing manes of hair (including 133 PANTHEON Illus. by R. Guay THE OLYMPIAN CHAPTER 4: beards on the males), and short, goatlike tails. They do not favor clothing, but they will wear it in their dealings with humans. Instead, they paint their bodies with natural colors, especially bright reds and striking blacks that contrast with their light brown complexions. They have no horns. Fauns speak Sylvan and Common. Combat Fauns dislike combat and avoid it when possible. They have no misguided notions of courage or honor that would interfere with fleeing from a dangerous foe. They are not cowardly; they simply do not fight if it is not necessary. Faun Traits (Ex):Fauns benefit from a number of racial traits. • Low-light vision. • Musical Ability: When a faun uses a magic flute or set of pipes, includingpipes of haunting, pipes of pain, pipes of the sewers, orpipes of sounding, the saving throw DC for any effect of the item is increased by +2. In addition, a faun character with the Use Magic Device skill can use a satyr’s pipes to create the magical effects that satyrs produce on the pipes. The check DC is the same as for emulating a race, DC 25. • Musical Resistance: Fauns receive a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist musical effects, including sonic spells, bardic music,Otto’s irresistible dance,and the effects of magical pipes, harps, lyres, and other instruments.",

        "description":  "AVOIDING TWILIGHT Any dragon that has reached the old age category or higher can depart, become a guardian, or become a dracolich. (Details ofdracolichdom can be found on page 146.) To depart or become a guardian, a dragon must consume at least 135,000 gp worth of treasure—or at least 90% of its hoard,if the dragon possesses treasure worth more than 150,000 gp. All the treasure must be consumed in the same day, and at least 120,000 gp of this treasure must have been part of thedragon’s hoard for at least 200 years.After consuming the required amount of treasure, the dragon must find a dragon graveyard or suitable site to guard. Once it is at the graveyard or site, the dragon completes the processinstantly simply by willing it to happen. When a dragon departs, its body dies. When a dragon be- comes a guardian, its body melds into the landscape. Once it has consumed the treasure, a dragon can delay departing orbecoming a guardian for no more than 1 day per point of Charisma it has. If the dragon exceeds this time limit, the oppor- tunity is lost, and the dragon cannot make another attempt todepart until it again consumes the required amount of treasure. pqqqqrspqqqqrs 16hoard. Most dragons also travel to a dragon graveyard and die there. Dragon graveyards are ancient places whose origins are lost even to dragon memory . As a rule, they are accessibleonly to flying creatures, being situated on mountaintops, inhidden valleys (surrounded by jungle, deserts, or moun-tains), on islands located in windless or storm-tossed seas, orin the depths of great rifts on the earth. Within the graveyard, dangers abound. Storms of ele- mental energy often wash over dragon graveyards, andelemental vortexes often appear in random spots. Some ofthese may belch forth groups of hostile elemental crea-tures or suck the unwary right off the Material Plane andonto an elemental plane. Dragon carcasses or skeletonsmay spontaneously animate and walk about, attacking anyliving creatures they meet. Dragon graveyards also are haunted by ghostly dragons.Despite the dangers, dragon graveyards often draw visitors. According to legend, and some reputed discoveries, not all ofa departed dragon’s consumed hoard is always destroyed, andmany treasure hunters (showing dragonlike greed) eagerlyseek out dragon graveyards for the treasures they are saidto contain. Other visitors seek to obtain dragon remains for magical or alchemical purposes. Guardianship At the end of its normal life, a dragon can elect to become aguardian, literally transforming into part of the landscape.After the dragon consumes its hoard, it changes itself intoa geographic feature: hills, mountains, lakes, swamps, andgroves seem to be the most common choices. Such areas become favorite places for dragons to lay their eggs. It is said that no nest of dragon eggs laid in such alocale will ever be disturbed. Wyrmling dragons living inthe site are said to commune with the guardian spirit, receiv-ing the knowledge they need to become strong adults. As with dragon graveyards, legends say that some of the late dragon’s treasure may still remain hidden at the site,making these features prime targets for treasure hunters.Extracting the treasure (if it exists at all) is apt to be diffi-cult. Younger dragons living at the site usually resent intru-sions, as do absentee parents who have laid eggs there (aswe have seen, dragons that leave their eggs untended oftenstill keep watch over their nests). These sites also attractCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS",

The feature created always resembles a dragon in some subtle manner. The contours of a hill might suggest a sleeping dragon, for example, or a lake might have the shape of adragon’s head or footprint. Dragon eggs laid in a guarded area become hidden by non- detection andmirage arcana effects, provided the female laying them is of the same kind as the guardian. Both effects lasts until the eggs hatch, and neither effect has a magical aura, but other- wise they function as the spells cast by a 20th-level caster. Any dragon of the same kind as the guardian and of juvenile age or younger can visit the area once a month and receive the benefits of a commune spell. Older dragons of the same kind as the guardian get the same benefit, but only once a year.

Such a treasure containscoins and goods only and is of a level equal to one quarter of the guardian’s Challenge Rating at the time of its transforma- tion.

DRACOLICHDOM Some evil dragons enlist the aid of others to cheat death.The dragon and its servants create an inanimate object,called a phylactery, that will hold the dragon’s life force. Next, a special brew is prepared for the dragon to con- sume. The potion is a lethal poison that slays the dragon forwhich it was prepared without fail. Upon the death of the dragon, its spirit transfers itself to the phylactery . From the phylactery, the spirit can occupy anydead body that lies close by, including its own former body . Ifthe body it currently inhabits is destroyed, the spirit returnsto the phylactery, and from there it can occupy a new body . See the Dracolich entry, page 146, for details on the results of this process. DRAGON SENSES “Dragons don’t see very well in the dark. They don’t hear sowell, either.” —The late Aylmer Dapynto, erstwhile sage and dragon hunter “You want to live a long and profitable life? Then don’t try to sneak past a dragon!” —Lidda, advising a young rogueLike any predatory creature, a dragon has acute senses. These remarkable senses become even better as a dragongrows and ages, mostly because a dragon’s mind becomesever more perceptive as the centuries pass. A dragon’s eyes,ears, and nose may not become any more sharper with age,but the dragon’s prodigious intellect can sift increasingamounts of information from its environment. VISION Dragons have vision superbly adapted to hunting. They enjoyexcellent depth perception, which allows them to judge dis-tances with great accuracy, and they have outstanding periph-eral vision as well. Dragons can perceive motion and detail atleast twice as well as a human in daylight, and their eyesadapt quickly to harsh light and glare. A dragon can stare atthe sun on a clear summer day and suffer no loss of vision.Eagles and other birds of prey can perform similar visualfeats. Such creatures often have poor night vision—and itmay be this fact that leads some scholars to conclude thatdragons don’t see well in the dark. In fact, dragons see exceedingly well in dim light. In moon- light, dragons see as well as they can in sunlight. In evendimmer light, a dragon sees four times as far as a human canunder similar conditions. Dragons can even see with nolight at all. When any illumination is present, a dragon sees in color. Its ability to discern hues is at least as good as a human’s. Inthe absence of light, a dragon’s vision is black-and-white. 17CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT DRAGONS",

A true dragon ignores the detrimental effects of extreme heat (110 °F to 140 °F) and of extreme cold (0 °F to –40 °F). A true dragon in these conditions does not have to make a Fortitudesave every 10 minutes to avoid taking nonlethal damage. All creatures of the dragon type are immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects, also as noted in the Monster Manual .

True dragons also develop spell resistance as they age, as noted in the Monster Manual . pqqqqrspqqqqrsdragons prefer damp and dismal swamps, and they also have the ability to create magical darkness. Copper drag-ons live in rocky hills and have the ability to shape stone.Often a dragon’s innate abilities have little direct impact oncombat, but the dragon can use them to defend its lair orto prepare for battle. A dragon’s spells tend to reflect its own personality . Each dragon develops a unique personal repertoire of spells(though many dragons choose similar spells for their sheerutility). No scholar has determined how dragons accom-plish this, and it seems that dragons themselves don’tknow how they do it. Dragons simply have an inborntalent for arcane magic. They develop rudimentary spell-casting powers as they approach adulthood. Humanoidsorcerers, who often claim their magical powers stemfrom a dragon ancestor, usually do not develop any magi-cal aptitude until after puberty . Some scholars take this asa sign that no connection at all exists between sorcerersand dragons.
