As with other blood magic this is almost predominantly the province of arcane spellcasters, I though many barbarian warriors and some more t is said that blood magic is one of the oldest civilized soldiers also learn a blood bond or two, forms of arcane magic, based on the most recognizing quite correctly that nothing brings primitive, but extremely powerful, rituals comrades together quite so effectively as a vow of of spilling blood. To the savage, lifeblood is blood brotherhood. something that is clearly full of magical energy, for if you deprive anyone of it they grow weak and die, losing all their own life energy. Any magician who can access this energy must be powerful indeed, for he can tap into the secrets of life and death themselves. The first blood magicians were primitive sorcerers, perhaps because the secrets of written language, and the wizardry based on it, were unknown in those days. Today many wizards also learn some blood magic, though sorcerers are still the most commonly met blood magicians. Something about its immediate and barbaric nature seems to appeal strongly to them, and their flexibility also means they can use the energy gained from human sacrifices more easily than can wizards, though of course not all practitioners of blood magic also engage in human sacrifice. A great many philosophical systems have recognised the power in blood, likening it to the very force that animates living creatures. Blood magic also ties in with these ideas, and certain blood magicians approach it not so much from the perspective of the savage power it can offer, but in an attempt to discover more about the magical underpinnings of the world. Even these scholars sometimes find their lofty ambitions fallen by the wayside, as they delve a little too deeply into the practices of blood magic, discovering their own inner lust for power and sacrifice rather than any new insight into philosophy and science. 44 BLOOD MAGIC - AN OVERVIEW The Blood Plane Perhaps their most terrifying practice though is blood sacrifice, whereby a skilled blood magician Some scholars of blood magic talk of a demiplane can gain immediate magical energy by spilling known as the blood plane. This is said to be much another’s lifeblood. Many a blood magician like an elemental plane but devoted to blood rather has done so in a time of necessity, for the than one of the conventional elements, and is blood of others is simply such a convenient and postulated as the source of blood magic and the concentrated form of power.

With the attentions of a good Blood magic is exclusively practised by arcane spellcasters, usually sorcerers but sometimes wizards or others. Certain shamans, druids and evil clerics learn a similar magic, again based around sacrifice and magical oaths, but though related it is beyond the scope of this volume. The greatest difference between the two approaches is the difference found between arcane and divine spellcasters everywhere: the former are largely concerned with either personal power or the advancement of science through experiment and discovery, whereas the latter are more interested in venerating a god or other higher power. The blood magic of each is tailored accordingly, and so the bloodrites and spells found in this volume relate for the most part to the concerns of arcane spellcasters, though in many cases a hangover from the more primitive origins of blood magic can be found, with bloodrites concerned with the maintenance of savage tribal structures and so forth. 66 THE BASICS OF BLOOD MAGIC The Basics regions become depopulated, all for the power and bloodthirstiness of one wizard. of Blood The more basic bonds of blood, such as blood brotherhood, also have a parallel tradition among barbarians and other traditional fighting-men of all Magic kinds. These folk, who rarely have any true arcane knowledge or any ability to cast spells, are either continuing half-remembered primitive rituals or re-inventing blood magic from first principles. In T his chapter details the various different any case the continued existence of this tradition sorcerers, wizards, and occasional others seems to support the theories of those who regard who learn blood magic, as well as how a blood magic as one of the most primal and ancient character might track a mentor down and persuade of magical paths. him to pass on vital knowledge. It also looks at the mechanics of learning and using blood magic. Practitioners of blood magic are for the most part human, though certain tribal monsters such as orcs Folk of Blood and hobgoblins occasionally learn a little, as of course do vampires. All arcane spellcasters can Perhaps the most well-known practitioners of use blood magic, so long as they can find someone blood magic are sorcerers from the most primitive to teach them; the simpler rituals of blood bonding tribes, half-magician, half-witch doctor, barely can also be learned by soldiers, warriors and other worthy of the name ‘sorcerer’ at all.

Bloodrites may be learned by any character who can find a teacher. The character does not need to learn the bloodrite in place of a spell, feat, or anything else; it is additional to all these things. There is an experience point cost to learn each bloodrite, however, and most also have an experience point cost to cast them. Usually a teacher will charge the character 1d4 x (XP cost to learn) in gold pieces to teach him the bloodrite.

Celtic. Bits of the flavour text were inspired by my dim memories of reading part of an excellent Ian Sturrock book on human sacrifice called The Highest Altar, author unknown, some years back, which I think 6600 DESIGNERS NOTES The Crimson Book of Keddah takes a more general approach, postulating that blood magic was the first act of magic, performed by the first sorcerers throughout the known lands, not just among the Bl’taxu. This manual gives detailed formulae for the correct employment of various blood magical rituals, including sacrifices, bonds and the creation of blood creatures. The author claims that in the days before even the gods existed, the first sorcerers recognised the power inherent in lifeblood, and spilled it on high moun- taintops, identifying those places with themselves. The descendants of those first sorcerers continued their forefathers’ traditions, slaying more, giving blood to empower the mountains, which they now called by the names of their ancestors, the first sorcerers. After sufficient sacrifices had been made so that all the local folk remembered was that the mountain was hungry, and demanded innocent lives, it is written that these mountains became the first gods. Though this is clearly an addled fancy on the part of the author, the frightening thing about it is not only the startling similarities with the Bl’taxu tales, but also the parallels with the earliest myths of many of the world’s foremost religions. Such a large number of these have similar stories, but with their own gods as the heroes who, at the dawn of time, swept away an earlier race of evil, bloodthirsty gods, doing away with the old, evil ways. Those who continue to worship the old gods – a few druids, for the most part – have their own divine magic use for human sacrifice, apparently parallel to the arcane magical path of blood magic, though such sects are secretive and I have ascertained very little about it for certain. Similarly certain evil clerics of blood- gods appear to follow similar traditions of sacrifice, though whether they worship primal old gods, or those of the new gods that preferred the old ways out of active evil rather than simple reverence for the past, is unclear. Could it be that the gods themselves have only ever been powerful sorcerers, making themselves more pow- erful still by enticing others to sacrifice to them? For even the second wave of gods, as depicted in ancient myth, seem to have once been thirsty for innocent blood, though to their credit they are usually portrayed as having rapidly evolved beyond that stage and made war on those gods who still demanded sacrifice. Taking the following factors together, the greatly increased effects of blood sacrifices performed on the highest mountaintops, along with the presence of many of the most holy sites for the oldest religions in high places and the tendency of primitive religions to view the afterlife as somehow ‘higher’ than the present life, before our modern understanding of the varied planes of the multiverse, would seem to support this, as would the Bl’taxu traditions and the Crimson Book. The above, then, is the core of the Elder Blood Hypothesis, as put forward by Royal Sages Bax and Glawker in by far the best of their works, The Bloody Origins of Religion, shortly before they and their library were burned to the ground by a mob apparently composed of leading worshippers from all the main contempo- rary religions. In any event, it is perhaps better not to give too much credence to the Crimson Book of Keddah. Certain re- cent scholarship, in particular the inspired works of the High Inquisitor-Theologian of Narlak, indicate the Crimson Book to be of relatively recent date, a simple apology for the vile practices of blood magic, written but a scant few hundred years ago. It is would seem inadvisable to argue with his penetrating analysis of the situation.",
