A chwidencha is an abomination spawned from a drow who failed one of Lolth’s many tests. STRATEGY AND TACTICS A chwidencha is a bold combatant, scuttling forward on its many legs to drive its claws into the soft fl esh of its foes. It relies on the element of surprise, attacking fast and prefer- ably fi rst. It often lies in wait just beneath the earth’s surface, waiting for prey to come within range, then pouncing to grab and impale the creature on its barbed claws. Once it slays its prey, it retreats into its burrow or another hidden location to devour its meal at leisure. If a chwidencha is damaged before it has subdued its prey, it retreats, dragging the victim with it to fi nish off in a safe place. When encountered in groups, chwidenchas attack en masse. Emboldened by their numbers, they do not content themselves with single victims but slay every living thing 108 4 RETPAHC WORD TNEMPIUQE pqqqqqqqqqrs CHWIDENCHA LORE Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) can research chwidenchas to learn more about them.

The mere sight of an attacking chwidencha terrifies its opponents.

They are consummate hunters of the Underdark, stalking their prey with cunning and patience. Relentless explorers, they always seek to penetrate to the deepest places of the earth, never before trod by a sentient creature, to reveal what wonders such undiscovered caverns might hold. They are extremely avaricious and covet all wealth—especially magic items. Legends speak of a mystical realm called Azarakka that was hidden deep beneath the surface when Io, creator of all dragons, fi rst laid the foundation of the world. The dragon who fi rst discovers this fabled cavern, so the legend goes, will be privy to the ancient knowledge of the Ninefold Dragon and ascend to the ranks of the dragon deities. Whether the deep dragons believe this tale is unknown, but scholars spec- ulate that the allure of this prize fi rst drew their progenitors from the skies of their heritage to Phazeuroth, a deep dragon the dark places of the earth.

If given the opportunity before battle, a vril spends some time observing its enemies to determine what sort of weaponry most of them wield. It then uses its skinshift ability to offset the applicable type of damage before closing to melee. It readies a shriek attack, waiting for enemies to bunch together. A group of vril tries to space those with Dazing Shriek as evenly as possible through its forward line to create overlap- ping areas of effect. Once a signifi cant portion of the foes have been dazed, a second rank of vril charges into battle to slaughter as many as possible.

The front of the thing has the face of a pale elf twisted in terrible pain. The hideous shunned are the accursed of Lolth.

STRATEGY AND TACTICS A shunned hates all creatures and seeks to make them suffer as much as or more than it does. It lures creatures to battlefi elds of its choosing with dancing lights, and uses darkness to best take advantage of its environment. As its prey draws near, a shunned vomits forth swarms of spiders; once the battle begins, it lurks in the shadows while its minions contend with the enemy. The shunned readies an action to cast dispel magic to counter any signifi cant magic attacks its foes might cast. Once the oppo- nents have focused their efforts against the spider swarms, the shunned creeps forward, using suggestion to drive off tougher prey before it closes to deliver its venomous bite.

They typically hunt in packs, killing and eating any non-drow that happen by their lairs. Tunnel thugs operate alone or form organized groups. Filth-Eater Gang (EL 13–15): Packs of two to four fi lth- eaters scavenge for food around their lairs. Any living creature other than drow is a target for their frenzied attacks. A pack of fi lth-eaters in a battle rage usually provides ample alarm to nearby drow listening posts. Retributive Strike (EL 14–18): Tunnel thugs usually pursue intruders singly or in small squads, though sometimes they guide drow hunting parties. EL 14: This solitary tunnel thug is in pursuit of a thief who managed to infi ltrate the com- pound of a ranking drow house and steal an item of value. EL 17: Two tunnel thugs lead a strike squad of four Lolth’s Stings (see page 78) and two dark snipers (see page 75) under the command of a house captain (see page 170).

She personally oversaw the execution of the last of the members of House Everhate, and her lust for power and taste for blood threaten to consume her. She believes that House Xaniqos rises by the divine mandate of Lolth. It remains to be seen whether her belief is correct or the rise is due to a chaotic whim of the Spider Queen, but Thandysha’s personal power cannot be questioned.

As a result, she grew embit- tered (even more than is usual for drow) and fell into the life of an enforcer for hire. Her rates are low, and she works mainly for middle- and lower-class employers, not wanting to draw too much attention from the powers that be. Xil, as she is usually called, excels in her work because she likes to infl ict pain. She wears dark clothing and keeps her silver hair (which has a slight blue tint) in a loose ponytail. The mind blades she manifests are always of a dark burgundy color. She tries to deal maximum damage when possible with her psychic strike and psionic weapon abilities in addition to the +2 psychokinetic burst power of her mind blade. She carries no weapons, but she is only a free action away from having something in hand. DROW ASSASSIN Assassins are some of the highest-paid individuals in drow cities. Always in great demand, they enjoy lives of plenty and comfort, selling their services to anyone who is willing to meet their price. Using poison, bolts, or blades, they get the job done—whatever it entails—with ruthless effi ciency. Most well-to-do drow keep an assassin or two on the payroll, even if they have no current targets, primarily to ensure that the killers do not betray them. DROW INQUISITOR In the tempestuous cities of the dark elves, traitors abound. It takes the keen eye of a skilled torturer to ferret out the plotters and conspirators, thus keeping a matriarch’s reign as secure as possible. Most drow inquisitors are females who Xil’etha the soulknife have some training in the priesthood of Lolth.

DROW PRIESTESS No group or organization wields more power in drow society than the clerics of Lolth. Drow priestesses are respected, or at least feared, by nearly all other drow. They act on the will of the Spider Queen, and occasionally on their own whim, always vying for more power and the favor of their goddess. They serve as battlefi eld commanders, constables, detectives, and judges, as the situation requires. DROW SLAVER The drow enslave other races as laborers. Raids supply the majority of prisoners, but more powerful captives have to be hunted down by skilled slavers. These tenacious trackers scour the subterranean tunnels and sometimes the surface world for marks that seem likely to fetch a high price. They rarely kill their quarry—that would just add the expense of a raise dead spell. Illus. by B.

On rare occasions, a warrior rises in the hierarchy to occupy a position of prestige. For the vast majority of these individu- als, life is short—usually sacrifi ced in battle for the greater glory of the race. FAVORED CONSORT Drow priestesses select consorts as lovers and mates. These males are breeders, serving to perpetuate the line and little more. Some priestesses indulge them, listening to their advice or opinions, but in most cases, a cleric uses a consort until she tires of him, at which point he is discarded. Although a consort has the favor of his priestess, it is his duty to protect her, even at the cost of his own life. He must be vigilant against assassins and traitors within the household, going so far as to taste her drinks and meals fi rst in case they have been poisoned. The sample favored consort presented here possesses a cloak of the consort (see page 103), which means he is likely a member of an important drow house and attached to a sig- nifi cant matriarch.

In fact, many of the landmarks were destroyed, most notably the Spire of the Encyclic, a storehouse of dark elf knowledge. The Ghetto of Scholars lacks the usual gamut of inns, taverns, brothels, and similar establishments. Residents here tend to focus on their various quests for knowledge. In the few taverns present, such as the Poison Pen and the Empty Tome, the ambience is sedate and intellectual. Quiet study, polite conver- sation, and the occasional game of skill is the rule, though the violence and perversity of drow society is never far beneath the sur- face.

If the PCs survive the dungeon, recover its treasures, and slay its horrors, their names become part of legend. Legendary dungeons are useful in two ways. First, they allow the history of the campaign world to directly affect game play. It is one thing to tell the PCs that a race of half-demon giants once ruled the world. It is quite another for them to come face to face the few remaining members of that race, hidden in their last fortress. Second, legends can foreshadow events planned for the current campaign. If the PCs hear rumors about a sacred forge hidden deep within Spirepeak, they feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment when they later fi nd a forge that matches the legend’s description—especially if the tale wrongly stated that it had been destroyed by demons. Perhaps the legend further says that only a sword crafted on the forge can slay the demon king Herazathal. Now the PCs face an interesting problem.

Once PCs establish a reputation, it becomes easier for them to attract like-minded allies and admiring followers. Cohorts arrive who wish to share in their adventures, as do apprentices eager to be trained by such legendary figures. Villains begin to consider the PCs’ possible actions when concocting their evil schemes. The player characters have left their mark and made a place for them- selves in the campaign world with their grand exploits. Introducing rewards such as noble titles, land grants, and a widely known reputation is a matter of knowing what motivates your players. These less tangible rewards only work if your players perceive them as valuable. Experience points are always valuable, and even exotic treasure types can usually be sold for cash, but being known as a Knight of the Red Tower is only worth something if your players regard it as valuable. Perhaps its value lies in access to noble patrons who wouldn’t previously give the characters the time of day. Maybe there’s a hierarchy of knightly orders that the charac- ters are determined to climb. Or maybe players just like it when NPC peasants bow and scrape in the presence of their characters. Consider the example of a vacant stronghold given to a PC by a grateful king. For one player, the grant of a small keep is a chance to create a base of operations and leave her mark on the commu- nity. Another player might just ignore the keep, content to enjoy an adventurers’ wandering lifestyle. And a third player might bring the game to a halt, worried that the keep will be destroyed if he leaves on another adventurer. Before you introduce other rewards, think carefully about how your players will react to them. While less tangible rewards require a little more work than tra- ditional treasure and experience awards, they can be powerful motivators to players precisely because they can’t be reduced to gp or XP. After all, we often say of a valuable thing that it’s “something that money can’t buy.” You may be surprised at the lengths players will go to acquire something they can’t buy, borrow, or steal any other way. BRINGING ADVENTURES TOGETHER Taking different adventures and tying them together makes a campaign. While creating a campaign is discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 5), below are some ideas for designing adventures that fit together. EPISODIC OR CONTINUING Episodic adventures are those that stand alone, with no relation to the one that came before or the one that follows. These adventures are fun, stand-alone scenarios that can be inserted anytime they’re needed or desired. They often provide interesting diversions from a continuing campaign. For example, in the middle of a series of adventures dealing with an evil prince, his minions, and the plague he unleashes on the land, the PCs might have a short episode dealing with recovering a lost lammasu cub. A continuing adventure has links that connect its compo- nents, each of them an individual adventure. A link may take the",
