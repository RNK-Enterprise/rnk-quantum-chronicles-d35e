Their pranks, jests, and insatiable demand for story and song are reminiscent to other races of a child’s short attention span and constant demand for enter- tainment. Those who make such hasty judgments, however, only show their ignorance of the gnome mind. Gnomes are a long-lived race. Adulthood does not come until forty-five years of age, and gnomes usually live to see at least 350 birthdays. In fact, it is not uncommon for a gnome to celebrate five hundred years of life, though few survive much past that age.

An apprentice is expected to pass a number of competency tests, depending on her area of study. For musicians, these tests would include the memo- rization and performance of a standard, comprehensive cata- log of music, as well as some original compositions. For painters, they would include paintings in various mediums and styles. For those focused on the written word, the tests would include composing competent works in a series of prose and poetical forms. Success in these exams allows the student to continue on to journeyman status, while failure means another year as an apprentice.
