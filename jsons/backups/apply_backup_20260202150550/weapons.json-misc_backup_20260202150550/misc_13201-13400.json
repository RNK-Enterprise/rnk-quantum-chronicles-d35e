Sample Encounter Stormcasters make excellent villains, for they are moti- vated by alien concerns and interests— though many people can see the power of the storm, few people are interested in getting close enough to examine it. A stormcaster can call down a storm on a village that hasn’t seen foul weather in several years, just to see if there is something inherent in the village that is protecting it or if it is just random chance—all the while remaining oblivious to the fact that people might be hurt. EL 15: Tamask Laryn is a powerful stormcaster who has studied the powers of the storm longer than many mages have been alive. Though his body is growing frail, his mind is sharp and inquisitive, if slightly unhinged.
