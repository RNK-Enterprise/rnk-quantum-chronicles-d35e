Although arrow demons are dangerous by themselves, they are at their most deadly when they can stand still and shoot every round.

In the skir- mishes and battles of mortal summoners, this means that the arrow demon is most effective when acting in concert with other summoned creatures or perhaps the mortal’s lesser minions. The very effectiveness of these obvious tactics have given arrow demons an importance in the ranks of the demons higher than their sheer physical power would otherwise earn them. Although an arrow demon must still give way to any greater demon, large groups of the abyssal archers know they are too valuable to their demonic lord’s battle plans to be gainsaid by any but the most powerful individual demons. Like other demons, arrow demons are cruel beyond mortal measure, knowing nothing of compassion or altruism.

GULGAR SOCIETY Gulgars live in tribes in and around the cliffs that yrthaks typically nest in.
