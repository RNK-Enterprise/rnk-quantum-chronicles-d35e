Thus this is a (relatively) safe route by which to weapons and other material support to the aquatic enter the caverns for those PCs lucky or persistent enough elves, tipping the balance of power in their favor. The to discover it, as well as a quick escape route for the hags sahuagin could not stand up to the combination of sea should they need it. elf armies with human merchant economic support. Their armies were defeated and their holdings fell. The elves expanded into the abandoned sea bottom, wrecking the sahuagin’s palace and homes. The ancient temple of Sekolah, however, was protected by powerful magic that kept the elves from destroying it as well. Its 190 8 RETPAHC ERUTNEVDA SELACOL priesthood fled, but the buildings and precinct remained. Elf patrols stood guard around the ancient site to prevent its evil from growing again. Now that the hostile sahuagin had been replaced by a friendly regime, the human traders were able to exploit the spice islands to the utmost. The elves had little inter- est in activities above the waves and were content to continue the trade in pearls and other undersea goods in exchange for food and exotic luxuries from the above-sea world. Both groups prospered for the next two centu- ries, while the remnants of the sahuagin tribe dispersed into small enclaves of raiders that posed no real threat to large fleets. The prince of the sahuagin had been killed in the war, but the high priestess of Sekolah escaped, along with a few acolytes. She swore that her people would one day reclaim the sacred place. This priestess, Naatrigitt, considered it her religious duty to keep the order alive. She established a retreat for training the most promis- ing candidates in the history and rituals of Sekolah’s worship. This temple-in-exile was a poor substitute for the glorious complex of old—a shabby, dark cave scooped out of a dead coral reef—but it was still the spiritual center for the scattered sahuagin exiles. Over the generations, each new high priestess took the name of Naatrigitt, leading the efforts to restore their people’s ancient greatness. As the centuries passed, the sahuagin slowly regrouped and plotted, while the high clerics of Sekolah kept alive the flame of hatred. But their numbers were far less than those of the now-thriv- ing elf kingdom, which enjoyed a population of many thousands and the continued support of the human traders. The sahuagin could only bide their time and wait for the right moment. That moment came a year ago, when a powerful sea- quake struck the Glittering Banks. The entire seamount subsided, burying sea-elf homes and killing thousands. In a moment, the elves’ most important source of food and trade goods was gone. The mighty kingdom had suddenly become an impoverished horde of starving refugees. The human traders provided some assistance, but they could not feed so many. The traders had also become complacent, seeing no need to support the elves as strongly as in the past, since they believed the sahuagin threat had long since vanished. The elf rulers could no longer control an extended empire—every able-bodied adult was needed to rebuild the capital and to search for food. Guarding the old sahuagin city, on the fringes of the elf kingdom, seemed quixotic in the circumstances. Over the next few months, the sea elves abandoned the site. It took a while for the sahuagin to realize what had happened. Their rangers and scouts had been watching the elves for generations but had never seen a sign of 191 LOCALES ADVENTURE CHAPTER 8 weakness.

Alternatively, the adventure site might be in a region previously uncharted by the dominant nations of your campaign, providing an opportunity to open up a new adventuring area. A simple way to introduce this adventure is to have the PCs be among a group of mercenaries who have been hired by the traders to deal with the emerging sahuagin problem. A more sea-oriented theme would be to have the PCs either be sea elves themselves or other aquatic peoples (aventi, darfellans, merfolk) coming to the aid of the elf kingdom, so that they are intimately involved in the outcome of the struggle. For a twist, have the PCs come in on the sahuagin’s side. After all, the sahuagin had been established there for centuries until the humans interfered, bringing them into conflict with the aquatic elves and costing them their city. It’s easy to change the tone of the set- ting by making the human merchants more grasping and manipulative and the elves more like pawns. Such an approach probably works best if the PCs are malenti The temple is protected by seas of blood Illus. by F. Hooper 192 8 RETPAHC ERUTNEVDA SELACOL camouflage.

The guards in this barracks are responsible for one of the floating platforms (area 26), as well as the guard post atop the tower’s roof. The guards’ assignments rotate periodi- cally, with each getting a day off every ten days. Every guard is outfitted with magic arms, armor, and equipment as appropriate to your game. Most have at least one level of wizard, allowing them to utilize wands or scrolls in defense of the tower. 5. Storage This area is used primarily for storage of miscellaneous household items. The owner might keep a secret chest of valuables hidden here, but most of that sort of stuff is bound to be up in the vault (14) on the second floor instead. 6. Barracks Much like area 4, ten tower guards occupy this cham- ber. The guards in this barracks are responsible for one of the floating platforms (area 27), as well as the guard post in the entry hall (area 1). 7. Bathroom The water for this fancy bathroom comes from an ever- ful basin. 8.

If the maid is in a good mood, she waits until the place is not scudding over a populated area. If she’s in a foul mood, look out below! 9. Armory Masterwork and magic weaponry and armor of all sorts fill this fancy armory. Enough weapons and armor is here for every guard, plus half again as many, just in case visitors or the other servants need to be pressed into service defending the tower. 10. Magic Laboratory This fancy magic laboratory is fully stocked with a vari- ety of arcane material components and focuses. A lab assistant works here.

In some cultures he is part of the warrior aristocracy. The details of the master samurai code are quite specific. Master samurai are required and expected to demonstrate absolute obedience to their feudal overlord, even if his lord’s commands might result in the master samurai’s certain death. He remains ready to die for his lord or his honor at a moment’s notice, and to avenge to the death any slight to either. His personal honor demands that he repay all debts fairly. Perhaps the most important tenet of this code is the expectation that the master samurai never commit a dishonorable act or demonstrate the slightest fear of personal injury or death. Master samurai who fail to live up to these strictures face personal shame so overwhelming that they prefer to destroy themselves rather than live under its shadow. Fighters, rangers, and paladins make excellent master samurai, and they find that its class abilities enhance their own combat potential. Monks also make good master samurai: The discipline of bushido is a natural reflection of the monk’s desire to study a philosophy or belief with single-minded determination. Wizards and sorcerers may find it difficult to qual- ify for master samurai, but those who do enjoy the martial enhancements available to them.",

Whether the adventurer finds herself in town or dungeon, forest or desert, the world and its various elements—people, monsters, buildings, geogra- phy, climate, religion, and customs—informs her choices and options, and affects her adventuring career, and those of her companions. The Fighter and the World Whether you play a fighter who plays the role of honorable knight-errant or callous mercenary, gallant cavalier or king of the highwaymen, the world in which you adventure and live has an impact on your choices and alternatives. A common stereotype dogs many fighter characters: The ordinary person whose only contri- bution to the party involves the abil- ity to swing a sword. While a sword 40 (or an axe, mace, or halberd) is unar- guably a fighter’s most obvious role during a game session, consider how W11829_620_00_Sword\u0026Fist 9/18/00 2:42 PM Page 41 CHAPTER 3:WORLDLY MATTERS Knights of the Watch (see page 47), or purchases entry into a large mercenary company. He might even demonstrate his worth to an individual of high station, such as a noble or a high priestess, and so be invited to join a retinue as a privileged bodyguard or special agent. Such circumstances often alter the fighter’s role within the adventuring party, because the fighter no longer exists solely for kicking in doors and bashing monsters. He now possesses responsibilities and commitments beyond those to his adventuring comrades, and this leads both to new adventuring opportunities and internal disputes for the party at large. Adventuring Roles Nearly every fighter who elects to pursue adventuring as a regular enterprise has the same role to play in their respective parties: They are the first to fight, whether eliminating opposing creatures or defending their comrades from attack. This should come as any surprise, for no other character class has better general fighting capabilities than the fighter. Below are a few brief ideas for fighters’ roles beyond just door-smasher and orc-basher. (For even more on PC backgrounds, see the Hero Builder’s Guidebook.)",

Pirates are the scourge of trade roar of the crowd and the public acclaim, or maybe you routes on the high seas, lakes, and even large rivers of do it for the money. Maybe you relish testing your the campaign world. strength and courage in a continual life-or-death struggle . . . or perhaps you are a slave, forced to fight for the amusement of others until you can find a way to win your freedom. Whatever the reason, you are a professional warrior who pits his body and his skills against a host of foes while others look on, cheering for your victory or your demise. Adventuring Role The gladiator exists in a society that places some value on public combat, whether purely for sport or as a means of disposing of unwanted individuals. The gladiator who joins an adventuring party often does so for one of two reasons. He is a free man who fights in the arena for money and fame, and who is thus able to do as he pleases in his free time. Otherwise, he could be an escaped gladiatorial slave. Regardless of his motivation, the gladiator’s role in the adven- turing party always remains fighting: He is usually in the forefront of any melee, and uses the skills and tricks he learned in the arena to contribute to his companions’ victory. Ability Scores As is true for most combatants who spend most of their time in melee, face-to-face and hand- to-hand with the enemy, good Dexterity and Consti- tution scores help ensure survival. Gladiatorial 54 combat often relies on dealing out punishment, even the battles are not to the death. As a result, a high Strength score helps the warrior put down his oppo- W11829_620_00_Sword\u0026Fist 9/18/00 2:44 PM Page 55 CHAPTER 4:THE GAME WITHIN THE GAME Adventuring Role Pirates are outlaws. They live by means that almost all civilized nations consider illegal, and they are moti- vated by a strong desire for personal freedom as often as they are motivated by greed. Hence, the pirate is a wanted and villainous criminal to some, and a free- dom-loving hero to others. Ability Scores You need to be strong and tough to survive the life of the seafaring buccaneer, so give priority to Strength and Constitution scores. Your Dexterity score also deserves attention, as wearing any heavy armor in this line of work tends to lead only to drowning. Skills and Feats Pirates are most at home aboard ship, so you want to select skills that give you the advantage when at sea.

However, employ- ing other strategies also works. • Attack with ranged weapons. Hit these opponents with arrows, bolts, spears, and spells from a distance. • Make use of feats such as Mobility, which grant you a bonus to your Armor Class when you are exposed to attacks of opportunity. You have a better chance of standing up to an opponent with reach if you minimize his advantage in this way. • Send in a character with Mobility anda good Armor Class, and while he is taking the heat from the enemy with reach, send another character around to flank (or better yet, sneak attack) the enemy with reach. • Take to the air any way you can and rain down attacks from overhead, remaining safely out of reach.
