Such a portal is called a vortex, and it usu- ally connects to an elemental or energy plane. In such cases, the conditions are similar on both sides of the portal. A vortex to the Elemental Plane of Fire might be found at the edge of a volcano, while one to the Elemen- tal Plane of Water could be found off the coast. The great- est dangers of such vortices are that native elemental life can cross over easily, and a traveler may suddenly find herself in another plane without intending to be there. Unlike a mundane doorway, it is usually impossible to step halfway across or reach through a portal. You are either on one side or the other. Reaching through a portal has no effect on the other side until you pass most of your body through—and then you’re on the other plane. “Just sticking your head in” won’t help you determining what is on the other side of an opaque portal, but divination spells such as analyze gateshould prove very useful. Spells do not pass through portals. Divinations do not reveal anything about the other side of the portal unless specifically noted by the spell. Divinations that target the 22 caster, such as see invisibility,do work across a portal. :2 RETPAHC GNITCENNOC SENALP EHT pqs",

From the edge of each controlled area, they gain control of an adjacent area, then move there, repeating the process as they make their way across the plane. A comforting method of travel is to allow gravity to pull one’s feet toward a chunk of earth (over which hovers an atmosphere of air) and walk upon it normally. Maps are useless in the chaotic expanse. Over time, even solid, permanent structures drift in the chaotic cur- rents of Limbo.

Most controllers are unable to achieve any works of complexity within the area they control. The best most can do is mix two or three elements—and not too subtly. Rare minds called anarchs can build objects of amazing complexity, including structures and even simple vegetation. Anarch ability is exceed- ingly rare even among Limbo’s inhabitants. It’s even less likely that visitors have anarch ability. pqs Familiarity Travel Time Very familiar 2d6 hours × Studied carefully 1d4 6 hours × Seen casually 1d4 10 hours × Viewed once 1d6 20 hours × Description only 1d10 50 hours Limbo Combat In a combat where all participants use the same direction of subjective gravity and stand on a solid surface, nothing differs from standard combat. However, those who know how to take advantage of subjective gravity can use it to make amazing leaps, to quickly fly away if threatened, and to run along floors or ceilings. An attacker who shoots or hurls a ranged weapon imparts subjective gravity to the ammunition. FEATURES OF LIMBO Limbo is filled with wonders beyond count, a few of which are briefly presented below.

But when the winds gust up, movement can be very difficult (see the Windstorms on Pandemonium sidebar). Pandemonium Combat Combat functions normally on Pandemonium, but in most cases takes place among strong winds. All ranged weapons suffer a –2 penalty on attacks due to the winds, and Tiny or smaller creatures must make a Fortitude save (DC 10) each round or be knocked down.

In general, gentler crea- tures live on Dothion, while wilder beasts and more savage creatures live across the gap on Shurrock. The primary deity of Bytopia is Garl Glittergold, deity of the gnomes.

His team of “able assistants” includes Baervan Wildwanderer, tender of the forest; Baravar Cloakshadow, master of illusion and deception; Flandal Steelskin, paragon of metalsmiths; Gaerdal Iron- hand, the gnomes’ battle general; Nebelun, muse of invention and discovery; Segojan Earthcaller, tiller of the soil; Callarduran Smoothhands, emissary to the deep gnomes; and Urdlen, known only as “the greedy.” Garl Glittergold’s divine cohorts make their home on Bytopia, in a region of Dothion known as the Golden Hills, although Callarduran is often visiting the deep gnomes on the Material Plane, and Urdlen claims part of the 399th level of the Abyss as his home. As a result of Garl Glittergold’s presence on this plane, most of Bytopia’s petitioners permanently assume the form of gnomes regardless of their race in mortal life.

Krigala The Beastlands’ top layer is Krigala, split in two by the River Oceanus. The river flows through the layer in a strong torrent, flanked by verdant forests that often bridge the great river with intertwined branches above. Small side channels depart from the river, and there are numerous bayous and oxbow lakes formed whenever this extraplanar river alters its banks. Krigala is a land of eternal afternoon. A warm sun basks the land in its continual glow. It is just warm enough in Krigala for the plant life of the area, and tem- peratures remain in a comfortable range unless manipu- lated by spells or divine will. Time passes normally but is not tracked by the moving of the sun. Instead, gentle rains drift in on soft breezes once per day.

They can also be wondrous palaces made of crystal and white marble with golden towers, as befits the deity of such a noble race. Corellon Larethian’s tower is the latter type. Festooned with colorful banners, it dominates the surrounding countryside. But only elves and Corellon’s allies are per- mitted through its doors to share in the song and feast. Corellon’s Court: Corellon has divided some of his duties as deity of the elves among members of his court. Sehanine Moonbow wields power over death and dreams, Hanali Celanil is the paragon of love and beauty, and Labelas Enoreth is the administrator of time. Aerdrie Faenya is the master of air and weather, Erevan Ilesere is behind much of the court’s mischief, and Fenmarel Mes- tarine is the ambassador to the wild elves. Finally, Deep Sashelas is the deity of the sea elves. Aquallor The second layer of Arborea is an eternal ocean. It is like the Elemental Plane of Water, and indeed there are vor- tices between the two. But unlike that Inner Plane, the layer of Aquallor has both a surface and a bottom. At its lower reaches, it’s as black as night. Aquallor is the home of Deep Sashelas, the deity of the sea elves. His realm is a construct of coral, gold, and marble veined with streaks of blue and green. The water around it is crystal blue and glows of its own volition.

Mark (Ex): At 1st level, the character can target, or mark, an individual humanoid foe. To do so, the blood- hound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to start the process again. Once this study is complete, that target is called a mark, and the bloodhound receives a variety of advantages against him or her (see below). A bloodhound may have up to one mark per two bloodhound levels (rounded up) at once, but only if all of them are within 30 feet of one another for the duration of the marking process. For example, a 6th-level bloodhound could mark three bugbears in such a group, but not a bugbear on one side of the kingdom and a troll on the other. If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending an existing one, the latter is unmarked, and the bloodhound loses XP equal to the amount he would have gotten for defeating that creature. The bloodhound can mark an individual once a week. No Subdual Penalty (Ex): Also at 1st level, the blood- hound can use a melee weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage instead without suffering the 50 usual –4 penalty on his attack roll.

This unfor- tunate knight has trespassed into the domain of the deepwood sniper, and he may not make it out alive. A deepwood sniper is patient, careful, quiet, and deadly accurate. She is a stealthy, long-range terminator whose arrows sail accurately from much longer ranges than those of other archers. In addition, she has magical abilities to help her shafts fly true. Because of their alertness, dexterity, patience, and affinity for the bow, elves of almost any character class make excellent deepwood snipers.

Greater wild shape works like wild shape, with the following excep- tions. As she rises in level, the shifter gains the ability to assume the forms of creatures with types other than animal (see Table 5–15 for details), though she cannot choose a form that normally has more Hit Dice than she herself does. She can designate at the time of the change which pieces of her equipment meld into her new form and which do not. Nonmelded equipment alters its size to match that of her new form, but retains its functional- ity. The shifter cannot, however, use any equipment unless she has either an appropriate appendage or a mag- ical means of compensating for the lack of one. Any piece of equipment that is separated from her reverts to its original form. At 1st level, the shifter is limited to humanoid forms of Small and Medium-size. Thereafter, she can use greater wild shape two more times per day for every two shifter levels she gains, and her range of available creature sizes and types increases as shown on Table 5–15. When she gains the ability to adopt an undead shape at 5th level, she may become incorporeal if she chooses the form of a creature with that subtype. If the shifter already has the wild shape ability from another class, she may convert her uses per day of wild shape to uses per day of greater wild shape on a one-for-one basis. She may also mix and match the benefits of the two abilities as desired to gain the maximum advantage for any daily use. Thus, a Drd8/ 69 shifter1 has up to four uses per day of greater wild shape, and she could use the ability to become a Large hu- manoid (because an 8th-level druid can become a Large CHAPTER 5: PRESTIGE CLASSES creature and a 1st-level shifter can adopt the form of a hu- manoid).
