This loan might be a reward for a task already completed, or a tool provided to accomplish a newly acquired quest. • The Sanctify Relic feat (see sidebar) allows a character to craft a relic for which he meets the requirements. While the prereq- uisite for this feat (any other item creation feat) is easy for any caster to meet, a DM could introduce story-based requirements or ramifi cations for a character who wants to craft such an item. Certainly, any local church dedicated to the same deity would take an interest in a character who suddenly appears with a shiny new relic. Creating Relics for Your Campaign The relics in this book are based on the deities of the core D\u0026D pantheon, but they don’t have to be. Moradin’s axe of ancestral virtue works just as well for any dwarven deity you create yourself—or any warlike but good deity, for that matter. If you create your own relic, price the base item—that is, the effect available to a character who doesn’t have the True Believer feat and chooses not to sacrifi ce a divine spell slot—just as you would any other magic item. The relic’s special power, however, should be virtually free—rather than assessing a gp cost, the “cost” to the character is the spell slot or feat required to unlock the power. The key is to balance the lost spell slot against the potency of the relic’s special power or powers. A relic that requires a charac- ter to sacrifi ce a 4th-level spell should provide a power roughly equivalent to (or maybe a little bit better than) a typical 4th-level spell. Such a power shouldn’t simply be a single daily use of another 4th-level spell—after all, the character could just have prepared that spell in the sacrifi ced spell slot. Instead, it should be something that the character couldn’t do with a spell slot of that level.

        "description":  "Magic Item Creation is the latest in Mongoose Publishing’s Encyclopaedia Arcane line, presenting a new look at one of the most critical components of any fantasy game, the magic item. Designed to be slotted seamlessly into any fantasy based d20 system, these sourcebooks enhance and expand every element of arcane magic, adding a whole new dimension to your campaigns. Each book of the Encyclopaedia Arcane line is not just intended for the Games Master to enhance his campaign, however. Players themselves will find full details on how to use the new magic systems with new or existing characters, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with in Core Rulebooks I and II. 22 INTRODUCTION The grand doors opened and the mousy acolyte stuck his head into the chamber. ‘It is nearly time, my lords. My master bids you attend him and plead thy case in hopes of earning his favour.’ Rogerio favoured the acolyte with his widest grin, his teeth, recently made perfect in the arcane salons of Tarak- Albay, glittered brightly in the candlelight. ‘We seek the favour of the one your master serves, unless you imply the archbishop has received some impressive promotion no one has seen fit to tell us about.’ The acolyte’s mouth dropped open and then snapped shut again. He fled away down the hall, stockinged feet whoosh, whoosh, whooshing like leaves flitting on cobblestones, hounded by Rogerio’s derisive laughter. Rogerio stood, brushed the dust from his silken finery and turned to Thorovald. ‘Ah, my friend. As always, your silence speaks less eloquently than you probably imagine.’ He laughed again, then sighed. ‘Come now, Thorvald, we do this for your benefit as much as mine. Say something. You speak so seldom that you had best practice when you are able. We do intend to seek the favour of a god, you will remember.’ Thorvald rose to his feet and stood, towering over the bard. ‘Fine. I will speak plainly with you, Rogerio, as banter is not in my nature. I like this not. I like this not at all. I have sacrificed too much in this quest already. The thought of pleading at the soft feet of toads does not sit easy with me. And make no mistake, the archbishop is a toad. I would do nearly anything to see this quest succeed but I do not think you should ask me to do this.’ Thorvald gripped Rogerio’s arm, his thick, gnarled fingers engulfing the smaller man’s upper arm entirely. ‘Do not ask me to do this. He has an ill-favoured look.’ Rogerio snorted. ‘If I mistrusted every man with an ill-favoured look, I’d naught be able to sleep in the same room with myself.’ He patted Thorvald’s hand reassuringly. ‘Our enemies already wish to send us to an early grave, no need to worry yourself into it for them. Come.’ ***** ‘Your words are as eloquent as the stories say,’ the acolyte said, as the archbishop nodded in the background, chins jiggling. ‘Truly, Rogerio, your reputation is well earned. Yet, it pains me to say my patron remains unmoved. The Father of All Winters will not help you in your fool’s quest. Of course, a substantial donation to the church’s coffers may serve to –’ ‘Enough!’ Thorvald’s shout echoed through the audience chamber. He strode forward, shoving aside the stunned acolyte and marching past the now pale archbishop. ‘I say, enough! Rogerio, do you not understand? When you seek the master’s favour, you do not whisper honeyed words into the ears of his dog.’ Leaping up onto the altar, Thorvald squelched a score of half-burned, tallow devotional candles beneath the heavy bulk of his boots. ‘Hear me, o’ Father of Winters! Here is the voice of one who seeks your favour, your patronage and your power! Here is the voice of Thorvald, son of Thorovask, son of Thorovalk, friend to Rogerio and his brother in all but blood. We are servants of snow, servants of winter! I come to you now hiding nothing, openly, without artifice and without feigned humbleness.’ Thorvald pulled his axe free of its bindings and waved it over his head, its blade slick and wet as ice. ‘We have slain in your name. We have torn down thrones in your name. We have built churches in your honour, we have built a nation and kept it free! I come to you here seeking only the means to serve you still more. You respect strength and we have it. You respect courage and we have shown it. Give us now your patron’s pledge and we will do more, we will make this world tremble! Give us the means to bring magic to our weapons and in exchange I offer this pledge. I offer...’ The archbishop began to laugh. ‘What, barbarian? What can one such as you hope to offer his magnificence?’ It was Rogerio who answered, whispering. ‘We can slay the Sun King.’ And thunder rocked the crystal columns as a voice like the arctic winds boomed in the audience hall… ‘LET IT BE DONE.’ 22 3 NEW ARMOUR, SHIELD AND WEAPON ABILITIES New Armour,",

Quirks take many forms, sometimes manifesting as actual magical effects and Quirks sometimes as unique physical properties which come about as a result of enchantment but are not in and of themselves magical. N ot all magic items are created the same. Quirks, both positive and negative, are separated into The vagaries of magic and the unique ways two categories, major and minor. The difference in which each caster manipulates magical between them is one of scale. A minor quirk is one energies ensure that, even amongst items which which is nothing more than a limited special effect, or are otherwise identical in their powers, there will a physical property which has no mechanical effects. be easily identifiable quirks which will make each A major quirk, while still not as powerful as an actual one unmistakable. Sometimes, these quirks will be item ability, is one which can have actual mechanical beneficial, giving the wielder access to a minor power, effects on the wielder or those around him. or perhaps increasing the item’s effectiveness in some particular situation, but it is equally likely that these Any permanent item (meaning one which is not a quirks will be detrimental, perhaps inflicting the owner single-use item, like a scroll) can have one or more with warts, or perhaps simply failing to work at random quirks. The exact number of quirks which can be intervals. embedded in an item is left up to the Games Master’s discretion but it is recommended that an item, This chapter introduces a new concept for magic items regardless of its power, be allowed no more than one in the form of quirks, minor magical effects which major positive and one major negative quirk, and no allow both Games Masters and Players to personalise more than two minor quirks. While minor quirks can the items they create, giving them unique attributes be selected in any combination (subject to Games which serve to both further differentiate items from Master approval, of course), a positive major quirk one another and make them more noteworthy. The must be accompanied by a major negative quirk and use of these quirks is, of course, entirely optional but vice versa. Under no circumstances should two quirks they will do much to spice up the magic items in your which directly counter one another’s effects be applied game without actually increasing or decreasing their to a single magic item. power. Creating New Quirks Note that no table for rolling random quirks is included with these optional rules. This Though the number of suggested quirks listed is intentional. While rolling randomly in this chapter is extensive enough to provide can be entertaining, it can too easily lead a good basis for most campaigns, there will to strange combinations of results which undoubtedly come a time when either a destroy the believability of a magic item, Player will come up with an idea or at least stretch it to the point where it for a quirk which is not on this becomes the butt of Player’s jokes; after list. Fortunately, creating your all, the ring of invisibility which is lucky own quirks is a simple matter.

Equally, a –1 common environmental condition, so long as it is penalty to Fortitude saves whilst using the magic item could be balanced by a +1 bonus to Reflex saves. Far from an Exact Science A +2 bonus can only be applied to a very specific group As you may have guessed, creating major and minor or rare environmental effect, but need not be balanced quirks is far from an exact science. To use quirks by an opposite effect (though it must still be balanced effectively, they must be balanced against the needs by a major negative quirk of some sort). Appropriate and realities of your campaign. In a campaign which examples of bonuses include, but are not limited to, a +2 features nothing but drow enemies, a +1 bonus to to attack rolls against female drow, a +2 to damage only strike drow is a major bonus which will simply not when fighting in arctic environments, or a +2 bonus to be balanced by a –1 penalty to strike goblins. In Bluff checks attempted within an open air market. such a situation, even a –1 penalty to damage rolls against drow may not be sufficient to counterbalance As a general rule of thumb, just remember – if it has it. To compensate, you might decide that the bonus a consistent mechanical effect, it is major quirk, if it can only be applied to drow who are from a specific does not, it is a minor quirk. city, or only against drow fighters, or you might simply outlaw the quirk altogether. Ultimately, as in Thematic Quirks all situations, the Games Master has the final say. Quirks work best when they are themed to each magic item, as themed quirks lend the item an aura of Not all Bonuses are Created Equal believable mystery which will add to your campaign As characters advance in levels, gaining more feats and keep campaign verisimilitude. Conversely, adding and abilities, certain penalties begin to lose some quirks which make no sense in the context of the item’s of their impact, with penalties to base damage power will strain suspension of disbelief and may lead perhaps chief among them.

Phantom Sound – Each time the item is activated, or for the duration of its use in the case of items with a Buttons Loosen – When you use the item, first activate continuous effect, a specific sound issues forth from it. or don it, or when you draw the item from its sheath This sound is roughly equal in volume to a low whisper (in the case of weapons), any buttons and clasps and can normally only be heard by the wielder and loosen. This can prove to be a bit of an embarrassing those who are in close physical contact with him. The annoyance. sound can be almost anything and is usually related to the powers of the item, so a monk’s belt which this Everclean – The item resists grime of all sorts, including blood. It need never be cleaned, as dirt and muck simply slides off it like water off oilskin. Extremities Swell – When you first activate the item’s powers, your hands and feet swell.

Font of Youth – When drawn, when worn, or when activated (depending on the type of item), your visage changes so that you look 10 years younger than your actual age. This has no mechanical effect. Frost/Flame – While the item’s powers are active, or while you wear it or hold it in hand (in the case of weapons, staves and the like), both the item and your body become coated with fingers of spectral frost or flame.

Light – The magic item radiates light while in use. The light is equivalent in brightness to a strong candle 1100 11 MAGIC ITEM QUIRKS Skin Tint – While the item’s powers are active, or while your wear it or hold it in hand (in the case of weapons, staves and the like), your skin takes on an unusual tint, perhaps turning red like a fire giant’s, or blue like a frost giant’s – the shade should be related to the powers or origin of the item. In any case, the tint fades one round after the item is no longer active or held in hand. Sneeze/Cough – When you use any item powers, or when you successfully strike an opponent in combat (if the item is a weapon) you involuntarily cough or lightly sneeze. Spectral Aura – While the item’s powers are active, or while you wear it or hold it in hand (in the case of weapons, staves and the like), the item is wreathed in a corona of spectral imagery. The aura is barely visible and can take any form, usually related to the powers or history of the magic item. So, for example, a sword crafted by a wizard obsessed with insects might be surrounded by buzzing, spectral flies, or be covered by an army of phantasmal ants. Static Electricity – Each time the item is activated, static electricity arcs through your body. While this has no mechanical effect, it does cause your hair to stand on end and will result in an unpleasant jolt should you quirk might continuously issue a low chant while the touch another being or conducting object. wearer is in combat and a cloak of etherealness might whisper with a sound akin to a spirit’s ghostly wail.

It returns or while you wear it or hold it in hand (in the case as soon as the item is no longer active, or is no longer of weapons, staves and the like), your body becomes in hand. This has no mechanical effects but can be covered with a light smattering of warts, scales, disconcerting, both for you and those around you. freckles, pimples or some other minor disfigurement. This disfigurement has no mechanical effect. Shivers – You feel an involuntary thrill of fear when you first activate the item. 1122 MAGIC ITEM QUIRKS Major Positive Quirks spell-like effects which are based on vision, smell or hearing, such as a medusa’s petrification ability.

Cavellan’s Gem of Great Insight The arch-wizard Cavellan was, in his lifetime, perhaps the most learned of all mortal scholars, a genius unparalleled in the fields of magical research and medicinal studies. In addition to his sharp mind, Cavellan was also famed for both his incredible age and his fussy obsession with neatness. Upon his death, his vast collection of magical knick knacks and bric-a-brac quickly began to circulate throughout both the adventuring and the scholarly community. His most favoured magical item, Cavellan’s gem of great insight quickly gained a reputation for both its usefulness and for its singularly unpleasant side- effects. 1166 17 NEW INTELLIGENT ITEM OPTIONS New items.
