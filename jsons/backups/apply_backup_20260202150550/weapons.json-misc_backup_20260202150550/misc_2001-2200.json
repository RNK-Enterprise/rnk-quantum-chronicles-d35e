Kingdoms and civilizations rise and fall, but the mountain still stands. To wear a mountain down takes eons, yet in time, another will rise to take its place. Like the mountains, you stand tall and strong, drawing your power from the earth beneath your feet. The first creatures of the world were created from the earth. In the D\u0026D pantheon, Moradin the Soul Forger crafted the first races from the living stone around his forge. Deities of earth are patient beings, willing to wait for millennia to see their goals fulfilled. Like those of other elements, they often have a neutral alignment com­ ponent. They are strong and deliberate and do not make up their minds quickly, but once they have come to a de­ cision, they are as endlessly stubborn as any stone. They are slow to anger, but once their ire is roused, their retri­ bution is as fierce and sudden as an earthquake. A church of an earth deity preaches that earth is the preeminent element, and that it is the source of all strength and all life. It carries the water, absorbs the wind, and is unharmed by fire. Such groups teach that the earth was the first creation brought forth from the void that preceded creation, and that it will exist long after the races of humans, elves, and even dwarves have passed from the world. The followers of earth deities also believe that complete peace comes only from emulating the soil and stone. Patience, solidity, and resilience Ki are valued highly in such organizations.

Many of the prestige classes associated with these groups, however, have requirements and benefits best suited to nondivine characters. The leaders of most religious organi­ zations realize that they cannot depend entirely on clerics or paladins to do all the work of their deities, so they\u0027ve found niches for characters of many classes and backgrounds. Some of the organizations described in the following sections sponsor one or more prestige classes. In such cases, the information common to all of them is presented with the organization description, and that pertaining only to a single prestige class is presented with that class\u0027s description in the Prestige Classes section beginning on page 80. These organizations resemble the affiliations described in Chapter 1 to some extent. They use a modified version of the organization format first introduced in Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide II. The benefits entry for each organization includes affiliation criteria and a list of ranks and titles like those of a church. (These effectively take the place of the benefits available to characters with the Favored in Guild feat. ) For more information about affiliations, affiliation criteria, and affiliation benefits, see Chapter 1.

To succeed as a Shadowspy, you must be entirely self-reliant. Unlike the shadowstrikers, you have no cell to fall back on for support, and you can\u0027t call upon the church for aid unless the circumstances are particularly dire. The self-reliance you have gained out of necessity might make you seem smug to others, but you prefer quiet confidence to vociferous bombast. Combat Fighting toe-to-toe is for shadowstrikers. You rarely enter combat unless it is on your own terms. Like so many of your enemies, you depend on the shadows to hide your movements and provide you with ample opportunities for ambush and evasion. Your assigned tasks rarely involve direct confrontation, though you are more than capable of defending yourself as long as the conflict is not protracted. You prefer, however, to strike quickly and from hiding, then slip away before your enemies can retaliate. Given the opportunity, you like to prepare an exit corridor by seeding it with snares, traps, and bolt holes from which you can launch ambushes. Doing so allows you to send groups of enemies scrambling in the wrong direction while you double back to make your escape. Sample Encounter Shadowspies are seldom seen unless they wish to be. Typically, they work alone or in pairs to investigate reports of evil acts in the cities and towns where temples of Pelor and Heironeous are located. Accomplished shadowspies travel far and wide in the name of Pelor, often infiltrating enemy nations for the purpose of divining the intentions of their leaders.

The default divine focus for any spell cast by a blighter is a desiccated sprig of holly or mistletoe. Any material com- ponent for a blighterÆs spell must have been dead for at least a day before use. Deforestation (Sp): A blighter can kill all nonsentient plant life within a radius of 20 feet per blighter level as a full-round action once per day. If a potentially affected plant is under the control of another (such as a druidÆs liveoak or a dryadÆs home tree), the controller can make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighterÆs Wis modifi er) to keep it alive. Affected plants immediately cease photosyn- thesis, root tapping, and all other methods of sustenance. Like picked fl owers, they appear vibrant for several hours, but within a day, they turn brown and wither. Except for plants selected by a controller, nothing can grow in a deforested area until it has a hallow spell cast upon it and it is reseeded. Deforestation enables a blighter to cast her daily allotment of spells. This ability works in any terrain, but deforesting a sandy desert, ice fl oe, or other environment with only sparse vegetation does not empower the character to cast spells.
