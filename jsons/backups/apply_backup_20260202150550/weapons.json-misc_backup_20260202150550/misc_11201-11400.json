HALF-ELVES AT WAR In general, half-elves see war as a necessary evil that should be confronted promptly in order to get it over with. A half-elf at war strives to combine human effi - ciency with elven grace. The result, embodied in a half-elf who is properly trained and equipped for war, is a combatant with an austere fi ghting style that wastes no movement and dispassionately dispatches foe after foe. Half-elves learn martial techniques and receive training in whatever military traditions are prominent in their home society. Elves are trained from an early age (relatively speaking) in how to handle a blade and a bow; most half- elves receive the same training. The techniques of the elves emphasize quick, darting moves, rapid swordplay, and hit-and-run tactics that take advantage of their keen senses, quickness, and reaction time.

Because their enemies are as determined to end their violent activities as the Scars are to continue them, the Scars remain constantly on the move and rotate their stronghold between several safe houses on a regular basis. The Scars are intimately familiar with Pal Ador’s exten- sive sewer system, which allows them to move undetected throughout most of the city. However, the age and labyrin- thine design of the sewers means that they are not very safe, and it is not uncommon for the Scars to fi nd monsters and patrols in the murky depths. The sewers are riddled with secret passageways, long-forgotten tunnels, and hidden strongholds of other underworld factions. The man responsible for raising the Scars to their cur- rent level of infamy is a shadowy half-elf named Mezriss. Raised on the unforgiving streets of Pal Ador, he quickly took to a life of crime and joined an ordinary criminal gang who called themselves the Scars. Mezriss assassinated the former leader through a slow, insidious contact poison hidden in a magnifi cent crown that he presented the leader “as a gift of respect.” Once he took over, Mezriss changed the scope and mission of the gang, turning it from a ragtag group of thieves to a highly effi cient band of assassins and criminals, bent on revenge for the inequality and humiliation they suffered for being half-humans. Over time, the inner cabal of the Scars was replaced solely with half-elves.
