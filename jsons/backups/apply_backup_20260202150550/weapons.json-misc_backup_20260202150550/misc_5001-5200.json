Silvarr has devoted the last forty years of his life to various schemes to keep his mortal existence intact. He loathes the prospect of undead eternity in lichdom, and having visited the Outer Planes, does not like what he’s seen of the afterlife. He would rather remain alive, in his present body, for as long as he can.
