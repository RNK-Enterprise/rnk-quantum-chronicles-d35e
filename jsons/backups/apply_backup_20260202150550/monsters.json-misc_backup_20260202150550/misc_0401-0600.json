You can also use this option to sneak up on someone from a hiding place. For every 5 feet of open space between you and the target, you take a –5 penalty on your Hide check. If your Hide check succeeds, your target doesn’t notice you until you attack or make some other attention-grabbing action. Such a target is treated as being ﬂat-footed with respect to you. For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue could attempt to dash across a 5-foot-wide doorway without revealing her presence to the orcs inside. Even though the open doorway provides no cover or concealment, she can attempt a Hide check as normal, opposed by the orcs’ Spot checks. She takes a –5 penalty on her check because of the distance involved. If she moved at more than half her speed, she would take an additional –5 or –10 penalty on the check depending on how fast she moved (see above).",

Glaring is a standard action that affects any creature Vorta can see within 100 feet. The target becomes shaken for 10 minutes and must attempt a DC 15 Will save or be stunned. The duration of the stun effect depends on the target ’s hit points, as described in the ﬁ endish glare ability above. Creatures with immunity to fear effects are immune to Vorta ’s ﬁ endish glare. Poison (Sp):  Once per day, Vorta can use poison  as an 8th- level caster (+5 melee touch; Fortitude DC 16 negates). Invocations Known (3 least, 1 lesser): least —dark one’s own luck, devil’s sight, miasmic cloud (DC 13), sickening blast  (DC 14); lesser —brimstone blast (DC 15).",

PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE Past the timeless eons that lie between the stars, pseudonatural creatures dwell beyond the planes as we know them, nestled in far realms of insan- ity. When summoned to the Material Plane, they often take on the form and abilities of familiar creatures, though they are more gruesome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. Alternatively, they might appear in a manner more consistent with their origins, manifesting as masses of writhing tentacles or other even more terrible-looking forms. SAMPLE PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE This ﬂ apping horror has a vaguely horse- like body with the forelegs and wings of a huge, foul bird. Grotesque pustules erupt from its ﬂ esh, ichor oozing from the vari- ous extrusions, and a long, serpentine tail thrashes behind the creature.

Lore of the Seekers: Seekers spread and believe in many different tales regarding the origin of the primal music. The one that has the most boisterous adherents (and sees the most rancorous debate) posits that some three thousand years past, an angelic being named Karoninwaithe brought the sounds of the primal music to Haeldriss Fey, an elf bard of great skill who devoted the rest of his days to spreading the primal music and seeking to more fully understand its power. Other sages (and even some seekers as well) claim that Karoninwaithe was actually a ﬁ end in disguise, and that the music that the seekers touch is actually a form of infernal power. Those who espouse this theory believe in the captivating nature of the music, and they point out how creatures once controlled by a powerful seeker are often driven to seek further exposure to the primal music.",
