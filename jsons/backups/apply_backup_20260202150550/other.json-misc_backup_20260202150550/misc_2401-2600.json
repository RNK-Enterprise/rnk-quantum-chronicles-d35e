Make a Diplomacy check as normal for inﬂ  uencing NPC attitudes, but add the group leader’s Diplomacy check modiﬁ  er to the DC needed to achieve the result. For example, to adjust the attitude of an unfriendly group led by an individual with a Diplomacy modiﬁ  er of +7 to friendly, you would need to roll a result of 32 or higher on your Diplomacy check (a base chance of 25, +7 for target’s Diplo- macy modiﬁ  er). If your check result is less than 12 (a base chance of less than 5, +7 for target’s Diplomacy modiﬁ  er), the target’s attitude worsens to hostile. The DC increases by 5 if the two parties are of different cultures or races.",
