Chezik could not repress a sob; he had loved this old coot like a father, despite the frightful experiences of learning the ways of the spirits. \u0027You have a visitor, Chezik,\u0027 his raven guardian croaked from the other side of the barrier between worlds. The young shaman turned around, and saw the most unlikely person to attend the shaman\u0027s funeral. \u0027Hello, Chezik,\u0027 Karil said, her voice husky and barely above a whisper. She was wearing a necklace made from bones, and the young shaman dared not think about where they came from. \u0027What are you doing here, Karil?\u0027 \u0027Telzun was as much my master as he was yours,\u0027 the young woman answered, reaching the top of the hill where the pyre was built. \u0027I knew his time was coming, so I travelled down here.\u0027 \u0027To mock his memory?\u0027 Chezik stood between his master and the wayward apprentice. \u0027To quell the funeral fires with your spit?\u0027 , \u0027Shut up.\u0027 Karil dropped the mask of civility. \u0027I hear the voices of the dead. They hold many, many secrets.\u0027 She walked pasthim andpulledasmallsack of herbs from her tunic. She gingerly put it between her old master\u0027s hands. Chezik did not stop her. \u0027The crazy old manmademanyenemies,onthis sideandacross.\u0027 She spoke without turning. \u0027Many will be waiting for him; they want his soul.\u0027 \u0027How do you...?\u0027 Chezik started to ask, but she put a finger on the young shaman\u0027s lips. \u0027I told you... 1hear the voices of the dead.\u0027 She pushed him back gently. \u0027Now help me set up the warding circle. 1did leavehim, butI neverabandonedall thathetaughtme.
