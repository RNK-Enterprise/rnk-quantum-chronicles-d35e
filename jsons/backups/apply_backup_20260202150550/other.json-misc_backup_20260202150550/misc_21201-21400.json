        "description":  "This book is built from the bones of giants. From the initial planar visions of Gary Gygax and Dave Sutherland, through Jeff Grubb’s original, almost-talmudic Manual of the Planes, with its contributions by Roger Moore and Ed Greenwood, to the vibrant Planescapework of David Cook, Colin McComb, Michele Carter, and Monte Cook, the planes have been an ever-evolving cosmology. Other resources for this work include the new Forgotten Realms®Campaign Settingby Ed Greenwood, Skip Williams, Sean K Reynolds, and Rob Heinsoo; Dragon®Magazine #272 \"The King and Queen of Dragons\" by Skip Williams; Guide to the Ethereal Planeby Bruce R. Cordell, Psionics Handbookby Bruce R. Cordell; Tangentsby Bruce R. Cordell; Tome and Bloodby Bruce R. Cordell and Skip Williams. Based on the original Dungeons \u0026 Dragons®rules created by E.
