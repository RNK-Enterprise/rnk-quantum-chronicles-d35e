Naratyr:Naratyr, called the City of the Dead, is a cold realm carved into the surface of a frozen ocean. Naratyr’s icy architecture is a frigid necropolis of tall mausoleums, towering funeral obelisks, crypt parapets, and carpets woven of hair removed from the thousands of unquiet dead that reside in Naratyr. The city’s warlike legions include retrievers, vampiric giants, and liches of all vari- eties. The rank and file of the population is mostly zom- bies, ghouls, wights, and other decaying corpses that move with a dark purpose. Who rules Naratyr? A good question. For time out of mind, a powerful demon lord named Orcus claimed the entire layer. However, Orcus was recently declared dead. A drow deity of vengeance and undeath claimed the victor’s spoils and assumed control of the layer and its crowning jewel, Naratyr. But now there are strong clues that Orcus is not quite as dead as many had thought. The drow deity has disappeared, and no one knows whether she fled or was slain. Could it be that Orcus once again rules icy Thanatos, one bony hand clutching his terrible rod? Other Abyssal Layers No tome could hope to catalogue the innumerable Abyssal layers.
