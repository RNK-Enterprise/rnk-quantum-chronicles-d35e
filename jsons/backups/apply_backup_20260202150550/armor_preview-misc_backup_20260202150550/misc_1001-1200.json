Chromatic andmetallic dragons are almost always too committed tophilosophical extremes to become clerics of Chronepsis,and their passionate adherence to their alignment meansthey have little interest in the detached attitude of thewatchers. Most dispassionate watchers are gem dragons,brown dragons, fang dragons, song dragons, dragon turtles,or wyverns. True to their name, dispassionate watchers of Chronep- sis remain aloof from the events of the world around them,taking the role of observers rather than active participants.They are excellent sources of information and advice, anddragons often appeal to them to judge disputes and com-plaints.

DRAGONHIDE ARMOR Armorsmiths can work with dragon hides to produce master-work armor or shields for the normal cost (see Special Mate-rials, page 283 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). The armor created has no special properties other than its masterworkquality . (An armorsmith who also has the Dragoncrafter featcan imbue even greater powers into the armor created; seeDragoncraft Items, below.)

A single hide can yield more than one set of armor if the armor is sized for creatures smaller than the size given onthe table. For each size category of the finished armorsmaller than the size given on the table, double the numberof sets of armor can be made. For instance, when making 115CHAPTER 3: THE PLAYER’S PERSPECTIVE116banded mail from the hide of a Colossal dragon, an armor- smith can make one suit of Huge armor (as the table indi-cates), two suits of Large armor, four suits of Mediumarmor, eight suits of Small armor, sixteen suits of Tinyarmor, thirty-two suits of Diminutive armor, or sixty-foursuits of Fine armor. Shield?: A “Yes” entry in this column indicates that enough hide is left over after the armorsmithing process to createone heavy or light shield or a buckler sized for a characterthe same size as the dragon. An armorsmith can choose tomake shields instead of armor out of all or part of a dragon’shide. Creating a tower shield uses up as much hide as a suitof hide armor.

He doesnot, however, gain any other benefit a character of thatclass would have gained (improved chance of controllingor rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats,and so on). This essentially means that he adds 1/2 hisplatinum knight level to the level of some other spellcast-ing class he has, then determines spells per day and casterlevel accordingly . If a character takes two or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receivethis spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in oneor more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receivethe spellcasting benefit for any level in the platinum knightclass that he has not already attained. For example, a 6th-level fighter/2nd-level platinum knight does not receivethe spellcasting benefit for being a 2nd-level platinumknight because he did not belong to a spellcasting classbefore taking 2nd level in the prestige class. If he thenpicks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to4th level in the platinum knight class, he receives the spell-casting benefit of a 4th-level platinum knight (when heattains that level) but does not receive the 2nd-level bene-fit retroactively . Platinum Scales (Ex): At 3rd level, a platinum knight’s skin takes on a slightly metallic sheen. He gains a +1 in-crease to his natural armor bonus. At 7th level, this increaseimproves to +2.

This effect stacks with the divine grace classfeature of paladins and similar abilities. Charisma Bonus (Ex): At 9th level, a platinum knight’s Charisma increases by 2 points. True Seeing (Su): At 10th level, a platinum knight gains the ability to see all things as they actually are. This ability isthe equivalent of the true seeing spell and lasts for 1 hour. A platinum knight may use true seeing once per day .TALON OF TIAMAT The talon of Tiamat furthers the goals of evil dragonkind.He takes particular delight in causing harm to metallic drag-ons and their allies. The talons of Tiamat welcome characters from any class or background, as long as they share a dedication to evil.Former fighters and barbarians rub shoulders with thosewho practice sorcery or divine magic.

Having survived to celebrate his 800th birth-day, he has slowed down and no longer seeks out conflict.Neither does he shy away from it, however, and many youngupstarts who assume his retreat is a sign of weakness havelearned the truth to their dismay . Keygrodekkerrhylon wants nothing more now than to be left alone, but his reputation for savagery draws a processionof those who seek glory and wealth by slaying the fearsomemonster.

For decades, hepreyed on salt caravans crossing his desert territory . Thepeople who operated the caravans and the mines that sup-plied them constantly sought to eliminate the dragon. Oneday, a group of adventurers hired by a mine owner locatedLothaenorixius’s lair and nearly succeeded in slaying him.Enraged, the dragon assaulted the mine itself, destroyingthe owners and taking over the entire mine. Lothaenorixius was quick to realize that the mine was a source of wealth. Rather than destroy it, he kept it in opera-tion. The dragon now spends his days and nights trying toextract the maximum profit from his mine. Lothaenorixius knows he must spend something on food and lodgings for his workers and draft animals, but in hisgreed he begrudges every copper spent. He constantly triesto produce the maximum profit for the minimum invest-ment. He makes extensive use of undead labor, but undeadcreatures do not work quickly enough to satisfy him. As aresult, he finds some living workers a necessity, especiallyfor transporting salt to market. Every three months, Lothaenorixius reviews production and income, then makes adjustments to his workforce. Thisusually entails killing and eating some workers (though healways saves some bodies for later animation as undead). Ifhe’s particularly displeased with the results, even his fol-lowers and cohorts feel his wrath. In spite of his management methods, Lothaenorixius tries to keep a low profile. He has circulated a tale of hisdefeat at the hands of the party who unsuccessfullyassaulted him in his lair. He runs the mine through hisspecial cohort Lilanab (currently his 8th, the previousseven having been slain as examples to the rest of theworkforce). Lilanab is an erinyes devil who masqueradesas a human and poses as the leader of the group that“killed” Lothaenorixius. Parties are more likely to encounter Lothaenorixius’s ser- vants that the dragon himself, unless they attack and lootthe mine. Lothaenorixius comes forth to defend his holdingif he perceives any threat. He also occasionally takes wingjust to feel and breathe the hot desert air, or to disrupt acompetitor’s trade. Lothaenorixius spends most of each day keeping tabs on business at the mine. He uses prying eyes spells and a crystal ball to monitor activities throughout the place. This surveil- lance usually gives him ample warning of any attempts toinvade his lair. Lothaenorixius usually tries to disguise himself before entering combat. He uses his veil ability to appear as some other big, flying creature. A gynosphinx or a brass dragonare two of his favorite guises. Lothaenorixius stays hidden in a vast, secret chamber in the salt mine he has taken over. The mine and the complexof buildings that support it are home to more than 300beings. These include Lilanab and more than 50 clericswith access to the Evil and Earth domains, dozens of mum-mies, and about 100 zombies. The remainder (around 150individuals) consists of overworked slaves of various kinds (mostly humans). Every resident with an Intelligencescore is aware that an unseen master controls the mine, butonly Lilanab and the clerics know their overlord is thegreat blue wyrm Lothaenorixius."

Whenunable to converse with a sapient creature, Mychasi happilyconverses with passing animals, or simply talks to himself.Adventurers can often get useful information about localevents from him, but only after engaging in an extendedchat in which the little dragon relates a seemingly endlessstream of superfluous details."

Beyond benign interest, how-ever, Urevhocymkearsus enjoys manipulating the thoughts,emotions, and actions of other creatures—through bothmagical and mundane means. He is particularly interestedin what makes creatures such as humanoids—beings notborn to evil the way evil dragons or demons are, choose evil.She has been known to tempt such creatures to commit evilacts in order to learn what motivates them to abandon whatthey believe is the right path.

Among nearby communities, legend holds that shewill answer any question put to her by someone whoclimbs the pillar to reach her, but she attacks anyone whoflies to the height. She has lost much of the love of conversation she had in her youth, mainly because she is tired of answering insipidquestions from idiots who happen to be strong enough toscale the pillar. She no longer couches unpleasant truths insoft language, instead being painfully blunt with advice andcriticism, in an attempt to bring any conversation to a hastyend. The only thing known to have brought her down fromher pillar-lair is the sight of a blue dragon entering her ter-ritory . Most blues know better."

She travelswidely now, visiting libraries, universities, and renownedsages and scholars of magic in order to increase her knowl-edge. Like all bronze dragons, she hates chaos and evil, buther greatest hatred is reserved for those who, as she puts it,pervert magic to the service of evil—particularly necro-mancers and evil conjurers."

Ugilanistorda Great Wyrm Copper Dragon Ugilanistorda is the laughing ruler of a quiet sylvan domainpopulated with all manner of fey . Like a faerie queen, shepresides over unceasing banquets in a quiet glen, sur-rounded by sprites and satyrs, nymphs and dryads, centaursand unicorns, wild elves and a handful of treants. She is soancient that she seems to be almost a part of the earth whereshe lies—rock and earth are embedded in her hide, andgrass and leaves sprout from her shoulders and tail. She andher assembly have little tolerance for intrusion: Creaturesthat enter her domain are usually trapped by the wild elvesand brought blindfolded before Ugilanistorda. She slayscreatures her pixies tell her are evil, and generally sendsaway good or neutral creatures unless they greatly impressor amuse her."

Natintrapa Young Gold Dragon For such a young dragon, Natintrapa has endured eventsthat granted her a depth of faith and wisdom coveted bydragons five times her age. Her parents were renownedchampions of Bahamut, instrumental in purging the earthof countless evil dragons. By the time they neared their twi-light, they had earned the unmitigated loathing of Tiamat,who finally took it upon herself to eliminate them when they threatened one of her greatest champions, sending anavatar to kill both great wyrms. Natintrapa was caught in thestruggle, and though both of her parents perished, she her-self was rescued—by none other than an avatar of Bahamut.Before leaving her, the Platinum Dragon bestowed his spe-cial blessing on her, and she has devoted her life to follow-ing in her parents’ footsteps."

Clytanmoorninyx Adult Gold Dragon An older gold dragon once told Clytanmoorninyx, “The fireruns too hot in your veins. Master it, or it masters you.” Sofar, Clytanmoorninyx has failed to master it. He is easilyangered by the slightest insult (and his impeccable sense ofgood manners makes him oversensitive to even minor vio-lations of etiquette), and he considers the existence of evilcreatures in the world a personal insult. Though he has beenknown to associate with royalty, offering counsel particu-larly in times of war, he chooses to spend most of his timein isolated wilderness regions, away from the intrigue andmachinations that so infuriate him."

Fuunharkaspirinon Very Old Gold Dragon “Fiends walk among us,” warns an old woman in simpleclothes. Fuunharkaspirinon should know, for she has dedi-cated herself to hunting and banishing or destroying infer-nal creatures who dare to insinuate themselves into humansociety and tempt mortals to evil. She has spent severalhuman lifetimes living among mortals—posing as an aris-tocrat, a scholar, a cleric, a soldier—searching for signs offiendish influence and tracking it to its source. She is cur-rently wrestling with persuasive evidence that someone hasmanaged to bring a Tarterian dragon (see page 189) to theMaterial Plane."

Kallionastiryne Adult Green Dragon Kallionastiryne regards every inch of the forest where hedwells as his domain, and he likewise regards anyone whosets foot inside without leave as a trespasser and vandal. Hisuncompromising defense of his forest has won him thegrudging admiration of a few druids; however, Kallionas-tiryne often grants orcs, giants, or other evil creatures hunt-ing and logging rights, demanding hefty bribes of gold andgems and plenty of flattery as well. Kallionastiryne is not so much worried about the welfare of his forest as he is aboutbeing recognized as its owner. Because he regards thesedeals as little more than temporary agreements with inferiorcreatures, they seldom last long."
