An oath owns its maker. These are so commonplace that few recognize their similarity to two simple statements express the fundamental principle of the pacts made by pact magic practitioners. pact magic. From this kernel, pact magic grows and branches, letting mortals draw from a wellspring of power that no OATHS TO IDEALS divine power can touch. Many characters make pacts with themselves. Such an unspoken promise can be as binding as any contract signed VESTIGES by a merchant—and far more effective at forcing a person A pact magic practitioner gains his power by bargaining to keep his word. For example, a druid who abandons her with entities called vestiges—the remnants of once-living allegiance to nature or adopts an extreme outlook must seek beings now trapped beyond life and death. Whether they forgiveness or remain forever divorced from her former were mortal souls strong enough to shatter the cage built by source of comfort and power. A monk who sets one foot off death, wayward outsiders too willful to cease existence, or the path to spiritual purity can never walk that path again. dead deities unable to lie quietly in their astral graves, vestiges Even barbarians, wild and inconstant as they are, must gird are the outcasts of the cosmos.

Since vestiges constantly hunger for any small taste of reality, PACT MAKING they always answer the call of any binders powerful enough Once a summoned vestige manifests, a binder must formally to draw them forth from the void. address it and request a pact. The general terms of the pact are always the same, no matter which vestige is summoned.

This contest might be played To call a vestige, a binder must know and be able to draw out by means of an argument, a staring match, a riddle posed its seal. In fact, anyone can draw a seal, but only someone to the binder, or in any number of other ways.
