Warehouse district PERSONA People often assume that Blackwall’s citizens are dour and grim, weighted down by a military life. This is true to an extent. Military service is mandatory for all who come of age in the city, though they are required to serve only a few years. Citizens do take their duties seriously and train hard, ready to defend Blackwall and Kaddas against any invader. In all other respects, Blackwall’s people are a cheer-ful, fun-loving folk. They welcome travelers who have proven themselves trustworthy. They shop at the bazaar for foreign goods, they laugh with delight at the antics of traveling entertainers, and they enjoy the camaraderie of a night with friends in a tavern. Crime in Blackwall is common, but it is made up mostly of petty, mild offenses that draw fines or short prison sentences. The infrequent violent criminal receives harsh punishment, almost always involving exile or execution. FOUR WINDS (THE TRADING HUB)",

Four Winds stands at the crossroads of two major highways that enable trade and travel between four great nations. The city exists for commerce, and it has grown to its current size as the literal center of its economic region. The city operates undr a tra-ditional, aristocratic government that is supported by all four of the nearby kingdoms, each of which is pleased to see the nobility in charge of so vital a mer-cantile center. Four Winds has a higher gp limit than most cities its size due to the constant inﬂ  ux of travelers and mer- chant caravans from all over the world. It frequently houses more than 8,000 travelers in addition to its usual population. Both an increased spending limit and a high transient population are common features of major trading cities. ARCHITECTURE The major structures of Four Winds are large and impressive, yet lack any single unifying style. The city’s architects are torn between the conﬂ  icting desires of impressing merchants and dignitaries from distant lands and avoiding the appearance of bias toward any one cul-ture. As a result, public buildings reach for a grandiosity they fail to attain, conveying a sense of pomposity without any real majesty. They appear to be based on descriptions of other great structures never actually seen by residents of the city. Unimportant buildings, such as small shops and the private homes of less prominent citizens, are simple, built of inexpensive wood. Most are plain and unadorned, but some feature gaudy decor in a feeble effort to appear more important than they are. LAYOUT Four Winds is surrounded by a single defensive wall, 20 feet tall and 10 feet thick. The wall is wide enough for guards to patrol and strong enough to withstand at least a brief siege (hardness 8, 450 hp, break DC 55). Yet a trading hub cannot afford to make access difficult, and the city has never needed to repulse invaders. Thus, vast gates pierce the wall at many points, including on each of the four main roads. Though they normally stand open day and night, the gates are solid and defensible, constructed of heavy wood (hardness 5, 20 hp, break DC 23). Each gate has a standing guard of two city watch soldiers (5th-level human warriors).  The city government spares no expense in road maintenance, even when cutting costs in other services. The cobblestone streets are built to accommodate feet, hooves, and wheels. The main roads are abnormally wide, allowing even the largest wagon to pass unhindered. Intersections have clearly marked street names, and most major thoroughfares are lit at night by lanterns or—in the richest portions of town—by continual ﬂ  ame  effects. The layout of the minor streets is a simple grid, so visi- tors can easily ﬁ  nd their way around. Smaller roads and alleys are hidden from the main roads behind buildings, ensuring that merchants are not inconvenienced by trash or beggars. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   12620_95386_Ch1.indd   12 8/21/06   4:43:50 PM8/21/06   4:43:50 PM13CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY 620_95386_Ch1.indd   13620_95386_Ch1.indd   13 8/21/06   4:43:59 PM8/21/06   4:43:59 PM14 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYFour Winds Map Key The keyed locations on the Four Winds map indicate various districts of the city.

Warehouse district PERSONA Ironically, Four Winds’ attempts to remain culturally neutral have produced a unique personality. Styles and fashions from nearby kingdoms and farther lands blend to create a riot of colors, garish to visitors but considered the height of taste by the inhabitants. Foods, music, games, and languages from the world over are equally mingled—Four Winds has a scent and an accent all its own. The people of Four Winds have an overdeveloped sense of their own importance to the region, but they try to hide that attitude from travelers. Citizens believe them- selves to be cosmopolitan and declare their tolerance of others, but they actually hold fairly provincial attitudes. They scoff at unfamiliar beliefs and often mock the dress and behavior of foreigners—but only out of earshot, since they want visitors to feel comfortable and thus be willing spend money in the city. This facade manifests as a sense of brittle politeness, a pseudo-friendliness that visitors notice. Merchants ﬂ  ock to Four Winds to trade—or at least to stop over on their journeys to other markets—but few foreigners stay long.  In order to make merchants feel safe and secure, the city government makes a show of rigidly enforcing the law. In truth, Four Winds has an exceptionally high crime rate, but so long as miscreants limit their activi-ties to picking pockets and other petty thefts, the guard grants them some latitude in the name of maintaining the peace. Should a foreign merchant be harmed or murdered, however, the guard turns Four Winds upside-down in the search for the perpetrator. DRAGONPORT (THE PORT CITY)",

Kaddastrei is the grand capital of Kaddas, the last remnant of an ancient empire and still a rich and power- ful nation. Many state capitals follow the models of military cities or trading hubs (as presented earlier), but Kaddastrei is a city built for no other purpose than to be its nation’s capital. Kaddastrei and Kaddas proper are currently ruled by King Rumeius IV. The monarchy of Kaddas is passed on to the oldest child in a commonly seen system of succes- sion; at the same time, custom demands that the ruler be versed in the arts of wizardry. Thus, Kaddastrei’s power center is both conventional and magical. ARCHITECTURE The ofﬁ  cial ediﬁ  ces of Kaddastrei are grand and tower- ing showcases, with sweeping arches and tall spires crowned by bright pennants. Though built primarily of granite, these structures bear white marble facades. The lower levels have bright windows of stained glass, while the upper stories are pierced by arrow slits. The palace itself is as large as a small village. It contains not only the king’s living and working quarters, but most of the city’s governmental ofﬁ  ces, an entire military garrison, and a magical laboratory used by King Rumeius and the other royal wizards. Nongovernment buildings, such as shops and private homes, are also of far nicer construction than in many other cities. Citizens keep their property clean, and many whitewash their houses. Even modest homes likely have at least two stories, with some boasting as many as four or five. As often seen in a military city, many of Kaddastrei’s roofs are flat. They can serve as archery platforms should the city ever face invasion, but they more often function as vantage points from which citizens can view the monarch and other nobles passing in procession. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   18620_95386_Ch1.indd   18 8/21/06   4:45:37 PM8/21/06   4:45:37 PM19CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY 620_95386_Ch1.indd   19620_95386_Ch1.indd   19 8/21/06   4:45:47 PM8/21/06   4:45:47 PM20 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYLAYOUT Kaddastrei is surrounded by a layered defensive wall rivaling that of any military stronghold, 32 feet in height and 15 feet thick. It has hardness 8, 1,170 hp, and a break DC of 70. The city’s gates are larger and more numerous than those in most fortified cities, the better to allow entry for royal or ambassadorial processions. Constructed of iron (hardness 10, 60 hp, break DC 28), each gate is normally open but guarded by six royal soldiers (5th-level human warriors). A second, smaller wall surrounds the palace, which sits atop a small rise. This wall is 10 feet high and 1 foot thick, constructed of stone (hardness 8, 180 hp, break DC 40). Each of its heavy wooden gates (hard-ness 5, 20 hp, break DC 23 ) is normally guarded by four royal soldiers. The main roads of the city form an off-center circular grid. Impossibly wide avenues stab straight from the palace to the many city gates, like beams from a sun, while perpendicular roads ring it in concentric circles. Smaller streets and alleys connect the larger ways like strands of a cobweb. No beggars haunt the main thoroughfares, and every building lining them is whitewashed and clean. These cobbled avenues are scrupulously maintained. In many places, arched bridges leap overhead, making the entire city feel like an enormous palace. The main avenues are lit by continual ﬂ  ame lampposts, all streets are clearly labeled, and major intersections boast per-manent guards.

Warehouse district PERSONA The people of Kaddastrei know the importance of their city, and they can be arrogant and pompous as a result. Visitors often find them tiresome. Nevertheless, the population is quite cosmopolitan. Citizens view other races, unusual cultures, and strange magic with tolerance, if not outright welcome. Crime in Kaddastrei falls under the purview of several accredited thieves guilds, all of which have standing arrangements with the city guard and with the crown. So long as they keep a tight leash on their mem- bers and avoid robbing or assaulting anyone important, the criminal guilds operate with minimal interference. While many in power dislike this arrangement, they recognize that the alternative would be a larger number of independent, unrestricted criminals. The guilds enforce the protection of individuals designated as off limits and eliminate competition by outside thieves, performing both functions far more efficiently than the city watch could manage. This situation perpetu-ates a belief, at least among the capital’s wealthy, that this “ultimate city” is practically free of crime, while it alienates the poor who suffer the depredations of the guilds.

When expansion began in earnest, the tribes invited skilled builders from neighboring dwarf and human communities to help plan and produce a true city in the mountain. In exchange, the foreign workers were allowed to stay and live in peace among the grateful residents. The dwarves’ knack for construction, coupled with the humans’ sense of style and efﬁ  ciency, turned Cliffside into a fascinating example of unusual urban design. Cliffside’s ofﬁ  cial government is a council of druids, harking back to the halﬂ  ings’ forebears, but their rule doesn’t go unchallenged. An inﬂ  uential cult exists within the city, dedicated to an ancient sea deity—a goddess said to have shaped Cliffside’s original caves with the power of wind and rain. Some followers of this cult cooperate with the dominant faiths, merely encouraging the occa- sional bit of “tribute to the sea” (which accomplishes their goals without insulting anyone’s beliefs). Other folowers campaign for a return to living sacriﬁ  ce to appease the sea deity, lest she return and send destruction against the now developed city. ARCHITECTURE Cliffside is unusual in that most of its foundation was laid by nature. Millennia of seasonal storms blowing in from the ocean eroded vast openings in the moun- 620_95386_Ch1.indd   21620_95386_Ch1.indd   21 8/21/06   4:46:23 PM8/21/06   4:46:23 PM22 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYtainside, resulting in something resembling a massive insect hive fashioned of stone. Most structures are primarily carved from the native rock, working artiﬁ  cial elements smoothly into the natural. Builders take care to strengthen the sides of the buildings that directly face the water, reinforcing the existing stone with treated wood, magic, or both. The locals have a natural facility with wood, which grows in abundance on the top of the cliff. Only at the highest elevations, where the wealthy and powerful dwell, do structures use more attractive or more delicate substances. LAYOUT Cliffside features several main “roads,” with a number of crisscrossing “side streets.” In a city in which each struc- ture is at a slightly different elevation from every other one, creating traditional thoroughfares is a challenge. The original residents used ropes and natural ledges to get around, and crossing from one side of the city to the other required a fair bit of climbing. The city’s engineers later decided to build upon this system rather than discard it entirely; the result more resembles a network of suspension bridges than a customary street layout. This network of so-called bridgeways connects all the major neighborhoods to a large area of ﬂ  at ground about halfway up the mountainside. This open space is the closest thing Cliffside has to a town square, and many of the major businesses and markets are located there or nearby. The remainder of the city, particularly the poorer neighborhoods farther down the mountain, is more like a hive. Business zones are the easiest to reach and navigate, with private residences taking up outlying areas of town. Visitors who arrive by sea face quite a climb, whether they seek supplies or wish to consult with city luminar- ies. Most of the city’s important locations are at least midway up the cliff. Strangers in Cliffside are encour- aged to stick to the safest areas of the city, including the central plaza and the strongest bridgeways leading to it. Cliffside Map Key The keyed locations on the Cliffside map indicate vari-ous districts of the city. For a general discussion of these features, see City Districts beginning on page 34. 1.

Warehouse district PERSONA Despite its unique foundation, Cliffside remains a halﬂ  ing community at heart, and it still feels like one. Daily life here is precarious, yet the locals ﬁ  nd the time to offer up a pleasant smile or cheerful greeting even to total strangers. Because of their origins and beliefs, the halﬂ  ings of Cliffside aren’t as innately good-hearted as some of their more pastoral cousins, but neither are they evil as a group. Living in such an environment requires absolute harmony with its perilous nature. Despite prog- ress and solid engineering, Cliffside still sees a number of injuries and deaths from falling or drowning every year. Proximity to potential disaster and loss has given the people a hard edge, but it hasn’t stripped them of their compassion. C l i f f s i d e  i s  l a r g e l y  b e r e f t  o f  c r i m e ,  u n l i k e  o t h e r  coastal cities. The easygoing nature of its inhabitants, coupled with the magical power of its ruling body, discourages unpleasant behavior. As usual, though, this condition holds less true in the poorest sections of town, where many residents don’t have the wealth or skill even to secure their homes with doors. The city does maintain a watch (which reports directly to the druid council), but since it is composed primarily of humans, it focuses on protecting other humans rather than the halfling locals. Poor residents are left to fend for themselves, which not only encourages crime but fosters resentment toward both the watch and the ruling elite. Cities by Culture All the above example cities assume a human-dominated culture. If this is not the case in your campaign, you might wish to modify your city descriptions to better ﬁ  t a dominant nonhuman outlook. DWARF CITIES Other than humans, dwarves are the most proliﬁ  c city- builders among the common humanoid races. Dwarves work with stone, pure and simple. Wood is for burning, 620_95386_Ch1.indd   22620_95386_Ch1.indd   22 8/21/06   4:46:46 PM8/21/06   4:46:46 PM23CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYfor buttressing tunnels to prevent cave-ins, or to provide a framework for heavier materials. The traditional image of the underground dwarf com- plex is roughly accurate, but it represents only one method of construction. Dwarves who build underground carve entire cities out of the rock: rooms, hallways, massive chambers, even wide-open spaces such as town squares and temples. Where they can, dwarves build within and around preexisting caves. Some underground cities consist of simple rooms shaped from the exist- ing space, while others are true buildings—complete with walls, roofs, and windows—erected within enor-mous caverns. Surface-dwelling dwarves also prefer to build in stone, recreating the earthen womb from which their race hails. These surface cities are usually well defended, built within isolated valleys or surrounded by walls so thick that they contain rooms themselves. Buildings have heavy doors and relatively few windows, giving them an even greater sense of weight. In either case, dwarves prefer to build vertically rather than horizontally, a practice dating from a time when their race was restricted to cramped underground cav- erns. A dwarf city takes advantage of natural elevation, so that squat-looking buildings actually rise several stories. In some cases, one level of the city shares a single ceil-ing, which also serves as the ﬂ  oor for a second layer of buildings above. For more on dwarf culture and communities, see Races of Stone . ELF CITIES Elves build their cities in conjunction with nature, rather than in opposition to it. This attitude doesn’t mean that every community consists of tree houses, as some smaller elf villages do, but rather that buildings incorporate their surroundings into their construction. The long-lived elves can afford to slowly shape and grow their environment as they desire. Many elven buildings use living trees as support columns, or leave room for trees to grow through floors and ceilings. Tree branches might be woven together to form bridges between city districts. Some structures have no constructed floor on the ground level, instead retaining the existing soil with living grass. In communities where magic is commonplace, elves might use spells to shape nonliving materials such as quartz into buildings. Magic can also form living trees into habitable structures. Many communities Elves build their cities in conjunction with nature, rather than in conﬂ  ict with itIllus. by J. Hodgson 620_95386_Ch1.indd   23620_95386_Ch1.indd   23 8/21/06   4:46:55 PM8/21/06   4:46:55 PM24 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYhave running water and sewer systems; rather than using pipes and pumps, they employ magically created ch ann e ls t o an d fro m n earb y ri v e rs, o r e v e n create/ destroy water  spells. Elf cities are always constructed near sources of fresh water and always have some means of defense. Examples are a surrounding wall of trees to serve as archery platforms, and a city built atop a high rise. For more on elf culture and communities, see  Races of the Wild . GNOME CITIES Gnomes often build underground, but their communities are quite different from those of dwarves. They rarely build complex structures, but simply carve comfortable homes out of the rock. Their cities remain near the surface, for ease of farming and gardening—some are not subterranean at all. Surface-dwelling gnomes build simple homes from wood, stone, or whatever materials are handy. Humans are often surprised by how much gnome buildings resemble their own (allowing for the difference in scale, of course).  Gnomes do not overplan their cities, expanding them as the need arises rather than conforming to a prear- ranged layout. Their cities are lightly defended, if at all. Gnomes prefer escape routes and ambush points over fortifications. For more on gnome communities, see Races of Stone .HALFLING CITIES Halﬂ  ings rarely build their own cities. Many are nomadic, and those who choose to settle usually establish small settlements or live amid human cities. The rare halﬂ  ing town that grows large enough to qualify as a city is little more than a jumble of wooden structures. Half-ling cities grow from and into their environment, in much the same way as Cliffside ( see page 20). Half-lings do not build solely around natural elements as elves do, but they work the natural surroundings into their buildings’ features. Halfling homes are often adorned with colorful plants, or roofed in thatch and heavy leaves. Many are open to the outside, with large windows or even entire missing walls, using sheets of canvas for protection against storms. Like elves, halflings prefer to build near natural water sources and fertile soil. For more on halﬂ  ing communities, see Races of the Wild . ORC AND GOBLINOID CITIES While a few exceptions exist (notably hobgoblins), orcs and the various goblinoids have primitive cul- tures, which are reflected in their cities. A typical city consists primarily of rough wooden buildings, with",

Hagan 620_95386_Ch1.indd   24620_95386_Ch1.indd   24 8/21/06   4:47:12 PM8/21/06   4:47:12 PM25CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYfew taller than two or three stories. Construction is crude: Doors might not fit well in their frames, or might be merely hide curtains, while roofs are often thatch or simple wood. Roads are rarely paved and follow no real plan. Most such communities have some sort of defensive perimeter, such as a wooden wall, a spiked moat, or a series of guard towers on stilts or built in trees. Many orc and goblinoid cities are subterranean and use stone rather than wood, but they otherwise resemble surface cities. They exploit defensible locales, rich natural resources, or nearby communities on which to prey. Underground cities are more oriented toward defense, often being built in caverns with limited entrances. Such cities are crudely functional, with little thought for aesthetics. Decoration is minimal: trophies from prior kills, or walls daubed with bright colors, with little sculpture or artwork. Other races assume that these primitive humanoids have no interest in beauty. Although this is true to an extent, the main factor is that orcs and goblinoids expect their communities—even the larger cities—to be temporary. They constantly struggle with other races, other tribes of their own kind, and marauding adventurers. Thus, they view any effort beyond providing the necessities of life as a waste of time and energy. PLANAR CITIES Some campaigns take characters far from familiar lands, even their own planes of existence. Cities on other planes have alien appearances. Variable laws of gravity and magic present unusual architectural and engineering challenges, at least from the human perspective. The ultimate example is Sigil, the City of Doors. Here on the hub of the Concordant Domain of the Outlands, reality bends over itself: Anywhere within the city, one can look up into the sky and see the same city. Like elves, the builders and inhabitants of planar cities are extremely long-lived, and their urban centers reﬂ  ect an awareness of history and of the passage of time. At the same time, a planar city embodies a sense of eternity—it always has been and always will be as it is today. A city’s cultural outlook depends on its place in the multiverse. Cities of the Outer Planes reflect the character of the area’s native inhabitants. For example, the portal town of Ribcage in the Outlands, which borders the Nine Hells of Baator, is inhabited by fiends and petitioners of that plane. For more on planar communities, see Manual of the Planes .Unusual Locations Where a city stands affects it just as much as how it was built or who occupies it. Presented here are examples of interesting locations for cities, ranging from the mun-dane but atypical to the truly fantastic. COASTAL Not every city built on the coast is a major trading center like Dragonport (see page 14). Some grow from nearby industry or depend on local, land-based trade. Even so, such a city’s daily life and economy depend on the ocean in some way. Fishing is a common livelihood, and the local diet includes not only ﬁ  sh and crustaceans, but also seaweed and other aquatic plants.  Coast-dwellers must be ever alert for the spears of sahuagin or the tentacles of kraken, to say nothing of mundane dangers such as pirates. Because of these hazards, the defenses of a coastal city must include naval forces as well as standard infantry. This situation can actu- ally make the city more vulnerable than its landlocked counterparts, because it cannot devote all its defense to an attack from only land or sea. The climate of a coastal city tends to be temperate: Winds and currents from the ocean keep it cooler in summer and milder in winter than areas farther i n l a n d .  H o w e v e r ,  i t  i s  v u l n e r a b l e  t o  o c e a n  s t o r m s ,  floods, and tidal waves, any of which can swamp an entire community. Wise city-builders make use of water breaks and levees, or place structures on higher coastal elevations. Wealthy cities might use magical defenses, such as various permanent wall spells designed to protect against approaching water, or weather-controlling magic to prevent great storms from spawning nearby. CLIFF FACE Unlike Cliffside, which grew out from a group of sea side caves, these cities are built into sheer cliffs. Some real-life civilizations have constructed cliff-face dwellings, but in a fantasy setting such communities are usually the homes of avian races such as the raptorans, from Races of the Wild , or the aarakocra of the F ORGOTTEN REALMS ® campaign setting.  Traditional humanoid races might also build such cities, though, for a number of reasons. The location is eminently defensible, forcing attackers to rappel down or scale the cliff face, all the while vul- nerable to archers and magical attack. Even if an enemy reaches the structures, no more than a few attackers can enter at a time. Only with magic or flying troops does an army have any chance of taking a cliff-face 620_95386_Ch1.indd   25620_95386_Ch1.indd   25 8/21/06   4:47:26 PM8/21/06   4:47:26 PM26 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYcity. The city’s altitude puts it above the level of most ﬂ oods, and makes inhabitants vulnerable only to storms moving in from a speciﬁ  c direction. Not every cliff is appropriate for city-building. One must have caves to serve as homes, or at least allow for easy excavation. The dwellings must be interconnected within the cliff, or the inhabitants must build stairs or ladders on external ledges. Ledges are more vulnerable to weather and attack, but cities with ledged cliff faces are more numerous than those without. Cliff-face communities face economic challenges. Goods must be lowered from or raised to the level of the caves, requiring great feats of magic or engineer-ing. Crops are usually grown at the foot of the cliff or atop the vertical face. As a result, such cities are vulnerable to shortages (both naturally occurring and as the result of a siege); many of these communities keep stockpiles of emergency supplies deep within the caves. DIVIDED CITIES A divided city might span opposite banks of a river, spill over the top of a cliff into the valley below, or spread across a chain of tiny islands. Whatever its situation, physical, political, and social division has a major effect on the city’s development. People think of themselves as residents of their district ﬁ  rst, and then of the city as a whole. Crime rates, fashions, architecture, and decoration might be homogenous throughout the city, or they might vary so much by district that different sections feel totally distinct. A divided city might develop for any number of reasons. If the soil is more fertile across the river, or the area more defensible from a vantage point on the mountainside, the population might naturally expand in that direction. Alternatively, two neighboring commu- nities might grow into a single city, despite geographic obstacles. A city might also deliberately encompass a particular resource or holy site. Nor is such a city limited to two sections: A fork in a river might split a city in three, a mountainside town might have half a dozen districts at different elevations, and an archi- pelago city could feature dozens of tiny, independent neighborhoods. Even if no one section of the city is intended to be richer or more important than the others, its citizens will tend to liv e where they f eel most comfortable.  Invariably, one part of a divided city becomes more popular than the others, leading to resentment among the residents of other sectors. In mixed-race cities, the dominant race might occupy the bulk of one highly desirable section, leading to tension with the less privi-leged inhabitants. This tension is exacerbated when one section of the city actually is more important than the others. A city built both in a valley and atop a nearby rise can defend only the higher location, to where all the valley-dwellers must evacuate in case of an attack. A city that spans a raging river likely receives more traders and travelers on one side than the other, making the favored section wealthier and more cosmopolitan. In any city of this type, the section with the clear advantage attracts the richest and most influential dwellers, deepening the social and political divide between the districts. ISLAND CITIES Even in a low-magic setting, the island city is a perfectly realistic concept. The city’s role and inﬂ  uence depend upon the island’s location, inhabitants, and power center. For example, a metropolis might develop on an island in the middle of an ocean separating two great continents. Such a location would support a city that is both port and trading hub, vital to communication between the land masses. In settings where magic is more pervasive, a ﬂ  oating ocean city needn’t be on an island at all. The Atlantis model is a classic fantasy trope: an ancient city built by mysterious, advanced peoples that has been recently discovered. Whether it has arisen from centuries beneath the waves, or drifted in from unknown waters, such a ﬂ  oating city provides a ready-made context for exploration. On the other hand, if the city has been continuously inhabited for centuries or even millennia, its unique situation will have affected the outlook and social structure of its dwellers. Other interesting situations could produce a ﬂ  oating city. Consider a Brigadoon -esque scenario, in which the settlement (with or without its original inhabitants) lies under an ancient curse, suddenly appearing or disappear- ing in an unexpected location. Ironically, one of the biggest concerns of any island or ﬂ oating city is water. Seawater is not potable, and even Small humanoids need around 2 pints of water per day to survive, so residents need some source of fresh water. In tropical climates, they might ﬁ  ll cisterns with plentiful rainfall or have access to inland streams. Otherwise, the city requires a method of desalination, whether techno-logical or magical. SKY CITIES Another classic element of fantasy is the city in the clouds. Many of the features and challenges of island cities are likewise present in sky cities, though such locales tend to exist only in high-magic settings. In 620_95386_Ch1.indd   26620_95386_Ch1.indd   26 8/21/06   4:47:35 PM8/21/06   4:47:35 PM27CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY addition to other concerns, the residents of any aerial city must consider gravity. Stepping off the edge of an island will usually only result in wetness; stepping off or through a cloud can be downright fatal. Are citizens protected by a persistent magical effect, or do all of them have some way to ﬂ  y? Another factor to consider is whether the sky city is mobile. Some such cities move around, either through the will of their residents or an outside force. Perhaps the city’s long-gone creators built in a propulsion mechanism, or the city simply drifts with the winds. A mobile city raises new concerns that affect environ- mental and social factors, especially its interactions with other communities whose space it enters. Mun-dane concerns such as the supply of food and water, or waste disposal, also can have unusual solutions in a city that doesn’t stay put. Like other isolated areas, sky cities often have difficulty trading with others. Ev en wh en air tra v el is relativ ely common, such as  in the Eberron setting, making the trip to and from a cloud city is not trivial. Sky cities have their advantages, though, especially with regard to defense. Being a mile in the air and (if the city is mobile) being able to move away from danger makes such a city difﬁ  cult to capture without an armada of airships or hordes of ﬂ  ying troops. UNDERGROUND CITIES Nothing embodies the flavor of the D UNGEONS  \u0026 DRAGONS  game as much as the underground civiliza- tion. Within many D\u0026D campaigns, subterranean cities are hardly unusual. Still, building beneath the earth presents a special set of design constraints to city engineers. Underground cities are inexorably linked to the races that inhabit them, the sun-hating drow being the best known example. Surface-dwelling races might also build cities underground for various reasons. A cataclys- mic event, such as an unending storm or a destructive meteor shower, might force a community belowground. Alternatively, explorers might have discovered a valu- able subterranean resource, such as a massive lake with potable water and plentiful ﬁ  sh, and moved into the cave to exploit the ﬁ  nd. Adequate light, food, and air are the primary needs of an underground city. Unless the inhabitants possess darkvision, they need some form of illumination, and (assuming they are living creatures) they need to eat and breathe. Underground cities face fewer challenges to trade than those in other unusual locations. They also can attack and be attacked more easily, producing classic conﬂ  ict situations between surface-dwellers and those who live beneath them. Almorhabbi, a cloud cityIllus. by B.

Each city has its own traits and quirks. Different combinations of the following features make every city and its districts distinctive. LIGHTING A city’s or district’s general prosperity tends to correlate to its lighting at night. The worse the illumination, the poorer the area, and the higher the local crime rate. None:  The poorest cities and neighborhoods do not bother lighting their streets at all. Those who go out at night must bring their own light sources, or trust to the moons and stars. Torches:  Cities that can afford no better ill uminate their streets with simple torches on posts. Torches burn quickly and require frequent replacement, so most such cities light only their most important thoroughfares.",

Traditional defenses take the form of fences, walls, moats, and similar obstacles. In a fantasy setting, however, these measures are less effective than they were historically. A moat can stop an advancing army, but a dragon or a wizard can ﬂ  y right over it. A wall might be high enough to impede a 6-foot-tall human, but what about a 26-foot-tall giant? Nonetheless, such features remain the most common forms of city defense—something, after all, is better than nothing.  In most walls stronger than simple wood fences, the gates are equivalent to either strong wooden doors or iron doors ( DMG  60), depending on construction. Treat gates in a fence as good wooden doors. In all cases given below, hit points are per 10-foot section of wall.

Barriers cre- ated with wall of iron  and wall of stone  differ only slightly from standard walls—and the expense of surrounding a city with such magical constructions would be sub-stantial. Instead, some communities hire spellcasters to respond to breaches in a wall during battle: A spell patches the hole far more swiftly than mundane workers could manage. The most effective magical barrier might be a per-manent wall of force  combined with a dimensional lock effect, which can withstand almost any sort of attack. But casting enough of these spells to protect an entire city is prohibitively expensive. Only the very wealthiest cities, or those ruled by arcane practitio- ners powerful enough to do the job themselves, could even consider using such methods. A slightly more common practice, though still an expensive one, is to protect only important structures or districts with pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsHAZARDS OF POOR SANITATION Bad sanitation is not only unsightly but also unhealthy. Anyone unaccustomed to the stench must make a Fortitude save upon first entering an area of bad sanitation. On a suc-cess, the character is sickened for 2d4 minutes. Failure results in the character being nauseated for 2d4 minutes and sickened for the next 24 hours. A new save is required every 24 hours, but the DC drops by 1 each day following the first. Once the save DC drops below the character’s normal Fortitude save bonus, she is no longer susceptible. The risk of disease is pervasive in such areas. Anyone in the affected area who takes more points of damage in 1 round than his current Constitution score (not modifier) must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or contract filth fever (DMG 292). 620_95386_Ch1.indd   30620_95386_Ch1.indd   30 8/21/06   4:48:26 PM8/21/06   4:48:26 PM31CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITYsuch spells. In this case, mundane defenses protect the bulk of the city. Moat:  Most people think of moats as surrounding individual castles, but one can also encircle an entire city. A moat need be nothing more than a deep ditch, but it could be ﬁ  lled with water, spikes, or more horriﬁ  c substances such as acid or poisonous thorns. Treat such barriers as pit traps, water obstacles, or heavy rubble, depending on the contents. The sides of moats are steep slopes ( DMG  89). SPECIAL FEATURES A given city might have interesting or unique features not encompassed by the previous categories. Below are a few examples, both mundane and mystical. Feel free to augment these with ideas of your own, drawn from both historical and fantasy inspirations. Aqueducts:  Some advanced cities use systems of aqueducts to channel water from distant lakes and rivers. Stone pipelines and tunnels with a gradual slope direct water toward the city and into cisterns or the sewers. A fantasy city might instead use a magic portal  to a nearby lake, or even a small gate  connecting to the Elemental Plane of Water. (The latter requires guards or magical defenses against potentially hostile creatures that might arrive along with the water.) Bathhouses:  Many large cities feature communal baths, sprawling complexes of plain stone or marble where people can relax and socialize. Some contain nothing more than hot- and cold-water pools. Others are complete recreational facilities, with wine rooms, restaurants, barbers, exercise areas, and other ame-nities. Unlike most other luxuries, the baths are usually available to all citizens, though the wealthy and powerful might have access to nicer facilities. Generally, only cities with running water can have bathhouses. Canals:  A network of canals running through a city can facilitate transportation and trade, form a sewage and drainage system, or separate city districts. The canals might also be home to strange creatures, which could be allies or enemies of the city’s people. Communication and News:  How do the people of the city learn what’s going on their world? In some areas, people pick up rumors where they can, and travel- ers are the best source of news. Some cities employ a town crier, a person who walks the streets shouting about recent major events. Even without mass print-ing, simple broadsheets in the marketplace might announce upcoming events. In a high-magic setting, the city authority might project illusory images at a fixed time and place each day to inform the citizens of the latest news. Institutions:  A sizable or important city likely includes noteworthy institutions, such a wizards’ college, a major library, or a great cathedral. The institutions you include in a city affect the resources available to the citizenry (and the PCs) in a variety of ways. Interior Walls:  Some cities isolate their districts from one another with walls or gates. The presence and nature of such barriers reflect the attitudes of the city government and its upper classes, or might warn of a high crime rate (and the two factors might be connected). Monstrous Inhabitants:  Does the city welcome unusual citizens? If the dominant culture is human, does it allow giants in the army, or bugbears in the city watch? Different cities have varying levels of tolerance for monstrous inhabitants. Some might welcome unusual humanoids but nothing more exotic, while a truly fantastic metropolis might have a mind ﬂ  ayer politician or an undead district. Public Transportation:  Does the city provide some means for citizens to travel from one place to another? Depending on the context and the availability of pow-erful magic, such a service can range from carriages or rickshaws for hire to a publicly maintained system of teleportation spells. For example, in the E BERRON  setting, the city of Sharn has ﬂ  ying carriages to take citizens to its various towers.",

        "description":  "Much of a city’s wildlife feeds on garbage or dwells in the sewers, exposing the creatures to disease. Any feral animal encountered in a city has a base 10% chance of being a disease carrier. If the city has only drainage ditches to deal with waste, this chance increases to 20%; if the city has no waste disposal system at all, it rises to 40%. If an animal is a carrier, anyone it injures is susceptible to ﬁ  lth fever (Fortitude DC 12 negates). This save is in addition to any that might be required due to unsanitary conditions. Potholes:  Even on well-kept roads, cobblestones occasionally crack, or packed earth sinks, forming potentially hazardous potholes. A small pothole (1 foot or less in diameter ) requires a successful DC 15 Spot check to notice. Any creature moving on land across an undetected small pothole must succeed on a DC 10 Reﬂ  ex save or fall prone, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A small pothole does not harm a wagon or carriage, but the Concentration DC to cast spells while moving over it increases by 5. Large potholes (2 to 3 feet in diameter) are easier to detect, requiring only a DC 10 Spot check. Any creature moving on land across an undetected large pothole must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or fall prone, taking 2 points of Dexterity damage and a –5 penalty on any land-based movement rate, due to leg injury. The driver of a carriage or wagon that moves into a large pothole must succeed on a DC 15 Handle Animal or Profession (teamster) check. On a failure, the vehicle’s wheels and axles are damaged, requiring 1d20 hours and the appro-priate Craft skill to repair. Sinkholes:  Due to hollows in the earth or erosion from heavy rains, sections of land might collapse entirely. A slow sinkhole is comparable to quicksand ( DMG  88), while a sudden sinkhole is treated as a 20-foot-deep (or even deeper) pit trap that cannot be reset. MAGICAL HAZARDS The prevalence of magic in a fantasy city produces unnatural dangers unique to that environment. Alchemical Fog: Alchemical and magical experi- mentation and item creation frequently involve burning and boiling various substances. On dry, windless days, the fumes released by these processes accumulate in pockets of alchemical fog. A fog might cover only a single building or city block, or it might spread across entire districts.  A creature that enters an alchemical fog must attempt a DC 12 Fortitude save, with an additional save every 24 hours spent within the fog. Success means no physical impairment other than an annoying cough. On a failure, t h e  c r e a t u r e  i s  s i c k e n e d  f o r  2 4  h o u r s .  I f  a  c r e a t u r e  i s  sickened by the fog for a number of consecutive days equal to its Constitution modiﬁ  er (minimum 1), it takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage each consecutive day it remains sickened. An alchemical fog can last for days or, rarely, weeks or months. Roll 1d10: On a result of 1–9, the fog remains for that many days. On a result of 10, roll again and add that result to 10. (Continue rerolling as long as the die keeps coming up 10.) The fog’s duration also depends on if the weather remains dry and calm. Should a strong wind arise or a storm blow in, the fog dissipates regardless of the predetermined duration. Alchemical Rain:  Sometimes the fumes that create an alchemical fog rise into the upper atmosphere, result- ing in alchemical rain. The ﬁ  rst rain after an alchemical fog is dispersed is usually an alchemical rain, but such a phenomenon can occur without warning.  The dissolved substances in alchemical rain are highly caustic: An y creature or object caught in an  alchemical rain takes 1 point of damage per round on a cumulative basis—1 point of damage in the first round, 2 points in the second, 3 points in the third, and so forth. Thus, a lengthy alchemical rain can eventually damage even objects that have reasonably high hardness. Alchemical rains are usually brief, but sometimes can last for several minutes. Roll 1d10: On a result of 1–9, the rain falls for that many rounds. On a result of 10, roll again and add that result to 10. (Continue rerolling as long as the die keeps coming up 10.) Arcane Pollution (CR 5):  Arcane pollution is a rare phenomenon that occurs in and near wizards’ colleges and arcane laboratories. In a 60-foot radius around a central point, the atmosphere is tainted by magi-cal residue and the effluvia of arcane experiments, 620_95386_Ch1.indd   32620_95386_Ch1.indd   32 8/21/06   4:48:42 PM8/21/06   4:48:42 PM33CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY producing random spell effects. A creature entering an area of arcane pollution must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid its effects. On a failure, roll 1d20 and consult the following table; the creature is targeted by the listed effect. Arcane Pollution Effects d20 Spell Effect * 1   Baleful polymorph (up to Small animal or Small vermin only) 2–3 Gain spell resistance 14 for 4d20 minutes 4–6 Change to random color for 4d20 minutes 7–9 Confusion 10–11 Deep slumber 12 Targeted dispel magic 13 Displacement 14 Enervation 15 Enlarge person 16 Haste 17 Hold person 18 Reduce person 19 Slow 20 Teleport (1d10 miles, random direction) * If a spell effect requires a saving throw, the DC is 13 + spell level. Each spell has a default caster level of 10th. An antimagic field  s u p p r e s s e s  t h e  e f f e c t  o f  a r c a n e pollution. Arcane pollution can be destroyed with a suc- cessful dispel magic  check (DC 10 + the level of the spell effect). Unless the pollution is suppressed or destroyed, it remains in place permanently. Black Mold (CR 4): Black mold is an insidious sub- stance that can produce citywide epidemics without any readily apparent source. Black mold can appear anywhere within 1 mile of a major source of magical energy or alchemical fumes—in other words, almost anywhere in a city. This mold usually grows in 5-foot-square patches. It favors corners and shadowy areas, requiring a successful DC 15 Search or Spot check to detect. Living creatures within 30 feet of black mold must succeed on a DC 1 4 Fortitude save or contract mindﬁ  re (DMG  292). They must repeat this save for every 24 hours of exposure, even if the ﬁ  rst save was successful. Physical contact with black mold deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage as well as requiring a save to avoid the disease. Direct sunlight renders black mold dormant. Fire and remove disease destroy it. Necrotic Miasma (CR 3+):  Sometimes a city’s magical residue combines with the psychic anguish of the victims of violent crimes. This necrotic miasma lingers in an alleyway or building, causing the area or structure itself to consume life energy. Such locations are often the source of local haunting tales, because undead tend to congregate there.Arcane pollution comes in many varieties—and baleful polymorph is one of the worstIllus. by E. Widermann 620_95386_Ch1.indd   33620_95386_Ch1.indd   33 8/21/06   4:48:50 PM8/21/06   4:48:50 PM34 CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF THE CITY  A living creature takes 1d6 points of damage every round when it is inside a building or an area tainted by necrotic miasma. A successful DC 12 Fortitude save halves this damage; this save must be repeated in each round that exposure continues. Damage can manifest as a feeling of weakness and pain, or wounds might open on the subject’s ﬂ  esh. This is a necromantic death effect, and is thwarted by death ward  and similar protec- tions. Undead in the area beneﬁ  t as from the effect of a desecrate  spell. A consecrate  spell suppresses the effect of necrotic miasma, and hallow  removes the hazard entirely. Nothing else works; even if an affected structure is destroyed, the necrotic miasma still lingers in the area.City Districts Most cities are divided into districts. The decision to create districts might occur during the planning stages of a city, with an eye to accommodating specific s t r u c t u r e s  a n d  f u n c t i o n s .  I n  m a n y  c a s e s ,  d i s t r i c t s  grow from habit: The wealthy favor the area with the best views and greatest security, while tanners and butchers and alchemists end up far downwind of the general populace. A district might be a single neighborhood or city block, or it might encompass a large area. Districts have their own purposes or identities. Some contain similar types of buildings, such as a waterfront or shop district. Others, such as a lord’s keep or a garrison, are single buildings or complexes with large numbers of residents and staff. A district can contain as few as several dozen people, or pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsBUILDING AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS The entries in this section make frequent references to concepts such as “fine lodging” or “exotic trade.” Examples and defini-tions of each are provided here.",

This estate might be a single mas-sive house or a complex of buildings. It contains the living quarters of the city’s ruler, offices and meeting chambers, and often a parade ground or ceremonial gathering place for public addresses. The lord’s keep is also often, though not always, the location of the city’s highest court. Citizens with no official business are usually turned away unless they are invited or come as petitioners. The estate grounds are meticulously kept and usually feature large gardens, luxurious fountains, hedge mazes, and the like. People are clad in the latest fashions, and carriages are as common as pedestrians. The air smells relatively fresh here. In most cases, the lord’s estate has not only its own defenses but also an independent source of water, enabling it to withstand a short siege even if the city should fall.

These numbers assume that about 40% of a city’s ready cash is concentrated in the upper-class districts, though these represent only 10–18% of its total districts. About 50% of the city’s assets are in its middle-class districts, and the remaining 10% are in its lower-class districts.Asset Multiplier by Social Class —— Asset Multiplier in: ——Social Class Small City Large City MetropolisUpper 4,000 7,500 16,000Middle 1,500 3,500 9,000Lower 150 350 800 Most cities are made up primarily of lower-class districts, though in larger cities, the upper class increases while the lower class shrinks, as shown on the table below.

A city heavily engaged in trade would have a larger middle class than one that is mostly isolated and self-sufficient.  Generally, districts of the same social class adjoin each other. In some cases, one or two adjacent districts have a social class one step higher or lower than the others. Very rarely, upper-class and lower-class districts exist side by side. In such cases, they are separated by some geographical or artificial feature, such as a small cliff, a river, or a wall. 620_95386_Ch1.indd   46620_95386_Ch1.indd   46 8/21/06   4:50:51 PM8/21/06   4:50:51 PM47CHAPTER 1 THE SCOPE OF",

Alternatively, characters might be petrified or subjected to multiple negative levels. In such a case, it’s off to the temple for assistance. The information in this sidebar is designed to help you, as the DM, make a trip to the healer into a roleplaying experience. To run a trip to the healer, first check the NPC Healer Prices table for the basic expense. Then choose options for the temple and the healer and, if you wish, select an extenuating circum-stance to make the service less expensive for the PCs.  You can generate a healer randomly if you wish by rolling d% and consulting the tables below, or you can just pick whatever options you like. A sample healer’s class and level are just sug-gestions; feel free to adapt them to your city. Sample Temples d% Details01–30  Dominant Temple: This massive edifice is one of the best-known landmarks in the city—in a theocracy, it might be the center of government. PCs who seek healing magic must first speak to one or more temple bureaucrats before they get an audience with a healer who can help them. 31–50  Minor Temple: This temple has some local prominence, but it’s ﬁ  guratively (and sometimes literally) in the shadows of larger, more popular temples. PCs can usually see a healer right away, expecially if they arrive injured or carrying corpses. 51–65  Clandestine Sect: These worshipers keep to themselves either because their deity demands secrecy or because they have the enmity of another power in the city. Their temples are often disguised as other sorts of buildings or hidden by secret doors or illusion magic. 66–80  Forgotten Shrine: The healer is devoted to a deity or cause that few venerate anymore. Such shrines are often in out-of-the-way parts of the city or even beyond its walls. 81–100  Wandering Missionary: This healer regards every street corner and marketplace as a potential spot for worship and sermonizing. The PCs might find the healer in the bazaar one day, in the slums another day, and just outside the city gates on a third day.NPC Healer Prices MinimumMalady Spell Class/Level Base CostDeath  Raise dead Cleric 9  5,450 gp Incomplete  Resurrection Cleric 13  10,910 gp corpse  No corpse  True resurrection Cleric 17  26,530 gp Energy drain Restoration Cleric 7,  380 gp paladin 14 Negative levels  Greater  Cleric 13 3,410 gp restoration Ability damage Restoration Cleric 7,  380 gp or drain  paladin 14 Curse  Break  Bard 10, 450 gp enchantment  cleric 9, (doesn’t always  paladin 14, work) sorcerer 10, wizard 9 Remove curse Bard 7, cleric 5, 280 gp paladin 11, sorcerer 8, wizard 7 Disease  Remove disease Cleric 5,  280 gp druid 5, ranger 11 Petrification  Break  Bard 10, 450 gp enchantment  cleric 9, (doesn’t always  paladin 14, work) sorcerer 10, wizard 9 Stone to flesh Sorcerer 12,  660 gp wizard 11 620_95386_Ch2.indd   62620_95386_Ch2.indd   62 8/22/06   9:14:16 AM8/22/06   9:14:16 AM63CHAPTER 2 THE URBAN ADVENTURERmovement horizontally in this fashion (so long as the wall is wide enough ), even if that distance, plus your falling distance, exceeds your normal movement rate.

Greater Invocation Devil’s Whispers:  As sugges- tion, plus subject believes his actions were his own idea.INVOCATION DESCRIPTIONS These new invocations are intended for use by warlocks (see Complete Arcane ) who spend substantial time in an urban environment. COCOON OF REFUSE Least; 1st You cause various bits of trash and detritus in an area—loose wood, rot- ting garbage, old clothes, discarded dishes, scraps of parchment, even dead animals—to fly about and latch onto a single target creature. If the target fails a Reflex save, he is entangled . The subject can escape with a successful DC 20 Strength or Escape Artist check, which can be repeated in every round as a standard action. The invocation ends when the target successfully escapes, or after 1 round per caster level. This invocation requires that at least 50% of the refuse be urban trash, so it does not function in the wilderness. Creatures of Huge or larger size are immune to this invocation.DEVIL’S WHISPERS Greater; 5th You can use a suggestion  effect, as the spell. Additionally, when the d ura ti o n  e n d s  o r  th e  tas k  is  co m -pleted, the subject must attempt a second Will save with a –5 penalty. If this second save fails, the subject completely forgets that you were the one who suggested the course of action mandated by the use of devil’s whispers , instead becoming convinced that it was his own idea—even if he’s not certain why he might have chosen to perform such an action. A successful break enchantment  spell can rid him of this delusion, but dispel magic  and similar effects cannot. You can have a number of devil’s whispers active at any one time equal to your Charisma modiﬁ  er (minimum 1). Devil’s whispers  is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. THIEVES’ BANE Lesser; 3rd So named for the people who most commonly suffer its effects, this invocation allows you to make a deadly trap of an ordinary door. You can produce a hold portal  effect, as the spell. In addition, should anyone other than you open the ensorceled portal from the outside by any means (including knock  or dispel magic spells) before the spell’s duration expires, the portal (or a large por- tion thereof) instantly explodes outward, dealing 5d6 points of damage to all within 20 feet of the door on that side. Creatures standing on the inside of the door are unaffected. Each creature but the one that trig- gered the effect (assuming it was standing in front of the door) can attempt a Reﬂ  ex save for half damage. Spell resistance does not apply to the damage caused by this effect. Thieves’ bane turns a door into a trapIllus. by C.

Whether their power is political, financial, criminal, or social, these groups can make valuable allies—or potent enemies—to enterprising adventurers. When used to their fullest extent, they can shape the course of an entire campaign. City Government The most important (or at least the most fundamental) “faction” at work in most cities is the local government. R e g a r d l e s s  o f  i t s  s o u r c e  o r  s t ru c t u r e ,  t h e  g o v e r n m e n t forms the context in which all other systems—from guilds to churches to private organizations—must function. In some cases, the government moderates the growth and influence of such groups, ensuring that no one private entity ever outshines the rest. In other instances (particularly regimes where corruption runs high) the government is a merely a means to an end for these special interests—or worse, an insigniﬁ  cant factor in their daily operations, lacking either the power or motivation to curb their inﬂ  uence.POLITICAL SYSTEMS Two comparable cities, each of similar size, population, and demographic distribution, might still feel very dif- ferent from one another if their governments operate differently. What follows is a look at how the average city runs under each of the most common forms of government in a fantasy world. (For more on the default political systems, see DMG  140.) THE AUTOCRATIC CITY Since the monarchy is the most common politi-cal structure in a fantasy setting, the autocratic city is the most commonly encountered type of urban center (with the possible exception of the feudal city, below). Cities under a monarchy tend to reinforce the principles behind their ruler, including the centralization of power, the importance of noble birth, and the endorse- ment of the rich–poor divide. Members of the working class do their best to muddle through their daily routines, with the occasional appeal to the local ruler (or their neighborhood repre- sentative, if one exists) to improve their lot in life. The gentry, on the other hand, try to balance their pride and dignity with taking whatever 69Illus. by D. BirchamIllus. by D. Bircham 620_95386_Ch3.indd   69620_95386_Ch3.indd   69 8/22/06   9:19:00 AM8/22/06   9:19:00 AM70 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERscraps of power the throne sees ﬁ  t to offer them. In an autocratic city, only the local ruler and those whom he favors know lives of luxury. Regardless of how man y branches and ag encies do the day-to-day work of making the city function, the autocratic city is ultimately ruled by a single individual. If the city is the capital of a nation or an empire, that i n d i v i d u a l  c o u l d  w e l l  b e  t h e  k i n g / q u e e n  o r  o t h e r  national regent; few rulers care to delegate authority within their own demesnes. In cities outside the capital, the local monarch is likely a governor, appointed by or on behalf of the national monarch. A ruler might well maintain his share of aides, including chamberlains, chancellors, and even a parliamentary council, but at the end of the day, he is indisputably in charge. In good- and neutral-aligned cities, the governor typically rules by virtue of noble blood (whether deserving or not) and does his best to keep the people content, even if all that effort involves is distracting them from their complaints. In evil cities, the governor rules by possess- ing the might and inﬂ  uence to retain control, with the power—either appointed or assumed—to crush those who resist his decrees. THE DEMOCRATIC CITY If the autocratic city is the most common type of fan-tasy metropolis, then the democratic city is the rarest. D e m o c r a t i c  c i t i e s  t a k e  a  g r e a t  d e a l  o f  k n o w - h o w  a n d  cooperation in order to function, and many end up col-lapsing under their own weight. (Whatever else might be said of autocracies, they can certainly sustain them-selves, especially in a medieval setting.) Cities making a go of true democracy buzz constantly with activity, as people run to and fro to keep the wheels turning. Few individuals live lives of indulgence in a democracy, but just as few go hungry. A  d e m o c r a t i c  c i t y  d i f f e r e n t i a t e s  i t s e l f  f r o m  o t h e r models in a number of ways: mainly that it is generally ruled by a single group rather than a single person. Most often, this ruling group is a council composed of elected representatives from the city’s various wards, guilds, or districts. A democratic city often retains its local focus even if it is also a capital city. If the larger government is similarly democratic, then the city likely hosts a senate (or similar congress), but in any republic, the operation of a city must remain separate from the administration of a nation. As such, in democratic capital cities, one often ﬁ  nds the council working side by side with a separate and distinct national govern-ment. Democratic cities generally flourish only in good-aligned regions, where the communal desire to reach consensus has a chance to overpower humanity’s natural divisiveness. Evil-aligned democratic cities are rare in the extreme.THE FEUDAL CITY The feudal city is usually similar to the autocratic city in its basic operation; that is, it is often the product of a monocratic national system. The primary difference lies in how the local government takes shape. As with an autocratic city, a single individual (a duke or similar landed noble) usually governs a feudal city. He or she rules it as part of a personal fief, and is beholden in turn to a higher liege (usually the king). Technically speaking, the duke rules his or her own lands on political behalf of another, who is the ultimate arbiter in matters of law and policy (since the fiefdom lies within the boundaries of the superior’s domain). Feudal cities are further distinguished by the size and complexity of the resident nobility, many of whom are landed gentry in their own right (having been ceded territory by the local duke). In this regard, feudal cities are generally “healthier” than truly autocratic cities, since the size and influence of the middle class is substantially larger. Between the royal family, the landed nobility, the gentry, the church, and the working class, the feudal city displays almost as much complexity as the democratic city. The highest-ranking noble has the final word on matters of state, of course, but the governing family—no matter how wealthy or influen- tial—doesn’t exist in a vacuum, making a feudal city the perfect environment for thorny and scandalous high-society intrigue. Complicating matters further, feudal cities typically have strong parliaments—either assisting the ruler in governing or legislating policy in their own right—made up of other landed nobles. As such, the city’s ruler must spend much time and effort courting the favor of the other nobles, regardless of (or because of) the fact that his authority technically outstrips their own. By its very deﬁ  nition, the feudal city is almost never a capital. If the king is in residence, he has no need of a duke or other sworn representative, making it an autocratic city by default. Feudal cities exhibit align- ments of every sort, though good- and neutral-aligned communities still make up the majority. Evil-aligned feudal cities are hotbeds of backstabbing scandal and intrigue of every variety. THE MAGOCRATIC CITY Despite the strong presence of magic in most fantasy settings, magocracies remain extremely rare. Even in high-magic campaigns, few areas produce more than a handful of powerful arcane spellcasters, and only a tiny number would willingly forgo their lives of quiet study to embrace dreams of political dominance. Magocracies are substantially more common, however, in regions dominated by nonhumans (particularly 620_95386_Ch3.indd   70620_95386_Ch3.indd   70 8/22/06   9:19:04 AM8/22/06   9:19:04 AM71CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERthose with strong arcane traditions, such as the drow and other elf races). When they do occur, magocratic cities are marvels to behold, demonstrating a public embrace of magic as a means by which the city can be designed and run. The primary drawback of such a system, of course, is that nonspellcasters face severely limited lives. Technically speaking, magocratic cities are oligar-chies—political systems in which all power lies in the hands of a small ruling elite. As a result, mago-cratic cities resem ble tribal cities in that they tend  to flourish when the power of the local government doesn’t reach beyond the city’s immediate surround-ings. Councils of wizards can administer small areas with little difficulty but tend to falter when trying to preside over massive swaths of territory. The only circumstance in which the system works on a large s c a l e  i s  w h e n  i t  c o m b i n e s  w i t h  t h e  f e u d a l  s y s t e m ,  using a complex web of interconnected but indepen-dent governing lords, bound by magical might or focus rather than by noble blood. Magocratic cities r a r e l y  a p p e a r  i n  g o o d - a l i g n e d  r e g i o n s ,  s i n c e  t h e i r  oligarchic structure keeps the populace divided, but are relatively common in neutral-aligned cities that stand independent from any higher authority. Evil- aligned magocratic cities are despotic nightmares, in which life for the common folk is both meticulously monitored and rigidly controlled. THE THEOCRATIC CITY A theocratic city is similar to a magocratic city; it is governed by a religious elite instead of a spellcasting elite, but the two are otherwise very much alike. Unlike magocracies, however, theocracies are relatively com-monplace in the fantasy world. Due to the power of the gods, which can actually be seen and felt thanks to the gifts of divine magic, the masses might embrace religion on an overwhelming scale—leading some areas to forgo traditional forms of government in favor of theocracies. In addition, unlike magocracies, one needn’t be an actual cleric or other divine spellcaster in order to join the ruling elite; so long as one holds sufﬁ  cient rank within the church (appropriate levels in aristocrat or even expert will do), one can garner enough support to function effectively within a theocratic system. These forms of government usually leave little room for guessing as to who is in charge, and religious iconography appears in every shop and street corner. People in such cities often want for little, but woe betide any nonbeliever. . . . Theocracies, like magocracies, are technically oligar- chies, since all power lies in the hands of a select few. Each theocracy varies depending on the particulars of their faith, however, so the actual administration of city affairs runs the gamut in theocratic cities. So m e  tak e  a  m o r e  d e ta ch e d  a p p r o a ch ,  all o win g  f o r  the creation of parliaments and other civic agencies, while others demand absolute control (or at least direct oversight) over every aspect of daily life. Unlike magocracies, which tend to localize their influence, theocracies often spread as far and wide as possible. S o m e  o f  t h e  m o s t  p o w e r f u l  a n d  l o n g e s t - l a s t i n g regimes in history have been theocracies; such dynas- ties end only in the face of popular revolt, or because of intervention from outside forces. Theocratic cities resemble feudal cities in that they can appear in regions dominated by every possible alignment, th o ugh expansio nist th eocraci es t e n d t o surface in  areas where evil predominates. THE TRIBAL CITY A tribal city has much in common with an autocratic city, and depending on the structure of the ruling clan, a feudal city as well. Power lies with a local chief, who might or might not answer to a higher chieftain of his own. As a rule, the tribal structure only works well on a small scale; like communism, the farther it spreads, the shakier its foundation becomes. The intriguing exception to this, like the magocratic city, comes with nonhuman communities. Indeed, some humanoid races (particularly the so-called races of savagery, such as goblins, orcs, and the like) understand only a tribal structure, and can extend its efficiency to include entire kingdoms, each ruled by a supreme tribal chieftain. The look and operation of a tribal city depends on the tribe in power, of course, and to a lesser extent on the mix of races and cultures over which the tribe rules. Savage tribes tend to demonstrate their power and dominance at every turn, festooning the streets with heads on spikes and similar decorations, while more cultured tribes merely try to make the city an honest reflection of themselves. No matter what the nature of the ruling tribe, however, those outside its membership—or worse yet, members of a rival tribe—will find life difficult in the extreme. The larger it gets, the more a tribal city takes on the aspects of a feudal city. Because a ruling clan or family can only oversee so much on its own, it must eventually rely on the input and support of other families to govern. Indeed, tribal cities often grow to become metropolises when a powerful tribe gathers neighboring tribes to its banner, and either subsumes them into itself (thus creating a tribal system of nobility) or rules over them with their support. The greatest and most successful tribal regimes keep the values of their people—ties of faith, blood, ancestry, and belief—in mind at every turn during their expansion and growth. A united 620_95386_Ch3.indd   71620_95386_Ch3.indd   71 8/22/06   9:19:08 AM8/22/06   9:19:08 AM72 CHAPTER 3 POLITICS AND POWERtribe is a powerful thing to behold, no matter what its culture is. Tribal cities are typically associated with (and primarily encountered in) areas on the so-called “edge of civilization.” This is only a stereotype, how-ever, and some of the largest and most self-sustaining metropolises follow a variant of the tribal structure. A tribal city usually falls when it faces internal dissent or revolt, and it tends to go down hard—often taking the entire populace with it in blood-soaked conﬂ  ict. Tribal cities are a close step behind feudal cities and theocratic cities in that they can appear in regions dominated by every possible alignment. Despite this, the preponderance of tribal fantasy cities are either neutral or evil. POLITICAL POSITIONS The fantasy city wears myriad cultural faces, but the default setting of the D\u0026D game presupposes a Western European style; the following information is tailored to ﬁ t such a setting. Most of these positions can be found in areas and cultures that don’t ﬁ  t this standard; they simply need a different name and a slight adjustment to their ﬂ  avor to better suit the campaign. An Egyptian- themed setting, for example, might not have mayors in its urban centers but appropriate equivalents (in this case, nomarchs). Mayor Regardless of the national government above them, most major settlements in the urban fantasy world have a mayor, or a closely analogous ﬁ  gure. The position typi- cally originates among the people—often in an attempt to bring more governmental involvement to their own lives (since they themselves elect someone to this posi-tion). A mayor is the most public face of a city’s politics, and although the ofﬁ  ce-holder is usually selected by the people, he or she often remains fully beholden to the local government.

They are not required to accept any job offers the guild might point their way, but constant refusal of employment might eventually upset the guildmasters. Finally, members must be willing, if asked, to embark on a quest to rescue or discern the fate of other missing guild members.

Wizards make up the majority of guild members, with bards, sorcerers, and other casters a distinct minority. These guilds offer comfortable and well-stocked libraries for research, and laboratories for experimentation. Perhaps more important, they offer an environment where casters can exchange ideas and theories, or simply interact with those who actually understand them. Arcane guilds are also valuable as political leverage in cities where governments or common folk distrust the use of magic. Examples:  Mages guild, alchemists guild.",

SCHOLASTIC GUILDS A scholastic guild can be anything from a small circle of researchers dedicated to studying a particular topic to a full-scale university providing knowledge to all who wish it. In any case, the guild works to further the knowledge and education of its members, if not its entire commu-nity. It provides libraries, places of study and academic discourse, an atmosphere conducive to the acquisition of knowledge, and possibly instructors willing to educate students in one or more subjects. Some scholastic guilds overlap with arcane or psionic guilds if the culture considers magic or psionics to be just another ﬁ  eld of study.",

I am my city’s preparation.” —Freilya Stormwind, black vigilant of the League of Eyes The city has stood for centuries, weathering attacks of every kind—from wild animal incursions to rampaging hordes of raiders to infestations of monstrous vermin. And for most of that time, one secret society has defended it against all threats: the League of Eyes. Dedicated to the study of the creatures that prowl the urban jungle, the League of Eyes remains secretive (despite a long history of admiration from a grateful public), training and employing a corps of knowledgeable agents known as urban savants. The League would be of no use to the city were it not for these educated few, who devote their time to studying the city’s traditional threats and watch-ing for signs of renewed aggression from any source. Their vigilance and expertise have turned the tide of battle more than once in the past, and will undoubtedly do so again. BECOMING AN URBAN SAVANT An urban savant is a scholar at heart, with a voracious appetite for information. While those of an intellectual bent (particularly bards and wizards) are best suited to the role, urban savants also hail from the ranks of skill-heavy classes such as rangers and rogues. Knowledge-hungry experts constitute a substantial minority as well. To meet the Knowledge skill requirements, most others must either multiclass or wait until higher levels to become urban savants.

It is capable of assuming multiple forms; each is drawn from the building blocks of the city and culture. Mob Manifestation A zeitgeist can take the form of a mob of humans (page 124), albeit of Huge size. It cannot make slam attacks in this form, instead making mob attacks as described in that entry. It retains its own Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities, rather than adapting those of the mob. Smoke Manifestation A zeitgeist in this form appears to be an enormous cloud of semi-solid rolling smoke. In smoke form, the zeitgeist’s melee attacks are slams dealing 2d4+6 points of damage (plus ﬁ re damage, as described below). It gains the following abilities: Air Mastery (Ex):  Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a zeitgeist manifested as smoke. Choke (Ex):  In smoke form, the zeitgeist can move into an opponent’s square as though making a trample attack. The victim takes 1d4 points of damage and must make a DC 26 Fortitude save or be sickened by the choking vapors. This effect lasts as long as the creature remains within the smoke and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Fiery Slam (Ex):  A zeitgeist deals 1d4 points of damage with its slam attack. The heat of the smoke is not suf-ﬁ cient to set creatures or objects alight, however. Subtypes (Ex): A zeitgeist manifested as smoke gains both the air and ﬁ  re subtypes. Flight (Ex):  A zeitgeist manifested as smoke is natu- rally buoyant. At will as a free action, it can produce an effect like that of the ﬂ y  spell (caster level 5th), except that the effect applies only to itself. This ability gives it a ﬂ y speed of 120 feet (perfect). Stone Manifestation A zeitgeist taking this form appears to be a huge human- oid ﬁ  gure, composed of stones, detritus, and even whole buildings. In stone form, a zeitgeist’s melee attacks are two slams dealing 2d8+6 points of damage. In this form, a zeitgeist gains the following abilities: Earth Mastery (Ex): A zeitgeist manifested as stone gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it pqs ZEITGEIST LORE Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (nature) can learn more about zeitgeists.

This result reveals all fey traits.30  Zeitgeists are strange, phantasmal fey that spontaneously arise in some select cities. They are driven by the alignment and emotion of the city’s populace, and are capable of manifesting in several physical forms. 35  A zeitgeist’s forms include a body of smoke, a body of stone and buildings, and a mob of humanoids. It can see in all directions, and is capable of using a great number of magical abilities at will. 40  Destroying a zeitgeist in any of its manifested forms does not destroy the creature permanently.

If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the zeitgeist takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS Zeitgeists are solitary creatures that consider the city to be their territory and their protected ground. They are incapable of leaving “their” city and they die if the city is destroyed. Zeitgeists manifest almost exclusively in violent con-ditions, so they always appear combative. Zeitgeists do not deliberately work with other creatures, though they might wind up ﬁ  ghting alongside others who seek to defend the city. Because they are driven by the emotions and alignment of the community, their behavior can be wildly unpredictable. SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS Zeitgeists do not deliberately ally with other creatures, but they sometimes manifest under circumstances that make conditions unusually dangerous. EL 23: A zeitgeist appears when its city falls under siege. Unfortunately, because the battle has already moved within the walls, it considers soldiers on both  sides a danger to the city, and kills indiscriminately. EL 24:  An  e n o rm o u s  ri o t ,  c o v e rin g  m ul ti p l e  di s - tricts, has generated sufficient emotional resonance to bring forth the city’s zeitgeist. Driven by the mob’s uncontrolled emotion, the zeitgeist is proving just as mindlessly destructive. EL 24:  A zeitgeist appears in the midst of a natural catastrophe such as a flood. The fear of the populace drives it to strange behaviors. It rescues some citizens but kills others, without apparent rhyme or reason. ECOLOGY Zeitgeists, unlike most fey, appear to have no biological needs. So long as their city survives, they survive. They do not age, but neither do they reproduce. Rather, a few cities seem to spontaneously generate these strange fey.",

        "description":  "Creatures able to see invisibility describe an unmanifested zeitgeist as a vaguely humanoid-shaped bank of mist, roiling with multiple colors. The colors appear to match those hues most commonly worn by the people of the city. SOCIETY Zeitgeists do not see themselves as members of a speciﬁ  c race; that is, one zeitgeist never gives any thought to the possibility of other zeitgeists. Rather, each sees itself as a natural part of the community from which it formed. Zeitgeists do what they can to protect their cities, yet they can also prove destructive to those same commu-nities. This is due to the zeitgeist’s driving factor—the emotions of the citizenry. If a large portion of the population is angry (such as during a riot or repulsing an attack), the zeitgeist grows angry. If the populace is scared, the zeitgeist grows scared, and might lash out at random targets. Zeitgeists see the city as important, but they view individual parts of the city—such as speciﬁ  c buildings or people—as less so. A zeitgeist rarely hesitates to destroy creatures or places, so long as it is not putting the entire city at risk. Alignment:  A zeitgeist’s alignment actually varies dramatically. It normally shares the alignment of the major- ity of the population of its city. This alignment is heavily inﬂ uenced by emotion, however. Thus, since the zeitgeist normally manifests only during periods of conﬂ  ict, it normally manifests with a chaotic neutral alignment—its only concern is either to preserve itself or its city, or to wreak destruction to assuage its rage or fear. ADVANCED ZEITGEISTS Few zeitgeists grow larger than that discussed here, but a few truly large and ancient cities might generate larger zeitgeists. A zeitgeist of up to 30 Hit Dice remains Huge, while zeitgeists of 31 to 60 Hit Dice are Gargantuan. ZEITGEISTS IN EBERRON Z e i t g e is t s  ar e  s urp ris in gl y  rar e  o n  Kh o rv air e ,  p e r h a ps due to the destruction that was wrought by the Last War, and the number of cities that were decimated during that conf lict. They appear more frequently within the few large cities found on Xen’drik and Sarlona. ZEITGEISTS IN FAERÛN Zeitgeists appear most frequently in those cities that can trace their ancestry back to the Netheril Empire, or to those that played hosts to wandering gods during the Time of Troubles. 620_95386_Ch4.indd   140620_95386_Ch4.indd   140 8/22/06   9:32:42 AM8/22/06   9:32:42 AMo truly make an urban campaign come alive, and to take full advantage of all the city has to offer, the Dungeon Master must do more than simply incorporate guilds, churches, and urban NPCs into an otherwise traditional game. The urban campaign has a mood and feel all its own, and can be used to accomplish things, to set up speciﬁ  c plot points and to tell particular tales, that cannot happen elsewhere. WHY THE CITY? So why run an urban campaign? What is it that city-based fantasy has to offer that other settings do not? First and foremost, they permit the characters to retain a connection to a “normal”—or at least a previous—life. They are still concerned about their forthcoming adventure—the next monster to face, and the next treasure to retrieve—but characters also have the oppor- tunity to visit with family, to build their own tavern or shop, to hold down a career as a city guard, a gladiator, a spellcaster-for-hire, or even an adviser to the duke. Urban campaigns are a great opportunity for players to ﬂ  esh out their characters’ interests, personalities, and activities in ways that other campaigns cannot offer, and for DMs to set up the sort of adventures they could not arrange elsewhere. The city offers adventurers the opportunity not only to hunt monsters in the sewers or track down a killer in the slums, but also to overcome political rivals in the local guild, ﬁ  gure out why the magistrates are suddenly allowing criminals to roam free, and to investigate an arson attempt on their own tavern. A monster hunt takes on a whole new meaning when the PCs have family dwelling in the victimized district, or when they themselves are threatened by the economic damage caused by closing shops. Not all these challenges will appeal to all play-ers, of course. Some players prefer straightforward monster hunts, and that’s ﬁ  ne. The city is as viable a site for such adventures as anywhere else, and these players face new tactical challenges as they must ﬁ  gure out how to defeat the monsters in the alleys or the catacombs without harming the buildings and the bystanders around them. For players who want a greater variety of challenges, however, the city offers a veritable buffet. The PCs might have to hunt monsters one day, solve a murder the second, protect their reputations from the slander of a guild rival the third, prove them-selves innocent of a writ of outlawry the fourth, and ﬁ  nally track down the mastermind behind 141Illus. by D.

The city still gives heavy fighters and combat-oriented arcanists a chance to shine, while offering the skill-masters, the negotia- tors, and the researchers their moments in the spotlight as well.  Perhaps most important, at least in the eyes of some players, is the opportunity to really delve into the goals and motivations of their characters. It’s all well and good to set out on adventures for fortune and glory, but what are the character’s motiva-tions? What does she plan to do with all the treasure hoards she liberates? In a city cam-paign, the players can spend time not only acquiring those riches, but putting them to immediate use. One character might visit with their poverty-stricken family, offer-ing them more money from one adventure than they’ve seen in a lifetime. Another might buy that old tavern he used to love, renovating it and hiring an old friend to run it while he continues his adventuring lifestyle. Such an establishment might even serve as a useful base of operations where the group can relax between quests, and where anyone who wishes to hire them knows they can be found.  Alternatively, characters might have other career goals, activities and objectives that the DM can use to bring adventure to them, rather than sending them searching for it. The PCs might be members of the city guard or the baron’s personal investigators, dispatched to deal with monsters, hauntings, and mysteries that the average watchman cannot handle. Perhaps the characters are members of a gladiatorial stable, ﬁ  ghting in the arena once a week or so while spending the rest of their time building a reputation by hunting strange creatures outside the coliseum. Maybe they are undercover temple inquisitors, seeking jobs in the city govern-ment, all the while investigating reports of corruption and demon-worship in the ranks of the senate. Or perhaps they’re all members or employees of a particular merchant house, with a cause no more noble than protecting the family’s assets against both political and monstrous threats.  In short, an urban campaign might focus heavily on the minds, the lives, the desires, and the goals of the characters. It’s certainly not impossible to explore these aspects in In an urban campaign, characters have more— but they also have more to loseIllus. by H. Lyon 620_95386_Ch5.indd   142620_95386_Ch5.indd   142 8/22/06   9:49:23 AM8/22/06   9:49:23 AM143CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITYother campaigns, but the city setting makes it a much easier task. This not only provides options for players, but for the DM as well. The fact that the players have a personal stake in their characters’ lives, homes, and surroundings means that any threat to the area hits them much harder, and grabs their attention more solidly. Most heroes respond if a city is threatened by a dragon, a corrupt leader, or even a simple ﬂ  ood—but when it’s their  city, with their families and their careers and their shops, it becomes a much more urgent matter. It’s possible to overdo this, though. The occasional threat to everything the PCs have worked for is ﬁ  ne. If it becomes a “city-destroying monster of the week” campaign, however, it tends to lose its punch. Thankfully for the DM, the urban environment offers far more than just the opportunity to hit the players where they live. Just as the city allows noncombative PCs to shine, so too does it allow the Dungeon Master to break out unusual villains. Been itching to try out an NPC bard, but never had the chance because you knew she couldn’t stand up to the group in a direct ﬁ  ght? Make her a politician, or a high-ranking member of a guild or noble house. She’s a rival of the PCs, someone who doesn’t ﬁ  ght them head on, but ruins their good names, buys out goods or establishments on which they’ve had their eye, ruins the careers of their friends and contacts. She is a villain the PCs cannot simply kill; they must put up with her efforts against them until they ﬁ  nd a means of outmaneuvering her, of digging up her secrets and learning her goals, of bringing her down politically just as she has tried to do to them. The city offers the opportunity for mystery. Even if a group is capable of facing off against deadly monsters and brutal killers, they can’t do much until they ﬁ  nd their adversary. Bodies left in alleyways, missing magic items—these all require investigation before their culprits can be defeated. If you’ve never run adventures like this before and are starting to get nervous, never fear. Advice for running political games, mysteries, and more can be found later in the chapter. And again, if you’d rather just stick with more straightforward adventures, we’ve got you covered there, too. Beyond the villains, a city campaign allows the DM to explore a cast of NPCs in greater detail than elsewhere. While he still must portray multiple personalities, as compared to the one that each of his players portrays, the DM has the opportunity to delve into NPCs’ goals and mannerisms in greater detail than many other campaigns allow. In a city campaign, it is highly likely that the group develops a select group of allies and acquaintances with whom they deal on a regular basis (see Contacts, page 57). These can, in a sense, almost become the DM’s own characters. So long as the Dungeon Master maintains perspective, and never allows them to overshadow the player characters, this can be a wonderful opportunity for the DM to get to know his characters almost as well as the players get to know theirs. Finally, despite taking place in a largely ﬁ  xed environ- ment with a cast of recurring characters, the urban setting offers the DM a surprising amount of ﬂ  exibility to shake up the campaign. In how many other campaigns can the DM alter the entire feel of the setting by replacing a single NPC? In the city, if the duke dies and is replaced, or if the council falls under the sway of a particular member, or even if a guild simply changes hands, everything in which the PCs are involved might change as well. The city’s laws and procedures might be altered. A group of heroes might suddenly ﬁ  nd themselves declared outlaws or suddenly and inexplicably lose favor with the nobles. Political allies might become rivals and vice-versa. The urban campaign allows the DM almost inﬁ  nite room for change, if he’s not afraid to shake things up. CITY HISTORY It’s important for the DM to have some sense of what’s happened in and to the city in the generations before the campaign takes place. This doesn’t mean that he must have an in-depth written history, complete with names and dates (though there’s nothing wrong with that, if that’s the sort of preparation you enjoy). Rather, he simply needs to know basics and generalities of the city’s past. For what purpose was the city founded, if any? Has it faced any major struggles or invasions? Was it the site of any great battles, or vital mystical discoveries? Did a previous settlement exist here? Have there been any violent uprisings or overthrows of the government? Does it have any holy (or unholy) signiﬁ  cance? This basic level of knowledge is vital, and not just so the DM has something to say when a PC rolls a 27 on her Knowledge (history) check. Nothing shapes the current status of a city, and even its physical construction, like what has come before. If it was once the center of some dark religion, a tiny hidden remnant of that faith might yet exist as a cult. If a previous city stood here, ruins or underground catacombs might exist beneath the city’s sewers. If the city has faced violent uprisings or powerful criminal guilds in the past, the government probably maintains a larger and more effective city guard than in other communities. And of course, the motivations and purpose behind the founding of the city have a strong impact on its layout, as described in Chapter One. Not only do these historical events shape the city, they provide the basis for many adventures. The aforementioned cult could become a long-term enemy of the group, or a sinkhole in a sewer tunnel might reveal undiscovered catacombs just waiting for intrepid explorers.

        "description":  "The members of one race form a separate and very unequal social class in the dominant society. They might be freed slaves or the remnant of a conquered nation, and their status in the society remains second-class at best. Little or no opportunity for advancement is afforded to the members of the underclass, and personal prejudice against them is deeply ingrained in the dominant society. Acts of violence or mob “justice” against members of the underclass are not uncommon. The native culture of the oppressed race is viewed with scorn by the dominant race. JOBS Even in the wildest urban fantasy environments, most city-dwellers are not adventurers. They are alchemists and architects, laborers and lawyers, scribes and smiths, just like everywhere else. The living wage these common folk earn will vary somewhat depending on the region, the size of their city, and the wealth of the nation in which the city is located, but by and large will follow a standardized rate in most fantasy settings. The following table shows the average weekly income for occupations in the average fantasy city. Table 5–1: Average Income * In unusually wealthy cities, these figures are adjusted upward. Add 1 gp or 1 sp (as appropriate) to any static value; add 1d4 gp or 1d4 sp (as appropriate) to any value that involves a die roll. In particularly poor cities, these figures are adjusted downward by the same amount. Characters of various classes—both PC classes and NPC classes—ﬁ  ll a tremendous variety of roles within a city, and neither roles nor titles often neatly correspond to a given class or level. Two people with the exact same rank and function within the city watch might be a warrior 5 and a ﬁ  ghter 3. The High Priest at one temple might be a cleric 12 while the same role at another temple is ﬁ  lled by an adept 3 (or even a commoner 6). Multiclassing only muddies the waters further: a cleric 4/ﬁ  ghter 6 might serve a primarily religious function, or might be a member of the city guard (who supports the guard with healing magic), or could even be a templar charged with defending a temple against attack. The following lists are intended to help you imagine what roles NPCs of various classes might ﬁ  ll within a city, but by their very nature they are more limiting than the “reality” of a fantasy city.

This section provides a sampling of locations that can help make even the most basic sites—blacksmiths, curio shops, restaurants, tanneries, town halls, and more—come to life and stick in play-ers’ minds. Most of the information provided under each entry is available to PCs with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or DC 20 Knowledge (history) check, depending on the particular piece of information. Apples and Oranges:  T h i s  un a s s um in g  li ttl e  s t o r e began as a simple produce stand that mainly sold, as one can imagine, apples and oranges. But when the stand’s owner, Dora-lae Underhill (N female gnome adept1/com- moner3) started making a habit of engaging passersby in conversation, an unusual thing happened. What started with casual comments about the quality of others’ pur- chases turned swiftly into an open-ended dialog with her community. People would bring goods to Dora-lae’s stand, where she would provide detailed appraisals of the prod- ucts’ age, quality, and craftsmanship—including precise estimations as to when the products would break down or go bad and suggestions for alternate purchases—all in a matter of seconds. And all they’d have to do by way of recompense was to buy a piece of fruit or two. Dora-lae’s advice was so sound, and her knowledge of the design of things so innate, that she eventually decided to start charging for it. She opened a store she called Apples and Oranges, where people could come to compare products in a knowledgeable, unbiased way. And, of course, to buy fruit. Catch of the Day: The proprietor of the best seafood restaurant in town knows that there are really only two types of city restaurateur: The ones who want to make good impressions, and the ones who want to make good food. Chef Trumblek (LN male half-orc ﬁ  ghter pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCOMMONER OR EXPERT? Is the blacksmith on Winding Way a commoner or an expert? In game terms, it makes no difference insofar as the smith’s abil-ity to make items from iron is concerned; a commoner and an expert of the same level probably have the same skill ranks in Craft. In terms of the game world, commoners are more often menial laborers than master artisans. In a small village, the only blacksmith might be a commoner, but with little opportunity to advance in level, a commoner can’t compete in a big city with plenty of expert blacksmiths. The blacksmith who is a true expert might have commoner apprentices and a number of other com-moners who tend his forge and carry his firewood. The difference between commoners and experts lies primarily in education and opportunity. A person born into a commoner family rarely becomes an expert, and hardly ever learns skills—even specific Craft or Profession skills—other than those that her family teaches her. The child of a farmer learns Profession (farmer) and Handle Animal, takes Skill Focus (Profession), and tends his parents’ farm his whole life. An expert’s child has more money available and receives a better education—not necessarily a formal education, but enough to master many more skills.  All that said, the majority of the humanoid population is made up of commoners, not experts. Cities represent the larg-est concentrations of noncommoners in the world, but even in a bustling metropolis teeming with PC-classed characters, experts, and aristocrats, commoners still make up the majority of the population. Remember this statistic when placing experts and other NPCs in your city, and don’t be afraid to make the majority of NPCs your players encounter commoners. After all, most craftspeople don’t need six skills—one is enough to make a living. 620_95386_Ch5.indd   149620_95386_Ch5.indd   149 8/22/06   9:49:55 AM8/22/06   9:49:55 AM150 CHAPTER 5 RUNNING THE CITY2/commoner 3) has always considered himself one of the latter, and if the popularity of his business is any indicator, he’s done so to his credit. Although the Catch of the Day doesn’t boast a prime location or the prettiﬁ  ed decorations of its many competitors, the food is superb and prices are set to accommodate purses of every size. The result is a dining experience that’s hard to beat. Even the atmosphere is more pleasant than it might otherwise be, given its location, since most regulars know that causing trouble is liable to bring the six-foot-seven-inch, 285-pound Trumblek out of the kitchen, meat cleaver in hand. And nobody wants that . Edman’s Tannery:  As one might expect, this location houses the operation of a local tanner. What makes this one stand out is that it’s owned and operated by Edvart Edman (CG male human expert 4), who is blind. With but a single assistant at his disposal, many would assume that Edvart could scarcely hope to compete with his sighted peers, but his is one of the most successful operations of its kind in the city. His reputation for both speed and excellence has grown roughly in proportion to the spread of rumors surrounding the source of his talent. Those who have heard that he knows when customers are trying to cheat him on his fees suspect black magic; those who have actually seen such exchanges ﬁ  rsthand and watched as Edvart twirled each coin between his slim ﬁ ngers, know the truth is far more ordinary and thus far more special. Edvart Edman needs neither charm nor magic spell to do his job.",

Here the people dwelt together for protection against predators, and they first constructed structures rather than use existing shelters for protection against the elements. (For more on the legend of Desh, see Races of Destiny.) This legend itself is neither uncommon nor unknown today. What few realize, however, is how swiftly the natural and magical worlds adapt to changes within. Desh was not merely the first community, but it also birthed the first urban fey, a distant ancestor of what would become the mighty zeitgeist. Desharis knew nothing of his own origins. He knew only that of his two conflicting urges -- one to protect the sanctity of the natural world, the other to defend Desh and the people therein -- the latter was by far the stronger. Invisibly, he worked to stave off attacks from predators; to keep the village free of plague; and to aid its inhabitants when other humanoids attempted to raid Desh for its supplies. While the people of Desh thanked the gods and spirits for their fortune, however, they never knew of Desharis himself. The other fey of the world, horrified at the notion of a spreading society that might supplant the natural order, counted Desharis a traitor. They worked to thwart his efforts and even destroy him. Though he was, in effect, the very embodiment of community, Desharis was ever alone. Desharis grew bitter at the disdain of the other fey, and some suggest that he inspired the spread of civilization as vengeance against them. Whatever the case, Desharis spread as the notion of community did, growing ever Cityscape, Part 2 more diffuse, ever larger. Though he gained in size and influence, he gained nothing in the way of power; smaller villages added nothing to his abilities, and larger communities frequently birthed their own urban fey. Eventually, the spirit of community was too diffuse and spread out to exist as a being at all -- and yet, as the embodiment of civilization, now a permanent part of the world, he could not entirely fade away.",

        "description":  "Beginning at 4th level, a spellthief gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from a subset of the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see below). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player’s Handbook ). To learn or cast a spell, a spellthief must have a Cha - risma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so on). The DC for a saving throw against a spellthief’s spell is 10 + spell level + spellthief’s Cha modiﬁer. Like other spellcasters, a spellthief can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–3: The Spellthief. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–1, page 8 of the Player’s Handbook ). When Table 1–3 indicates that a spellthief gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level spellthief), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. A spellthief’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A spellthief begins play knowing no spells but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1–4: Spellthief Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma does not affect the number of spells he knows; the numbers on Table 1–4 are ﬁxed.) A spellthief can learn any sorcerer/wizard spell from the following schools: abjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. No other sorcerer/wizard spells are on the spellthief’s class spell list. Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third spellthief level after that (15th and 18th), a spellthief can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the spellthief “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level spellthief spell that the spellthief can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a spellthief could trade in a single 1st-level spell for a different 1st-level spell. A spellthief can swap only a single spell at any given level, and he must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. At 4th level and higher, a spellthief’s caster level for spells is one-half his spellthief level.Table 1–4: Spellthief Spells Known ———— — Spells Known ————— Level 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 1st — — — —  2nd — — — —  3rd — — — — 4th 2 1 — — — 5th 2 — — — 6th 3 — — —  7th 3 — — —  8th 4 2 1 — — 9th 4 2 — —10th 4 3 — —11th 4 3 2 1 — 12th 4 4 3 —13th 4 4 3 —14th 4 4 4 2 1 15th 4 4 4 316th 4 4 4 317th 5 4 4 418th 5 5 4 419th 5 5 5 4 20th 5 5 5 5 1  Provided that the spellthief has sufficient Charisma to have a bonus spell of this level. Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su):  At 5th level and higher, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature’s spell-like ability. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target’s spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action. This spell-like ability can originate from the target’s class, race, template, or any other source, and can be of any level up to a maximum of one-third the spellthief’s class level. A spellthief can select a speciﬁc spell-like ability to steal; otherwise, the DM chooses the ability at random. If the ability has a limited number of uses per day, the target must have at least one such use left, or the spellthief can’t steal the ability. If the target can’t use its ability at the present time (such as a summoned demon’s summon ability), the spellthief can’t steal it. A spellthief can use a stolen spell-like ability once. For all purposes (caster level, save DC, and so on), treat the spell-like ability as if it were being used by the original possessor of the ability. A spellthief must use the stolen spell-like ability within 1 minute of acquiring it, or it is lost harmlessly. Until the spellthief uses the ability (or until the minute elapses), the target cannot use the stolen ability. Absorb Spell (Su):  Beginning at 7th level, if a spellthief makes a successful save against a spell that targets him, he can attempt to absorb the spell energy for later use.

A spellthief can’t absorb a spell of a higher spell level than he could steal with his steal spell ability (see above). To absorb a spell that targets him, a spellthief must suc - ceed on a level check (1d20 + spellthief class level) against a DC of 10 + the spell’s caster level. Failure indicates that the spell has its normal effect. Success means that the spellthief suffers no effect from the spell and can cast the spell later (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells known) as if he had stolen the spell with his steal spell ability. His normal limit of total spell levels stolen still applies. At 20th level or higher, a spellthief can choose to use the stolen spell energy as an immediate action (see page 137), either to recast the original spell or to cast one of his own spells known using the stolen spell energy. Arcane Sight (Sp):  Beginning at 9th level, a spellthief can use arcane sight as a swift action (see page 137) a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modiﬁer (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level. Discover Spells (Ex): A spellthief of 13th level or higher who steals a spell from a spellcaster with his steal spell ability automatically learns the names of all other spells prepared or known by the spellcaster that are of the same spell level as the stolen spell. This knowledge allows the spellthief to better choose which spells to steal on subsequent attacks. For example, a 13th-level spellthief who steals dis - integrate from an enemy sorcerer would also discover the names of all other 6th-level spells known by that sorcerer. Steal Spell Resistance (Su):  Beginning at 15th level, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal some or all of a creature’s spell resistance. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target’s spell resistance by 5. The spellthief also gains spell resistance equal to 5 + his class level (up to a maximum value equal to the original spell resis - tance of the target). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal spell resistance with a touch as a standard action. The stolen spell resistance beneﬁts the spellthief for a number of rounds equal to the spellthief’s Charisma modiﬁer (minimum 1 round) and then returns to the target creature. If the spell resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen spell resis - tance disappears when the effect elapses. A spellthief can’t use this ability on the same creature again until the creature’s stolen spell resistance returns. HALFLING SPELLTHIEF STARTING PACKAGE",

Many have accused the Fochlucan masters of fomenting intrigues among the nearby kingdoms and using their famed neutrality to conceal the real extent of their meddling and manipulation. By advising mighty rulers and undertaking the tutoring of royal heirs, the Fochlucan bards turn the fate of kingdoms with nothing more than quiet words and whispered secrets. The Fochlucan College itself is located on the shores of the misty Loch Firrnen, a few miles from the town of Oakenway. The College is a rambling old stone building that resembles some- thing between a minor lord’s manor house and a decrepit old monastery. Green ivy covers its walls, and old lanterns hanging from its eaves warm its chill, misty nights with golden light. No more than a handful of its collegians are present at any given time—the strength of the organization lies in the learn-ing and skill of its individual members, not in any muster of warriors. Members are welcome to stay as long as they like but are expected to contribute to the college’s upkeep. The custom- ary donation is 50 gp a month (for itinerant members) or 200 gp a month (for members living on the premises). A small number of servants keep the College in order and prepare meals, but there are no guards or soldiers. Instead, its defense lies primarily in the reputation and influence of its mem- bers. Should trouble come anyway, the College is well defended by the handful of lyrists or guests who happen to be visiting at any given time. In case of serious trouble, the Fochlucans turn to the creatures of the surrounding forest. Through ancient pacts, the sylvan denizens of Loch Firrnen’s forests are pledged to defend the bards’ house against attack. The College is governed by the Yew Circle, a small council composed of the five most senior Fochlucans currently enrolled in the order. All five are nominally equal, but if the Circle’s opinion is divided on any important matter, the Eldest of the Circle—the Fochlucan who has served the longest in the col-lege—decides the issue. Currently, the Eldest of Fochlucan is Yew Master Hurlich Stennarden, a half-elf who has belonged to the College for better than fifty years. The masters of the Yew Circle rarely meet, since they are not often at the College at the same time. The Fochlucans are affiliated with several other bardic colleges in neighboring lands, including the College of Mac-Fuirmidh, the Doss School, and the High College of Anstruth, oldest and most knowledgeable of the colleges. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs48CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 49CLASS SKILLS The Fochlucan lyrist’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (any) (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).",

(This item and the other instru- ments of the bards are described in detail in Complete Arcane. ) This three-stringed masterwork lute grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (string instruments) checks and a +1 compe-tence bonus on bardic music checks for countersong, fascinate , and suggestion. The instrument can be played by anyone to produce light once per day. Any character with at least 2 ranks in Perform (string instruments) can use the bandore to cast flare, mending, and message each once per day.

Many have accused the Fochlucan masters of fomenting intrigues among the nearby kingdoms and using their famed neutrality to conceal the real extent of their meddling and manipulation. By advising mighty rulers and undertaking the tutoring of royal heirs, the Fochlucan bards turn the fate of kingdoms with nothing more than quiet words and whispered secrets. The Fochlucan College itself is located on the shores of the misty Loch Firrnen, a few miles from the town of Oakenway. The College is a rambling old stone building that resembles some- thing between a minor lord’s manor house and a decrepit old monastery. Green ivy covers its walls, and old lanterns hanging from its eaves warm its chill, misty nights with golden light. No more than a handful of its collegians are present at any given time—the strength of the organization lies in the learn-ing and skill of its individual members, not in any muster of warriors. Members are welcome to stay as long as they like but are expected to contribute to the college’s upkeep. The custom- ary donation is 50 gp a month (for itinerant members) or 200 gp a month (for members living on the premises). A small number of servants keep the College in order and prepare meals, but there are no guards or soldiers. Instead, its defense lies primarily in the reputation and influence of its mem- bers. Should trouble come anyway, the College is well defended by the handful of lyrists or guests who happen to be visiting at any given time. In case of serious trouble, the Fochlucans turn to the creatures of the surrounding forest. Through ancient pacts, the sylvan denizens of Loch Firrnen’s forests are pledged to defend the bards’ house against attack. The College is governed by the Yew Circle, a small council composed of the five most senior Fochlucans currently enrolled in the order. All five are nominally equal, but if the Circle’s opinion is divided on any important matter, the Eldest of the Circle—the Fochlucan who has served the longest in the col-lege—decides the issue. Currently, the Eldest of Fochlucan is Yew Master Hurlich Stennarden, a half-elf who has belonged to the College for better than fifty years. The masters of the Yew Circle rarely meet, since they are not often at the College at the same time. The Fochlucans are affiliated with several other bardic colleges in neighboring lands, including the College of Mac-Fuirmidh, the Doss School, and the High College of Anstruth, oldest and most knowledgeable of the colleges. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 50CHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 51normally allows her to attempt a Reﬂ  ex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex): Tyrea gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey. Trackless Step (Ex): Tyrea leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. Trapﬁ  nding (Ex): Tyrea can ﬁ  nd, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to ﬁ  nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Woodland Stride (Ex): Tyrea can move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar ter-rain at her normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it. Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Raelia retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when ﬂat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).",

For example, a 10th-level bard/4th-level virtuoso could use bardic music fourteen times per day, and his inspire courage ability would grant a +3 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls. A virtuoso also gains the fascinate bardic music ability, if he doesn’t already have it. He can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. See the bard class feature, page 29 of the Player’s Handbook. Virtuoso Performance (Su): A virtuoso can use his Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him. He can use this ability once per day per virtuoso level. He can use any form of performance as part of this ability. Although many of the names refer to musical performances, a virtuoso isn’t actually so limited—for example, an actor could perform a “sustaining soliloquy” or “sustaining dance” rather than a sustaining song. Each ability requires both a minimum virtuoso level and a minimum number of ranks in any Perform skill to qualify. If a virtuoso does not have the re- quired number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the virtuoso performance ability until he acquires the needed ranks. Starting a virtuoso performance effect is a standard action. Some virtuoso per- formance abilities require concen- tration, which means that the virtuoso must take a standard action each round to main- tain the ability. Unlike with bardic music, virtuoso perfor- mance doesn’t restrict a virtuo- so’s spellcasting or magic item activation. If a virtuoso’s perfor- mance requires sound, a deaf vir-tuoso has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use virtuoso performance. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. If a virtuoso has the bardic music class feature, he can spend two daily uses of bardic music to deliver a virtuoso performance. Persuasive Song (Ex):  A virtuoso with at least 11 ranks in a Perform skill can deliver a performance that sways the attitude of his audience. Treat this as a Diplomacy check made to inﬂ  uence NPC attitudes (see pages 71–72 of the Player’s Handbook ), but replace the Diplomacy check with a Perform check. Viewers must be within 30 feet of the virtuoso, be able to see and hear him clearly, and be will- ingly paying attention to his actions. This ability requires at least 10 consecutive rounds of concentration to take effect, and it can affect a particular creature only once per day. Hostile audience members can’t be inﬂ  uenced with this ability. Sustaining Song (Su): A virtuoso of 3rd level or higher with at least 13 ranks in a Perform skill can sustain his dying allies, assisting their recovery. Each round that the song continues, all allies within 30 feet of him automatically become stable (if dying) or regain 1 hit point (if stable and between –1 and –9 hit points). A sustaining song has no effect on enemies or on allies with 0 or more hit points. A virtuoso can keep up his sustaining song for 5 minutes. This is a mind-affecting ability. Jarring Song (Su): A virtuoso of 5th level or higher with at least 15 ranks in a Perform skill can inhibit spellcast-ing. Any enemy within 30 feet attempting to cast a spell during a jarring song must make a Concentration check with a DC equal to the virtuoso’s Perform check to avoid losing the spell. A virtuoso can keep up his jarring song for 10 rounds. Song of Fury (Su): A virtuoso of 7th level or higher with at least 17 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance to turn his allies into furious berserkers. Each ally within 30 feet who can see and hear the virtuoso can choose to enter a rage on her turn. This functions identically to a barbarian’s rage, except that it ends automatically if the virtuoso stops performing. If the ally already has the ability to rage, she can choose to apply the full effect of her own rage, without spending one of her daily uses of rage. A virtuoso can’t use song of fury on himself. This is a mind-affecting ability. Mindbending Melody (Sp) : A virtuoso of 9th level or higher with at least 19 ranks in a Perform skill can dominate a humanoid that he has already fascinated . This ability functions like a dominate person spell with a caster level equal to the virtuoso’s class level. The target can make a Will save (DC 10 + virtuoso’s class level + virtuoso’s Cha modiﬁ  er) to negate the effect. A mindbend- ing melody is a mind-affecting, language-dependent, enchantment (compulsion) ability. Revealing Melody (Su):  A 10th-level virtuoso with at least 20 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance to reveal all things as they actually are. All allies within 30 feet who can see and hear the virtuoso’s performance are affected as if by a true seeing spell with a caster level equal to the virtuoso’s class level. The effect lasts as long as the virtuoso performs. Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level, a virtuoso gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other beneﬁ  t a character of that class would have gained.

By offering advice, guidance, or simply leading by example, a character can effectively share some of her expertise with her comrades. However, this activity comes at a cost, since the character’s concentration is split between multiple tasks (and thus she isn’t as capable at the task as she would normally be). A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill who is engaged in a task using that skill can voluntarily accept a –4 penalty on the check in order to grant a +2 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue can help her allies sneak through a dungeon. By accepting a –4 penalty on her Hide and Move Silently checks, Lidda grants Jozan, Tordek, and Mialee each a +2 circumstance bonus on the same checks. While Lidda isn’t as quiet and hidden as she’d normally be, the group overall is more stealthy than they would be without her help. At higher levels, a character can grant more assistance, but at a greater cost. A character with 15 or more ranks in a skill can accept a –10 penalty on the check to grant a +5 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks made by nearby allies engaged in the same task. An ally must be within 30 feet of you to gain the bonus, and you must be able to see and hear each other. Using the previous example, if Lidda were invisible, she couldn’t grant the bonus to any character who couldn’t see her; if Mialee were invisible, Lidda couldn’t grant her the bonus unless she could see invisible creatures (but she could still grant the bonus to the other characters). Typically, only the following skills can be assisted in this manner: Balance, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Hide, Move Silently, Ride, Search, Survival, and Swim. In special circumstances, the DM may rule that other skills can beneﬁt from this assistance, or that characters can’t beneﬁt from this form of assistance even when using the skills described above. Aid Another The Player’s Handbook  describes how a character can help another character achieve success by aiding him with a skill check of the same type; a successful DC 10 check by the ﬁrst character grants a +2 circumstance bonus on the second character’s check to use the same skill (see pages 65–66 of the Player’s Handbook ). This section expands on that rule by allowing more skilled characters to grant greater assistance. When a character with 5 or more ranks in a skill uses the aid another action to assist another character’s skill check, he can grant a higher bonus than that described in the Player’s Handbook . For every 10 points of the helper’s check result above 10, the circumstance bonus increases by 1. Thus, a result of 10–19 would grant a +2 circumstance bonus (as normal), a result of 20–29 would grant a +3 circumstance bonus, a result of 30–39 a +4 circumstance bonus, and so on. (To determine the circumstance bonus quickly, simply divide the helper’s check result by 10, round down, and add 1.) This higher bonus is available only to helpers with at least 5 ranks in the skill being used. Only experienced characters have the ability to provide the extra assistance offered by this rule. At the DM’s option, this rule can also be extended to using the aid another action in combat to improve an ally’s attack roll or AC. Any character with a base attack bonus of +5 or higher can grant a greater bonus on an ally’s attack roll or AC as described above. This rule rewards the tactic of experienced combatants helping each other in a ﬁght (often the best option when ﬁghting a monster with an extremely high AC or attack bonus). Skill Synergy In addition to helping a character’s own skill checks, skill synergies can be used to aid the checks of allies as well. A character with 5 or more ranks in a skill that offers a bonus on another skill due to synergy can make a check using the ﬁrst skill to aid the skill that would normally receive the bonus from synergy. For example, Soveliss the 2nd-level ranger could make a Handle Animal check to aid Jozan’s Ride check (using the aid another rules described above and in the Player’s Handbook ), because a character with 5 ranks in Handle Animal gains a +2 bonus on Ride checks due to synergy. See Table 4–5: Skill Synergies, page 66 of the Player’s Handbook . The normal rules for aiding another still apply. For instance, even if Krusk the barbarian had 5 ranks in Handle Animal, he couldn’t use it to aid Vadania the druid’s wild empathy check, because Krusk can’t make a wild empathy check himself. Some combinations may be difﬁcult to imagine, but the DM should allow any synergistic aid another attempt that seems reasonable. For instance, it might seem odd at ﬁrst glance for Mialee to use Spellcraft to assist Lidda’s Use Magic Device check when reading a scroll—until you imagine the wizard leaning over the rogue’s shoulder, helping her sound out the tougher words.EXPANDED SKILL DESCRIPTIONS The section below outlines new and clariﬁed uses for some of the skills in the D\u0026D game.

        "description":  "A 5th-level wizard/1st-level rogue activates this feat, sacriﬁcing a prepared web spell. She gains a +2 insight bonus on her melee attack rolls against constructs for 1 round, and also adds 3d6 points of damage to successful attacks against constructs during that round (2d6 for the 2nd-level spell, plus 1d6 for her sneak attack damage). This feat does not allow you to deliver critical hits or sneak attacks against constructs or undead. STAGGERING STRIKE You can deliver a wound that hampers an opponent’s movement. Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6, sneak attack. Beneﬁt:  If you deal damage with a melee sneak attack, you can also deliver a wound that limits your foe’s mobility. For 1 round (or until the target is the beneﬁciary of a DC 15 Heal check or any magical heal - ing that restores at least 1 hit point, whichever comes ﬁrst), your target is treated as if it were staggered, even if its nonlethal damage doesn’t exactly equal its current hit points. A target can resist this effect by making a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to damage dealt). Multiple staggering strikes on the same creature do not stack. This feat has no effect on creatures not subject to sneak attack damage. SUBSONICS Your music can affect even those who do not consciously hear it. Prerequisite: Perform (any) 10 ranks, bardic music. Beneﬁt: You can produce music or poetics so subtly that opponents do not notice it, yet your allies still gain all the usual beneﬁts from your bardic music. Similarly, you can affect opponents within range with your music, but unless they can see you performing or have some other means of discovering it, they cannot determine the source of the effect. TACTILE TRAPSMITH You can rely on your rapid reﬂexes and nimble ﬁngers instead of your intellect when searching a room or when disabling a trap. Beneﬁt: You add your Dexterity bonus (rather than your Intelligence bonus) on all Search and Disable Device checks. In addition, you receive no penalty on these checks for darkness or blindness.
