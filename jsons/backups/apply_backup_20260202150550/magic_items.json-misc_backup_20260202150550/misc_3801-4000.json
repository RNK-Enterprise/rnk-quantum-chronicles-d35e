Con- sequently, running a campaign using this material can be challenging. Yet at the same time, for the same reasons, running a Ghostwalk campaign can be extremely rewarding for both you and your players. “When you die, you don’t have to stop playing”— that’s the core idea behind Ghostwalk. When characters die during an adventure in or near (or under) Manifest, the PCs immediately become ghosts that the players can keep playing. This is a new facet to playing the game that creates all sorts of interesting situations. Dungeon Masters should always keep the core idea in mind when running a Ghostwalkcampaign. Don’t let this unique aspect of the setting become commonplace and unspectacular to your players. STARTING A GHOSTWALKCAMPAIGN The first thing that you need to decide as a DM with this product in hand is how you’re going to use it. Is Manifest a city that the PCs will visit (possibly in an extended stay), or is it their home and the focus of the campaign? Will you add it to an existing setting, or will you use only what’s provided here? And once the action begins, what sort of campaign are you going to run? THEMATIC CAMPAIGNS IN MANIFEST There are as many types of D\u0026D campaigns as there are gaming groups. Some people like to make campaigns out of completely episodic adventures (one story having little or nothing to do with the previous or next). Others prefer campaigns that focus on a specific theme, and the PCs’ actions in one mission have reper- cussions that will affect all future adventures (and shape the development of the entire campaign setting). The unique nature of the city of Manifest makes it well suited to both styles of play—there’s something for everyone in the city on death’s doorstep. Dungeon Crawls Things get only more complicated when you start The basic unit of currency in the D\u0026D game is the to factor in the Yisa-khardomas.

They are not linked in any way, and you (the DM) can use them in whatever order you want; they are presented in order of recommended character levels from lowest to highest. Some of them are full-fledged adventures that take the characters to several locations in and around the city of Manifest, while others are simply site-based encounters that can be placed wherever you wish within the Undercity (or elsewhere, with some modifications). Of course, as with all adventures, you need a copy of the three D\u0026D core rulebooks—the Player’s Handbook, the DUNGEONMASTER’s Guide,and the Monster Manual— in order to use these adventures effectively. You should also read through each adventure ahead of time to familiarize yourself with the particulars. Text that appears in shaded boxes is player informa- tion, which you may read aloud or paraphrase, as appropriate. Text in sidebars contains important DM notes for you, offering insight into issues peculiar to the situation. Monster and nonplayer character (NPC) statistics are provided with each encounter in abbrevi- ated form. Full monster statistics for standard monsters are in either the Monster Manualor in Chapter 5 of this book. You should review all of these statistics before the game starts to refresh your memory of the crea- tures’ abilities. Each encounter is given an Encounter Level (EL) to let you know how challenging it should be for the adventurers. TOUCH AND GO An introductory Ghostwalk adventure for 1st-level characters. SYNOPSIS While in the Tombyards (see the map of Manifest in Chapter 2), the PCs are accosted by a ghoul. A strange note in the ghoul’s possession leads them to a clandes- tine meeting with some members of the Golden, Manifest’s thieves’ guild. The thieves have stolen a device they believe to be a powerful magic item from a wizard, but what they don’t realize is that the item you think that will interest them).

Armies assault or lay siege to these key objectives as a matter of course. Sometimes a great battle might be waged in a shallow valley between two hillocks, where the commanders can both look down upon the melee as it unfolds. Rugged hills offer plenty of hiding places, even for entire regiments, so skirmishes or small battles could result from ambushes. A battlefield in the hills could have any number of for- tifications, earthworks, or other terrain features, created by either the attackers or the defenders. Higher ground offers a significant advantage for an army, doubly so if it also occupies a stronghold atop a hill. Ruins of previous structures might provide low walls for cover. Natural features such as undergrowth, streams, and the occasional tree are also scattered about most hills terrain. Mountain Battlefields Massive conflicts in mountain terrain usually occur in alpine meadows. Only in such places is there enough open space for armies to gather into any sort of formation. Cliffs, chasms, and rubble make it difficult to muster a force of significant size in rugged mountains, and most great battles in (and over) forbidding mountains are usually of the aerial variety. Desert Battlefields The shifting dunes of a sandy desert quickly over- come any attempt at fortification. Trenches fill in with sand, walls become buried under sand dunes, and earthworks simply blow away. Rocky deserts and tundra both hamper the creation of structures due to a lack of avail- able material. Desert battlefields most often have just natural terrain features and few, if any, manufactured ones. Plains Battlefields Large meadows or tracts of farmland are perfect stages for clashes between massive armies, making plains ter- rain the most common site of battlefield Illus. by W.
