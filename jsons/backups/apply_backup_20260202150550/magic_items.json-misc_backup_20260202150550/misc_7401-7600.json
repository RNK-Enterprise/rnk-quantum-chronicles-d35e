Sand golems seem to be a part of the earth. They can move readily through sand and loose soil at their burrow speed, and they can do so indefi nitely, since they have no need to breathe. When fashioned, a sand golem is keyed to a set of magic amulets, usually in the shape of scarabs or scorpions. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of an amulet as its master, obeying that person’s commands without fail. The wearer of an amulet can call the sand golem from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane, no matter how long this might take. A sand golem cannot speak, although it can emit a dry hissing like the approach of a duststorm. SAND GOLEM Huge Construct COMBAT",

Storage Areas The city of Sohlak had numerous storage areas for every- thing from foodstuffs to lumber. The denizens of Harrax once had a need for storing food and such, but that is obviously no longer a concern. Most of these storage areas now contain useless bits of material, with the occasional stash of still-useful mundane items. For each half-hour spent searching a storage area, there is a 20% chance that the PCs turn up a randomly determined mundane item (see page 56 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Alchemical items have a 50% chance of being inert. 6. Barracks (EL 15) The two barracks buildings are perhaps the most daunting places in the necropolis. Each building contains thirty mummy warriors, six mummy captains, and one mummy commander. They immediately attack if disturbed, though only fi ve warriors and one captain approach the PCs at any given time. The other warriors and captains remain steadfastly in place until their predecessors are destroyed, whereupon fi ve new warriors advance to join the fray with a new captain in charge. The mummy commander gets involved only if he is directly attacked, or if all the captains are destroyed.
