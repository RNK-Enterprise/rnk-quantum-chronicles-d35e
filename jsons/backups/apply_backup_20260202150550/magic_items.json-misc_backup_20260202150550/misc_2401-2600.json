Use this value to adjust the Challenge Rating of the trap, as indicated on Table 3–13 or Table 3–14. Damage from poisons and pit spikes does not count toward this value, but damage from a high strength rating and extra damage from multiple attacks does. For example, if a trap fires 1d4 darts at each target, the average damage is the average number of darts ×the average damage per dart, rounded to the nearest multiple of 7, or 2.5 darts ×2.5 points of damage = 6.25 points, which rounds to 7. For a magic trap, only one modifier applies to the CR—either the level of the highest-level spell used in the trap, or the average damage figure, whichever is larger.",

THE ASTRAL PLANE The Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a charac- ter moves through an interplanar portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane, such as dimension door, briefly touch the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Large tube-shaped clouds slowly coil into the distance, some appearing like thunderheads and others looking like immobile tornadoes of gray wind. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain. Both planar travelers and refugees from other planes call the Astral Plane home. The most prominent denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an outcast race that preys on travelers throughout the plane. The Astral Plane has the following traits. • Subjective directional gravity. • Timeless. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing don’t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane. • Mildly neutral-aligned. • Enhanced magic. All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be em- ployed as if they were im- proved by the Quicken Spell feat. Already quick- ened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.",

These portal keys are sought after, and usually travelers within the city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key to allow them to continue on their way. Sigil is controlled by a number of factions, all of which may be politely described as “philosophers with clubs.” These factions are categorized along the lines of traditional alignments, and they con- trol different parts of the city and different services therein. The ultimate ruler of Sigil is an enigmatic being known as the Lady of Pain, a floating female humanoid with bladelike hair. The full extent of the Lady of Pain’s abilities is unknown, but it is widely assumed that her power equals or exceeds that of the deities. Sigil is huge—ten times the size of a Material Plane metropolis.

Todraw an encounter map for Sigil, start with a normal city- scape and add as much magic to the environment as you can.

RANDOM OUTER PLANE ENCOUNTERS Onthis page are four alignment-based random encounter tables that you can use if the PCs find themselves on one of the Outer Planes unexpectedly. If you’re writing an adventure that takes place on a particular Outer Plane, you can use these encounter tables as a starting point, designing specific tables that reflect the nature of the adventure site and the level of the PCs. CREATING A COSMOLOGY As you build your world, you’ll eventually move onto other worlds entirely—new planes where anything is possible. And if you’re ambitious, you can create your own cosmology. WHAT PLANES DO YOU NEED? The cosmology you create should fit the needs of your campaign. Assuming that the Material Plane of your campaign is essentially the same as the Material Plane of the D\u0026D cosmology, you need to decide what your cosmology will contribute to the campaign.
