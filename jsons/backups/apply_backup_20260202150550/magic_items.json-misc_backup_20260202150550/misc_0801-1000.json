You can perform one swift action per turn, without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action at any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve spellcast - ing or the activation of magic items; many characters (especially those who don’t cast spells) never have an opportunity to take a swift action.rom the assassin lurking in the corner, his dagger dripping with magically enhanced poison, to the ranger who ﬁlls the forest with a hail of magically propelled arrows, skilled adventur - ers of all kinds rely on spells to enhance their skills, avoid an enemy’s blows, and strike with deadly accu - racy. In keeping with the theme of  Complete Adventurer , the spells described in this chapter emphasize skill use—providing bonuses on skill checks, offering new uses for skills, and making skill use in combat more rewarding. These spells also often feature enhanced beneﬁts or effects for characters who have mastered unusual combinations of skills and abilities. These spells emphasize the versatility of the successful adventurer and should be of particular interest to multiclass characters.

Deﬁning a bard’s preferred performance styles by the precepts of his bardic college, choos - ing wizard spells based on the preferences of a magic academy, or taking jobs based on the directives of a thieves guild: All these add ﬂavor to a campaign world. Their breadth hints at the presence of organizations for nearly every class. The organizations described here, however, focus on groups whose members use a large variety of skills or who achieve unusually great expertise in a particular group of skills. Often, this expertise is associated with a criminal organization or its law-enforcement counterpart, but it also allows for many other types of organizations and the characters who belong to them. Being part of an organization must come with responsibilities and beneﬁts, or a character won’t feel connected to this important choice of allegiance.

BLACKLOCK LORESEEKERS Formerly a small collection of rogues and wizards dedicated to unearthing lost scraps of knowledge, the Blacklock Loreseekers have become a large and powerful organization of adventurers. The guild has chapterhouses in nearly every major city and many large towns, as well as in smaller outposts in outlying communities. As it has grown, the guild has become more focused on the mercantile aspects of adventuring, ﬁnding lost tombs and ancient artifacts with an eye toward proﬁt rather than knowledge. The Blacklock Loreseekers take their name from the guild’s founder, a dwarf adventurer by the name of Kurgarn Blacklock. Kurgarn long sought leads to the whereabouts of an artifact held sacred by his clan, and after he grew too old to continue adventuring himself, he formed the loreseekers to guide the efforts of younger mercenaries. Although Kurgan always saw the organiza -tion as primarily focused on amassing knowledge, in the long years since his death, the guild has become far more concerned with the acquisition and resale of valuable treasures and magic items. Although the Loreseekers’ focus on proﬁt makes some suspicious of their motives, the group remains an adventuring-oriented organization and does not engage in thievery or other criminal activi - ties.

The Loreseekers actively collect maps, and members are free to copy (but not remove) maps stored in the chapterhouse libraries. Members also can treat any community with a chap - terhouse as one size larger for purposes of determining the community’s gold piece limit. (See page 137 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide  for more information on community size and gold piece spending limits.) This beneﬁt allows members to sell more valuable items in smaller communities, and often presents them with more purchasing options as well. The guild is particularly good at making the heroic work of its members known to the common folk, and the DM should award small circumstance bonuses on the Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made by guild members against those who have heard of their exploits.

The administrators update the list of members and specialties annually and circulate that docu - ment, called a “yearbook,” to the current membership. Prestige Classes: Wizards and clerics who become members of the college typically aspire to take levels in the loremaster prestige class. Bards occasionally pursue the loremaster class, but more aspire to the virtuoso prestige class, hoping to continue the development of their musical abilities while focusing on their knowledge and magical talents. Lore of the Guild: The college focuses on acquiring knowledge developed by others rather than perform -ing speciﬁc deeds or accomplishing heroic missions. Although a few of the organization’s younger members remain active adventurers in order to seek out and recover lost tomes, scrolls, and other repositories of knowledge, the bulk of the guild’s membership spends most of its time in quiet study. Nonetheless, the famous split between the Talespinners League and the college is occasionally the subject of debate in all levels of society, especially by those concerned with the distribution of magical knowledge or ancient relics.",

In addition, the candidate must be able to read and write at least one obscure language. Depending on the desired specialty, the DCs may be higher or lower. Retries are allowed, but only to apply for a different specialty. The initial membership fee is 500 gp, which goes to pay for the creation and grading of the test. Annual dues are 250 gp; active collegians spend much more than this on their research, correspondence with other members, and occasional regional meetings. Character Beneﬁts: The greatest advantage to mem - bership in this college is access to the volumes of research its members produce each year. Unless they’ve somehow made enemies among their colleagues, members can count on receiving advance word of every discovery made in their ﬁelds. Members with speciﬁc questions also have the right to query members outside their own specialties for informa - tion. Answering such a query is rarely a high priority, however, especially if no reason is given for the request. Roleplaying Suggestions: Members of the college tend to be intelligent, focused on their academic pursuits, and strangely secretive. They prefer to ask questions rather than provide answers. Some nonmembers ﬁnd this off-putting. Few resent the pursuit of knowledge, but the college’s secretive nature sometimes angers those who enjoy a more free-ﬂowing exchange of information. In particular, members of the Talespinners League resent the collegians.",

Each member chooses an area of knowledge (such as “The Second Empire of Qirtaia” or “Vordhavian Death Magic”) as a specialty upon entering the college, but this choice can be changed as often as once a year. The administrators update the list of members and specialties annually and circulate that docu - ment, called a “yearbook,” to the current membership. Prestige Classes: Wizards and clerics who become members of the college typically aspire to take levels in the loremaster prestige class. Bards occasionally pursue the loremaster class, but more aspire to the virtuoso prestige class, hoping to continue the development of their musical abilities while focusing on their knowledge and magical talents. Lore of the Guild: The college focuses on acquiring knowledge developed by others rather than perform -ing speciﬁc deeds or accomplishing heroic missions. Although a few of the organization’s younger members remain active adventurers in order to seek out and recover lost tomes, scrolls, and other repositories of knowledge, the bulk of the guild’s membership spends most of its time in quiet study. Nonetheless, the famous split between the Talespinners League and the college is occasionally the subject of debate in all levels of society, especially by those concerned with the distribution of magical knowledge or ancient relics.",

One who joins an adventuring party often serves as the group’s primary negotiator, using his skills to smooth the group’s way with local authorities, ferreting out countless adven - ture leads through his association with the league, and providing a wealth of information through his diverse knowledge. Despite this common archetype, a few members go against the grain. These unusually introverted individuals approach storytelling as an art form, breaking out of their normally shy behavior only when properly prepared to tell a story. They see the exchange of information in story form as an opportunity to create and inspire. Although they are rare, they often are among the most respected storytellers in the league.",

This adventure site details thathaven of peaceful study. Secrets of the Fochlucan College is an adventure site that can be dropped into any area that has a large, clear lake.A variety of adventures can take place here, sinceoutsiders frequently infiltrate the college to search forits secrets. As always, feel free to adapt the materialpresented here as you see fit to make it work with yourcampaign. PREPARATION You (the DM) need the D\u0026D core rulebooks—thePlayer’s Handbook, the Dungeon Master’s Guide, and the Monster Manual —as well as Complete Adventurer— to use this adventure site. The information presented hereutilizes the D\u0026D v.3.5 rules. To get started, print out the adventure site, including the map. Read through it at least once to familiarizeyourself with the situation, site, and major NPCs(particularly their motivations). You must decide whatkind of action takes place—whether the PCs simplystumble upon the site or have a reason to visit. Monsterand NPC statistics are provided with each encounterarea in abbreviated form. BACKGROUND Visitors to the famous (or as some would say, infamous)Fochlucan College often come away disappointed.Given the reputation the Fochlucan masters havegained for international intrigue, most travelers expectto find a bustling citadel of learning that is also a bastionof military strength—with furnishings and a treasuryto match. Instead, they find a sleepy country retreatwhere a handful of distracted scholars study the minu-tia of the past, without so much as an armed guard insight. Thanks to a hardworking staff of servants, thewhole building is spotless, but the age of its furnishingsis obvious. Detractors might call the place threadbare orshabby, but it has a comfortable, lived-in look. In fact,the college looks much like a rural manor belonging toan impoverished noble family whose members havelong been accustomed to empty coffers. The college’s worn appearance reflects the building’s true role as a meeting place for energetic people whooccasionally need a place to rest or confer with colleagues. 2The Fochlucan masters obviously place a higher value on deeds and ideas than on brick and mortar. Over the years, the countless burglars and spies who have infiltrated the college have all but gone madsearching for secret documents, vast treasures, or both.These invaders inevitably fail, because the biggestsecret of the Fochlucan College is that it holds nosecrets at all. Still, it remains a place of mystery in thepopular imagination—a misconception that theFochlucan masters take no pains to correct. THE FOCHLUCAN COLLEGE As noted on page 49 of Complete Adventurer, the college is located on the shore of Loch Firrnen, a few milesfrom the town of Oakenway. Thick woods surround thelake and the building, separating them from the town.Visitors can hike through the woods to the lake andthen travel by water to the college, but an overland tripgenerally proves easier and is certainly more direct. No signposts point the way to the college, but a well- used road connecting Oakenway to nearby communi-ties passes fairly near the place, and a meandering pathconnects a loop in that road with the college. Mostcasual travelers overlook the connecting path because itlooks like a simple woodcutter’s lane or game trail. TheFochlucan masters make no special effort to conceal thecollege’s location, however, and most residents ofOakenway know the route. FEATURES The college is a two-story stone structure with a slateroof. A thick layer of climbing ivy covers its ancientwalls. Unless otherwise stated in the description of a specific area, the college’s major features are as follows. Walls The exterior walls are stone. The surface has begun tocrumble, and the clinging ivy makes climbing particu-larly difficult because the vines tend to tear away undera load. Thus, the DC for any Move Silently checks madewhile climbing an exterior wall increases by +5. ssIvy-Covered Wall: 3 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 270; Break DC 39; Climb DC 25. The interior walls are also made of stone. The surfaces are covered with smooth plaster. ssInterior Wall: 1 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 90; Break DC 35; Climb DC 20.Ceilings Unless otherwise noted, ceilings are 15 feet high on theground floor and 10 feet high on the upper floor. Floors The floors on the ground floor are made of smooth,fitted stones. The upper level has wooden floors. Rugsor carpets cover most of the floor area, but a fewsections are bare, as noted in the individual roomdescriptions. Doors The exterior doors are made of reinforced wood.Though all of them are equipped with locks, they arekept unlocked unless a particular threat necessitatesextra security. ssStrong W ooden Door: 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 20; Break DC 25; Open Lock DC 20. The interior doors are carved from simple wood. Most of them don’t have locks, but those grantingaccess to sleeping rooms and guest quarters do, as notedin the area descriptions. Interior doors aren’t lockedunless noted otherwise in an area description. ssSimple W ooden Door: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 15; Open Lock DC 20. Colver (the major domo; see Servant’s Room) and Noelin (the resident Yew Master; see Yew Master’sRoom) each have a set of master keys for all the doors inthe college. Fireplaces The college is equipped with several fireplaces for heat-ing and cooking. The building’s stone constructionensures that it remains cool and slightly damp even onhot days, so a small fire is usually kept burning in everyfireplace. A typical fireplace at the Fochlucan College measures about 5 feet high, 2 feet deep, and 5 feet wide. The chim-ney is about a foot square and 25 to 50 feet tall. (Thelonger chimneys begin on the ground floor.) A ceramiccap and copper grate at the top keep out the rain andsnow out and also prevent forest animals from entering.A Diminutive or smaller creature could climb inside achimney, but only if it entered via a fireplace or brokethrough the grate at the top. A Tiny creature couldenter a chimney the same way, but it would have tosqueeze in (see page 148 in the Player’s Handbook ). The outside of a chimney has a Climb DC of 25 (the same as an exterior wall), and the inside has a Climb DCof 10. However, the exterior is hot and smoky, and ittends to stay that way for about an hour even if all thefires in the fireplaces connected to it are extinguished.3 A creature climbing inside a chimney takes 1d4 points of fire damage each round from the hot surfaces andalso suffers the effects of heavy smoke (see page 304 inthe Dungeon Master’s Guide ). ssChimney Grate: 1 in. thick; hardness 10; hp 30; Break DC 26. Windows Every window is fitted with crystal-clear, leaded glassand a pair of simple wooden shutters. The windows areoccasionally opened for ventilation, but they can beclosed and latched to keep them from blowing open insevere weather. Likewise, the inhabitants can close andbar the shutters to keep the building snug in badweather. Normally the windows are kept closed but notlatched, and the shutters remain open. ssW ooden Shutters: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10; Break DC 13 (15 if barred). ssGlass Window Pane: 1/4 in. thick; hardness 1; hp 1; Break DC 5. Light Any room with a window has at least shadowy illumi-nation (see page 165 in the Player’s Handbook ) during daylight hours. Some areas are more brightly lit becausethey have extra windows or an artificial light source, asnoted in the individual room descriptions. GROUNDS The grounds occupy about 40 acres on the south shoreof Loch Firrnen, and the college itself stands about 10yards from the water’s edge. Scattered hardwoodtrees—mostly stately oaks, beeches, and assorted fruitand nut trees—grow throughout most of the grounds,providing a parklike atmosphere. Tall grass and a profu-sion of wildflowers cover the ground under the trees.",

Most of the classes in this book have stringent requirements that will require several levels of careful advancement to achieve. The player should think about what sort of arcane character she is trying to build; Table 2 –1 lists the prestige classes found in this chapter by broad categories that might help her narrow her choices. Should a character ﬁ nd herself in a position (because of changed alignment, lost levels, or the like) where she no longer meets the requirements of a prestige class, she 17Illus. by M.

        "description":  "These characters are interested in becoming something else, abandoning their original race to transcend their natural limitations. Transformational classes include the Green Star adept and acolyte of the skin. They typically require the sacri ﬁ ce of signi ﬁ cant amounts of spellcasting power, but they pay off with strong special abilities. Unique Capability:  T h i s  i s  a  c a t c h a l l  c a t e g o r y  f o r prestige classes that are otherwise dif ﬁ cult to character- ize. Generally, these classes offer potent powers along a particular theme that aren ’t available anywhere else. The blood magus is a good example of a unique capability class. Like a transformational class, a unique capability prestige class often trades spellcasting power for an array of power- ful special abilities. WARLOCKS AND PRESTIGE CLASSES Warlocks bene ﬁ t in a speci ﬁ c way from prestige classes that have “+1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class ” or “+1 level of existing spellcasting class ” as a level advancement bene ﬁ t. A w ar l ock takin g l e v e ls in su ch a p r esti g e class does not gain any of his class abilities, but he does gain an increased caster level when using his invocations and increased damage with his eldritch blast.  Levels of prestige classes that provide +1 level of spellcasting effectively stack with the warlock ’s level to determine his eldritch blast damage (treat his combined caster level as his warlock class level when looking at Table 1 –1: The Warlock to determine eldritch blast  damage) and his eldritch blast  caster level (half his total caster level from his warlock levels and his levels in the prestige class that grant him an increased spellcast-ing level). A warlock also gains new invocations known at these prestige class levels as though he had gained a level in the warlock class. A warlock cannot qualify for prestige classes with spellcasting level requirements, as he never actually learns to cast spells. However, prestige classes with caster level requirements, such as the acolyte of the skin, are well suited to the warlock. A warlock ’s caster level for his invocations fulﬁ lls this requirement. See page 71 in Chapter 3 for more details on caster level requirements, spellcasting level requirements, and speci ﬁ c spell requirements for feats and prestige classes.Table 2–1: Prestige Classes by Type Class Type Description Best For . . .Acolyte of the skin Transformational Acquire fiendish traits Sorcerer, warlock, wizardAlienist Full caster Insane spellcaster Cleric, sorcerer, wizardArgent savant Full caster Expert with force spells Sorcerer, warmage, wizardBlood magus Unique capability Blood powers, Sorcerer, warlock, wizard,   reduced spell progression wu jenEffigy master Full caster,  Expert in simulacrums  Sorcerer, wizard, wu jen unique capability and constructsElemental savant Full caster,  Expert with energy spells Druid, sorcerer, warmage,  transformational  wizardEnlightened fist Noncaster Monklike wizard or Monk, sorcerer, warlock,   spellcasting monk wizardFatespinner Full caster,  Manipulate probability Sorcerer, wizard, wu jen unique capabilityGeometer Full caster Master of signs and sigils Wizard, wu jenGreen Star adept Transformational Indestructible mage  Barbarian, ﬁ  ghter, sorcerer, warlock, wizard Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Full caster Master of abjurations and  Sorcerer, wizard  prismatic spellsMage of the Arcane Order Full caster Access to a Spellpool  Wizard, wu jen  that grants versatilityMaster transmogrifist Full caster Polymorph  expert Sorcerer, wizard, wu jen Mindbender Unique capability Mind -affecting expert  Sorcerer, warlock, wizard, wu jen Seeker of the song Noncaster Trade bard spells for  Bard  better music abilitiesSublime chord Alternate caster Trade bardic music for  Bard, sorcerer, wizard  better spellsSuel arcanamach Alternate caster Mage slayer  Fighter, ranger, rogue, warlock Wayfarer guide Unique capability Teleportation expert Sorcerer, wizard, wu jenWild mage Full caster Master of chaotic magic  Sorcerer, warmage, warlock, wizard, wu jen 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   18 620_17925_Chpt2.indd   18 9/15/04   2:49:44 PM 9/15/04   2:49:44 PMCHAPTER 2 PRESTIGE CLASSES 19ACOLYTE OF THE SKIN The temptation of power drives some people to extreme lengths, regardless of the consequences. Replacing your own skin with that of a living demon is a goal that most couldn ’t even conceive of, let alone consider. But this ghastly fate is exactly what some spellcasters seek in their desperate quest. The Ritual of Bonding is a blasphemy that was long ago eradicated from most arcane libraries, but a few barely legible copies —or at least references thereto —survive along with promises of great power. Spellcasters who happen upon such documents can choose to destroy or ignore the ﬁ nd, but the temptation has already occurred. Those who give in can eventually stumble upon the complete ritual, usually through extended contact with one or more summoned ﬁ ends that are all too eager to share their terrible knowledge. The Ritual of Bonding is painful and not to be undertaken lightly. The ritual requires 10 rounds from initiation to com- pletion, and, once begun, nothing can halt its progress. The ﬁ endish essence consumes the caster ’s own skin, an agonizing process that deals 1d4 points of damage in each round of the ritual —wise candidates keep some cure potions on hand. At the end of the rite, the acolyte ’s skin sports an oily, almost unnoticeable sheen. However, as he gains additional levels in the prestige class, his skin darkens, sprouts spikes, and gradually gives him a ﬁ endish visage. The ﬁ endish essence also begins to whisper foul secrets to its wearer, urging him to evil. (The wearer can accept or ignore this advice according to his temperament.) Acolytes of the skin are ill suited for any position other than one that provides temporal power. Although NPC aco-lytes might sometimes serve more powerful evil characters as sinister captains, they would rather be calling the shots. They prefer to remain safely ensconced in well-defended fortresses of evil, though sometimes an acolyte might lead an expedition to retrieve a rumored tome of evil arcane magic or other artifact of malign power. Adaptation:  Almost any setting can accommodate the notion of those who go to any length to grab power for themselves, even so far as to bind demons to their own ﬂ esh. If your world does not include demons, per se, you could link this class to some other malign force or race of supernatural evil creatures instead of demons. For instance, an acolyte of the skin could be a scholar who unearths an ancient treatise on the topic of humanoid interspecies blending. Hit Die:  d8. REQUIREMENTS To qualify to become an acolyte of the skin, a character must fulﬁ ll all the following criteria.",

She no longer takes ability penal-ties for aging and cannot be magically aged (see Table 6 –5, page 109 of the Player ’s Handbook ). Ability score bonuses from aging still accrue, and any penalties the alienist might have already taken remain in place. An alienist is stolen away by horrible entities when her time is up, and she is never seen again. Alien Transcendence (Su):  A 10th-level alienist, because of long association with alien entities and intense study of insane secrets, transcends her mortal form and becomes an alien creature. Her type changes to outsider. Additionally, she gains damage reduction 10/magic and resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10. Upon achieving alien transcendence, an alienist undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a small tentacle or other strange feature, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. An alienist can hide this abnormal-ity in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist ’s control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. This applies a –4 penalty on Disguise checks an alienist makes to conceal her true nature. Anyone who shares an alienist ’s predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Cha- risma-based skill checks and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks involving any other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature.SAMPLE ALIENIST",

ARGENT SAVANT Of all the energies summoned or shaped by magic, force is perhaps the most pure. No analog for this power exists in the physical world; it comes into being only through the medium of spells, and therefore represents a perfection of intent that contradicts the imperfection of the everchanging world and its mutable elements. Sometimes referred to as the “force mage, ” the argent savant regards spells that evoke or apply magical force as the noblest and most fascinating spells at her disposal, and she seeks to increase her understanding and control of this mystical power at every opportunity. Most argent savants are evokers or abjurers, or sorcerers who choose a number of force spells as they advance in level. Without some facility at the manipulation of magical force, a spellcaster cannot embark on the secret studies of the argent savant. NPC argent savants sometimes join groups that aim to take on a powerful wizard or sorcerer who has protected his domicile with powerful wards of force. Argent savants of sufﬁ cient ability can dissolve the force effects of others.",

Through long study and experimentation, he learns to infuse his creations with a pseudolife far more resilient and vital than that which animates similar creations of other spellcasters. The ef ﬁ gy master brings to life sculptures made of clay, snow, wax, or mud, and uses this ability to create guardians, defenses, and even companions and cohorts. At the same time, the ef ﬁ gy master continues to study the secrets of magic, albeit at a slower pace. Ef ﬁ gy masters are often wizards who seek the knowledge of imparting life to nonliving elements as a means to create loyal minions that don ’t require much maintenance. Sorcer- ers also sometimes become ef ﬁ gy masters, although they generally don ’t pursue the class for long. NPC ef ﬁ gy masters are unusual individuals. Some sell their services to wealthy lords or merchants who desire retinues of absolutely loyal guards who cannot be charmed or bought. Others are experimenters who indulge in the process of creating pseudolife to satisfy their own curiosity and inquisitiveness. A few are bitter and spiteful loners who delight in creating mockeries of the living or seek to attain power by replacing those who have what the ef ﬁ gy master desires.",

Beneath its emerald light, kings rise or fall, weird monsters and magical plagues appear to scour the land, and strange and ancient secrets are revealed. Glorious and sinister auroras glimmer in the dusk for weeks on end, and from time to time shooting stars of burning emerald fall from the sky. These fallen stars are the only known source of starmetal, a rare and precious ore infused with mighty magical power. A Green Star adept is the master of the strange and powerful magic derived from Alhazarde ’s glittering green starmetal. He travels the land, searching for more of the comet ’s fallen substance and mastering its eldritch power. Turning his back on the traditional studies of the sorcerer or wizard, he slowly transforms into a living statue of starmetal, gaining immortality and invulnerability at the cost of his own ﬂ esh. At each appearance of the comet, only a handful of adepts can complete the rites necessary to achieve this transformation. Sorcerers and wizards are most capable of understanding the strange arcana of the mystic comet. Of the two, wizards are more likely to master the astrological calculations and m e t i c u l o u s  o b s e rv a t i o n s  r e q u i r e d  t o  d i v i n e  t h e  s e c r e t s  o f the Green Star. Some Green Star adepts, however, come from entirely different origins, having picked up the necessary arcane knowledge along the way. Such rare individuals might be learned monks or warlocks, sinister rogue/sorcerers, or any other character diligent enough to learn the secrets of the comet Alhazarde. All Green Star adepts are bitter rivals, since all who follow the path are in constant competition for the rare and precious starmetal required for the transformation. NPC Green Star adepts never work with each other, often going to great lengths to keep oth er adepts from learning about news of starmetal ﬁ nds.",

A creature crossing a red veil takes 20 points of ﬁ re damage (Re ﬂ ex half). A cone of cold  spell or effect destroys a warding with this veil but is negated in the process.

A warding  with this veil halts magical ranged attacks, including spells that conjure missiles (such as Melf ’s acid arrow ) or create rays (such as disintegrate  or a beholder ’s eye rays) but not spells that do not require a ranged attack (such as magic missile ).

Duties include putting in an appearance on campus at least once every six months and accepting any special commissions handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls into arrears on his dues by more than three months has his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool. Reinstating membership is dif ﬁ cult. However, ex-members do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained while in good standing. A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can browse the Order ’s well-respected library, which is stocked with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore ( though no spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order ’s common laboratory facilities when creating magic items (although material costs remain out-of-pocket). Furthermore, he is free to read and post notices to the “job board, ” a mun- dane medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass information, advertise their interest in a research topic or adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical or otherwise. Last but not least, members form professional ties with their fellow wizards, possibly leading to lasting friendships or alliances. Spellpool (Su):  Mages of the Arcane Order can call spells from a common source: the Spellpool. New members receive a special focus (a trinket chosen by the spellcaster, such as a ring, brooch, scarf, or other portable item) at the time of their initiation. The focus allows access to the Spellpool and works only for its owner. If a mage of the Arcane Order loses his focus, he must undergo another initiation. The range of available spells increases at 4th and 7th levels. See the sidebar below for details. Bonus Metamagic Feat:  At 2nd level and again at 9th level, a mage of the Arcane Order gains sudden insight from studying the reconstructed texts of ancient magical grimoires. He gains a metamagic feat of his choice as a bonus feat. He must still meet the prerequisites of the feat. Bonus Language: At 3rd level and again at 6th level, a guildmage ’s access to the Order ’s superb library and resources allows him to learn a new language.",

The refrain has no effect on undead or nonliving creatures. Anthem of Thunder and Pain (Su):  A seeker of the song of 5th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music and gain some control over electrical energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to electricity 15. An ally bene ﬁ ts from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing. Anthem of Thunder and Pain, Refrain: When she uses the refrain with her anthem of thunder and pain, a seeker shoots a ray of electricity from her ﬁ ngertips. The ray has a range of 20 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to a creature it hits. The seeker can then cause the electricity to arc to additional foes, all of whom must be within 20 feet of the ﬁ rst creature struck. Each secondary ray requires another ranged touch attack to hit and deals half as much damage as the initial ray. A seeker can create one secondary ray for every three seeker class levels (one when the song becomes available at 5th level, two at 6th level, and three at 9th level). No creature can be affected by more than one arc in a single round. Hymn of Spelldeath (Su):  A seeker of the song of 6th level or higher with 19 or more ranks in a Perform skill can turn the power of the primal music against magic effects. Any creature that can hear the seeker perform must make a Concentration check opposed by the seeker ’s Perform c h e c k  i n  o r d e r  t o  c a s t  a  s p e l l .  I f  t h e Concentration check fails, the spell is lost and has no effect. If the Con- centration check succeeds, the spell is cast as normal. A hymn of spelldeath is a mind-affecting ability.",

        "description":  "Knowledge (nature) 4 ranks, Energy Substitution (electricity). Bene ﬁ t: When you cast a spell with either the electricity descriptor or the sonic descriptor that deals hit point damage, you can declare that spell to be a spell of the three thunders, with half its damage dealt as electricity damage and half dealt as sonic damage. In addition, the spell concludes with a mighty thunderclap that stuns all creatures that take damage from the spell for 1 round unless they succeed on a Fortitude save, then knocks stunned creatures prone unless they suc-ceed on a Re ﬂ ex save (both saves at the same DC as the base spell). Channeling the three thunders is costly, though, and you are automatically dazed for 1 round after doing so. A three thunders spell uses a spell slot of the spell ’s normal level. In addition, its descriptor changes to include both energy types —for example, a lightning bolt  of the three thunders is an evocation [electricity, sonic] spell. CHAIN SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target. Prerequisite:  Any metamagic feat. Bene ﬁ t: Any spell that speci ﬁ es a single target and has a range greater than touch can be chained so as to affect that primary target normally, then arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Each arc affects one secondary target chosen by you, all of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and none of which can be affected more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum. If the chained spell deals damage, the sec- ondary targets each take half as much damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Re ﬂ ex saving throws for half damage (whether the spell allows the original target a save or not). For spells that don ’t deal damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by  4. For example, if a 10th-level wizard nor- mally casts cause fear  at DC 14, a chained cause fear could target a goblin chieftain at DC 14 and up to ten of his nearby guards at DC 10. A chained spell uses up a spell slot three lev- els higher than the spell ’s actual level. COMMUNICATOR You possess a magical understanding of the essence of language.

For example, two wizards and two sorcerers standing in a circle all have Cooperative Spell. The ﬁ rst three in the initiative order ready an action to cast ﬁ reball , casting the spell when the fourth does. The base DC of the spell ’s save is equal to the highest save DC among the cooperative casters (as determined by relevant ability scores, other feats, special abilities, or items) +4 (+2 for the ﬁ rst cooperative caster and +1 for each of the other two). As well, whoever has the highest caster level determines the base caster level check, which gains a +3 bonus (+1 for each cooperative caster). CRAFT CONTINGENT SPELL [ITEM CREATION] You know how to attach semipermanent spells to a creature and set them to activate under certain conditions. Prerequisite : Caster level 11th. Bene ﬁ t: You can make contingent any spell that you know. Crafting a contingent spell takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price (spell level × caster level × 100 gp). To craft a contingent spell, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the base price. Some spells incur extra costs in material components or XP (as noted in their descriptions), which must be paid when the contingent spell is created. See Contingent Spells, page 139, for more information. DELAY SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can cast spells that take effect after a short delay of your choosing. Prerequisite:  Any metamagic feat. Bene ﬁ t: When casting a spell, you set a delay of 1 to 5 rounds before it takes effect. The delay time cannot be changed once set; the spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided when the spell is cast, with any of its effects (including damage and saving throws) decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change during the delay period in ways that would make the spell impossible to cast (the target you designate moves beyond the spell ’s range, for example), the spell fails. During the delay period, a delayed spell can be dispelled normally, and it can be detected in the area or on the target (as applicable). A delayed spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell ’s actual level. DOUBLE WAND WIELDER You can activate two wands at the same time.",

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different type of en-ergy each time. EXPLOSIVE SPELL [METAMAGIC] You can cast spells that blast creatures off their feet. Bene ﬁ t: On a failed Reﬂ ex save, an explo- sive spell ejects any creature caught in its area, sending it to a location outside the nearest edge of that area, dealing additional damage and further knocking crea-tures prone. For example, all creatures in the area of an explosive fireball  that fail their saving throws not only take full damage but are pushed to the clos- est square outside the perimeter of the spell ’s 20-foot-radius spread. Likewise, an explosive lightning bolt  moves targets that fail their saves to outside the area de ﬁ ned by the squares the bolt ’s line passes through. Any creature moved in this manner also takes an additional 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet moved (no addi-tional damage if moved less than 10 feet by the effect) and is knocked prone. If some obstacle prevents a blasted creature from being moved to the edge of the effect, the creature is stopped and takes 1d6 points of damage from striking the barrier (in addition to any damage taken from the distance moved before then). In any event, this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Explosive Spell can be applied only to spells that allow Reﬂ ex saves and affect an area (a cone, cylinder, line, or burst).

Bene ﬁ t: Choose one of your spell-like abilities (subject to the restrictions below) to use at maximum effectiveness up to three times per day (or the ability ’s normal use limit, whichever is less). All variable, numeric effects of the spell- like ability are maximized, dealing maximum damage, curing the maximum number of hit points, affecting the maximum number of targets, and so on. For example, a 10th-level warlock ’s maximized eldritch blast  deals 36 points of damage three times per day. Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you cast dispel magic ) are not affected, nor are spell-like abilities without random variables. An empowered maximized spell-like ability gains the bene ﬁ t of each feat separately (getting the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result). For example, a ﬁ re mephit ’s empowered maximized scorching ray  would deal 24 points of damage plus one-half of 4d6 points of damage. The spell-like ability you wish to maximize can be chosen only from those abilities that duplicate a spell of a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down), minus 2. For a summary, see the Caster Level to Empower column in the table on page 304 of the Monster Manual .",

In addition, when facing a creature protected by mirror image , you can immediately pick out the real creature from its ﬁ gments. Your ability to ignore the miss chance granted by magical concealment doesn ’t grant you any ability to ignore nonmagical conceal- ment (so you would still have a 20% miss chance against an invisible  creature hiding in fog, for example).",

A spell whose effects wouldn ’t stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned (see Combining Magical Effects, page 171 of the Player ’s Handbook ). For example, a twinned charm person  doesn ’t create a more potent or long-lasting effect, but any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling, so a single successful counterspell negates both instances of a twinned spell.
