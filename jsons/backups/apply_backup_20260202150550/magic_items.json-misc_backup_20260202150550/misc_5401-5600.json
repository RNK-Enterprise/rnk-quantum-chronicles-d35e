Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round. ASTRAL LINKS The Astral Plane is omnipresent and can potentially have links to every other plane in your cosmology. You can restrict the Astral Plane’s connection to particular planes (see the Option: Without the Astral sidebar), but in gen- eral the Astral Plane connects everywhere. Many individuals pass through the Astral Plane without realizing it when they cast certain spells or use interplanar portals. They find themselves on the Astral Plane only when something goes wrong, such as a badly cast dimension doorspell or a bag of holdingstuffed inside a portable hole. When something has to go somewhere else but has no other direction to go, it usually ends up on the Astral Plane. There can be permanent portals between various planes and the Astral Plane. Outsiders that otherwise lack plane- traveling abilities use these portals to get to the Astral Plane. A number of openings known as color pools connect the Astral Plane to other planes. Color pools are irregular disks of a particular color floating in the vastness of the Astral Plane. The color of the pool tells the astral traveler what plane is on the other end of the color pool. Seven out of every ten color pools are one-way portals leading only to the plane in question. The remaining three out of ten allow two-way access. The astral projectionspell still connects through such color pools regardless of their direction, so an individual moving onto a new plane can still retreat to the Astral Plane through a one-way portal. Portals that pass through the Astral Plane to other planes form conduits, which appear as large trails of dark gray against the astral sky. Travelers can reach a particular location on another plane by latching onto one of these conduits and following it to one of its destinations, although this can be a perilous way to travel. Conduits flex and weave as they move through the Astral Plane, and successfully catching one of them is akin to hitching a ride on a tornado. Grabbing a conduit requires a Will saving throw (DC 20). Failure means the individual is flung violently away from the conduit and takes 1d10 points of damage from the astral turbulence. Success indicates that the traveler has latched onto the conduit and moves instantly onto one of the two planes the conduit connects. Conduits tend to flow either in one direction or the other, but they do not change their direction of flow frequently, so individuals who hitch a ride on a conduit in quick succes- sion wind up on the same plane. An astral form that joins a conduit forms a new body at the destination plane. The advantage of using a conduit is that the traveler likely has a way back out of the destination plane. The dis- advantage is that it’s impossible to tell by looking where a conduit is coming from or where it’s going. Conduits are :5 RETPAHC EVITISNART EHT SENALP AAssttrraall CCoolloorr PPoooollss CCeelleessttiiaa BByyttooppiiaa EEllyyssiiuumm TThhee BBeeaassttllaannddss AArrbboorreeaa YYssggaarrdd LLiimmbboo PPaannddeemmoonniiuumm TThhee AAbbyyssss CCaarrcceerrii TThhee GGrraayy WWaassttee GGeehheennnnaa TThhee NNiinnee HHeellllss AAcchheerroonn MMeecchhaannuuss AArrccaaddiiaa TThhee OOuuttllaannddss MMaatteerriiaall PPllaannee EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff FFiirree EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff EEaarrtthh EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff WWaatteerr EElleemmeennttaall PPllaannee ooff AAiirr PPoossiittiivvee EEnneerrggyy PPllaannee NNeeggaattiivvee EEnneerrggyy PPllaannee PPllaannee ooff SShhaaddooww EEtthheerreeaall DDeemmiippllaanneess ((VVaarriieess)) 48 often used by astral travelers who have no other means of Traveling Elsewhere: If an astral form passes through transportation and need to get off the Astral Plane quickly. a color pool or otherwise manifests on another plane, it forms a new body from the building blocks of the plane Table 5–1: Random Color Pools for the D\u0026D itself.

They brew up out of nowhere and pose a hazard to ethereal travelers in the area. They are usually as temporary as thunderstorms on the Mater- ial Plane, but sometimes a more permanent ether cyclone can develop, lasting for years or even centuries. To those on the Material Plane, the ether cyclone has no effect beyond a shiver down one’s spine or strange behavior from nearby animals. But on the Ethereal Plane, the ether cyclone is an incredibly strong wind. Clothing, hair, and unattended objects are blown about, and eventually a traveler is uprooted and spun through the Ethereal Plane to an unknown fate.

An eerie howling increases with each round, and with a brutal suddenness the ether cyclone tears at everything in its path. Travelers can flee the ether cyclone by moving onto the coexistent plane or seeking shelter. Spells with the force descriptor, such as Leomund’s tiny hut, protect the traveler from the effects of an ether cyclone, but weather spells such as control wind andcontrol weatherhave no effect on an ether cyclone. It’s otherwise impossible to outrun an ether cyclone. One of the greatest dangers of an ether cyclone is how it can scatter a group of adventurers, leaving them unable to find each other—or to find exits from the Ethereal Plane. At the DM’s option, roll only once on the table below for a group of travelers, provided they are relatively close to each other when the ether cyclone strikes.

Ordinary creatures find Pandemonium indistinguishable from the Material Plane (the alterable morphic trait, in other words). Spells and physical effort affect Pande- monium normally. • No Elemental or Energy Traits. • Mildly Chaos-Aligned: Lawful characters on the plane of Pandemonium suffer a –2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. • Normal Magic.

Half-air elementals often have their hair blown about in mysterious breezes and a breathy voice. Sometimes people describe them as flighty, for it’s hard for them to concentrate too long on any one topic. Half-earth elementals have a rocky sheen to their flesh. They are often slow to act but stubborn once committed. Half-fire elementals have a reddish tint to their hair, eyes, or skin. They are temperamental and quick to jump to conclusions. Half-water elementals have a blue-green hue about them—either in their hair or their skin. They are usually nurturing and giving, but terrible when angered. Creating a Half-Elemental “Half-elemental” is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more (referred to hereafter as the “base creature”).

CHAPTER 1: NATURE\u0027S LORE Half-Elves: Lost and looking for her place in the world, many a half-elf finds solace in serving nature. Per- haps it’s a way of accepting her elven half or appeasing elven kin—or perhaps the half-elf whom society has cast aside finds a certain appeal in the sometimes lonely path of the druid. Whatever her reasons for taking up the class, the half-elven druid benefits from her elven her- itage through her improved vision. Half-elves may also have an easier time getting along in a human-dominated world than elves do. Half-orcs: It’s unfortunate that so few half-orcs take up the druidic path. Like their orc parents, many half- orcs live in wild frontiers, often far away from settled and well-defended towns. Those same frontiers are often home to druids. Halt-orc characters have two significant advantages: darkvision and a +2 racial bonus to Strength. Moreover, although some may mock the half-orc for her lack of intelligence and her crudeness, a druid can live without great intelligence and charisma. Like the half- elf, the half-orc must live with a degree of social stigma, so she may find a solitary existence in the woods prefer- able to dealing with those who can’t accept her for what she is. Nature, after all, embraces all living beings and brings peace to the tormented soul.",

The creator may assem- ble the body personally or hire someone else to do it. Creating the mannequin requires a Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check (DC 12). Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creature’s body, that process and the ritual can be performed together. When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused. On the final day of the ritual, the creator must person- ally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers. Big Sky Enchantment (Compulsion) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]",

These feats deal mostly with tactical combat. SUDDEN METAMAGIC FEATS Sudden metamagic feats are a new kind of metamagic feat. You choose whether to apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell as you cast the spell. You can apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell of any level, and it does not affect the spell’s level for the purpose of determining which spell slot it occupies. You can apply a sudden metamagic feat to a spell that has already been enhanced by a regular metamagic feat. However, the sudden metamagic feat cannot be of the same type as the reg- ular metamagic feat (for instance, you can’t use Sudden Extend on a spell that has already been extended). A sudden metamagic feat doesn’t require a full-round action from casters who choose spells as they cast them, such as sorcer- ers and bards.
